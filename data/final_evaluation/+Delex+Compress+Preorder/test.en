resolutely support the thread starter ! i compose a poem in reply :
pledge to fight to the death defending the __name1__ and the related islands
fleets bumping fishing boats . little evil __name1__ ghosts stirring up trouble and unrest . with hearts of thieves and arrogant form , they again show their wolfish appearance
never go back to that time , our humiliating appearance when signing the treaties . __name1__ be strong , swords be sharp and knives be shining , let 's bury the approaching enemies !
__month1__ __day1__ th , __year1__
i agree with the analysis of the thread starter , resolutely bump up . if war really comes , i would like to be __name1__ , to protect our home and defend our homeland , to spread the prestige of our __name2__ , to pledge to fight to the death defending our national dignity .
i very much wish i had been born in those passionate and upsurging times of __name2__ , the __name1__ , losing my head and shedding my blood , completely extinguishing all the enemies that wrong __name3__ , spreading our dragon prestige !
how long are we going to tolerate __name1__ ?
my fellow citizens :
hello , everyone ! we all know the " __name3__ 18 th " incident , but now __name1__ again has a premeditated plan for another " __name3__ 18 th " on the sea , another " __name2__ on the sea ".
__name1__ surprisingly defied the strong condemnation of the whole world , openly invaded our country 's sacred territory , " the __name2__ ".
as we all know , the " __name1__ " have always belonged to __name2__ ; due to historical reasons , what originally belongs us has become controversial .
my fellow citizens , ours is ours , what need is there to negotiate ! __name1__ thus goes even further - wants to create a fact of occupation . can we allow this ? no - absolutely not !
my fellow citizens , __name1__ 's militarism has brought the people of __name2__ grave disasters .
especially __name1__ suffered the ravages of __name2__ for as long as several decades .
in the __name5__ , __name2__ __name1__ cruelly conducted human body experiments on living people of __name3__ , __name4__ and other countries , the method of which were extremely brutal ; the __name6__ added a layer of blood to the ancient capital which will never fade away ; the big bloody battles at __name7__ and __name8__ laid bare the bones of the dead over a __quant1__ kilometers and killed off everything ...
my fellow citizens , of the heinous crimes committed by __name1__ in __name2__ , there are too many instances to cite , difficult to record without exhausting all bamboo strips .
it 's just as if those __quant1__ deceased souls who lost their lives are wandering over the __name1__ , finding it difficult to rest in peace .
all the people who experienced that era must still remember it vividly ; even our younger generations also will cry with tears streaming down our cheeks , and our blood boils with indignation , whenever we turn to this page of history and read !
now __name1__ actually wants to reverse the verdict on the history of its aggression - fellow citizens , fellow __name2__ in __name3__ , wake up !
although it is painful to look back at these __quant1__ years of shame , we must go face it ; although historical issues have not been resolved , let us create and choose history !
since there is responsibility , we are not afraid . the territory is small , but it is related to the matter of dignity ; no matter how the winds and clouds changes , the interests of the country and national unity are the guarantee of honor ; even though scarred with wounds , we can not let our native lands be separated !
my fellow citizens , for the __name1__ nation , the advent of the twenty @-@ first century means a time when we are beset with difficulties inside while being pressed from outside , and we will face many challenges .
the __name1__ issue , the __name2__ issue , the __name3__ issue , the surrounding environment , as well as the foreign forces which are aggressive to __name4__ - which way should we go ?
what to do , fellow citizens ? please take a look at the map of the world , that crescent @-@ shaped encirclement is suppressing our breathing , strangling our development , and coveting our national territory .
we do not want to make enemies , but are never afraid of enemies ; we do not want war , but are never afraid of war .
we must urgently arrange arms , strengthen all military forces on land , on sea , and in the air .
over __quant1__ of years , the __name1__ nation has flourished several times , but before it has never had ambition to expand its territory outward .
not imposing on others what we do n't want ourselves , what we follow is a foreign security strategic philosophy which applies benevolence and virtue .
the tolerance and liberalness of a country are like those of an individual - we avoid hurting others , but must insist on not being hurt ourselves .
tolerance is certainly not fear , and sincerity does not have to be cowardice .
__name1__ exempting __name2__ from war reparations for __name3__ was in service of peace , benevolent peace .
my fellow citizens , the __name2__ is a condensed history of the __name1__ nation striving for continuous self @-@ improvement
the solemn and magnificent posture represents a sacred expectation for peace .
the thought @-@ strings of my memory have been agitated from time to time - many heroic , stirring , and tragic scenes of shining spears and armored horses spring up in my mind .
my thoughts go through those yellowing pages of history , as if i saw emperor __name1__ , the famous ruler of a generation , contemplating alone about how to achieve unification of the territory in his audience hall , __quant1__ of years ago ; also as if i saw __name2__ , former __name4__ president , wandering alone in the dark of a great hall , thinking about the integrity of the __name3__ .
" although it is peaceful throughout the world , it is certainly dangerous to forget war ! " my fellow citizens , we want development and peace , but we must never exercise forbearance blindly . the " __name1__ " of national betrayal and humiliation has aggravated __name2__ 's poverty and backwardness in modern time - falling behind will lead to being bullied .
without strength , where does peace come from !
we must focus on national defense education , build up a great wall in the hearts of __quant1__ people , and must establish the full range of a national defense system having the ability to both attack and defend ;
the best defense is to attack - we should strengthen forces which can engage in ultra @-@ long @-@ range attack , improve combat capability throughout all of aerospace , of great depth , and over great distances . on the premise of avoiding influence on national economic development , increase investment and construction of the defense industry , accelerate modernization and internationalization of military equipment , and establish a high @-@ quality , high @-@ tech elite division .
the battle horn is about to sound , the people are already fully equipped and ready to go .
without the people 's support we will accomplish nothing ; with the support of the people , we will be all @-@ powerful .
my fellow citizens , it is time for us to say " no " to others . therefore , we must achieve :
1 . establish guaranteed funds , improve working environment and mechanisms , recruit back to __name2__ the hundreds of thousands of it professionals who have emigrated to and linger in the __name1__ and around the world .
2 . create a few nuclear @-@ powered aircraft carrier battle groups .
3 . manufacture __quant1__ advanced combat aircraft of various kinds .
4 . accelerate the research and deployment of high @-@ speed intercontinental ballistic missiles which can break missile defense systems and whose range is more than __quant1__ nautical miles .
5 . resume nuclear experiments , and establish military forces in space .
6 . retain __quant1__ nuclear bombs equivalent to __quant2__ tons of tnt , and when necessary , install nuclear warheads on all short @- and middle @-@ range missiles .
7 . retain __quant1__ strategic nuclear submarines with the ability to inflict __quant2__ devastating nuclear strikes against enemies .
8 . abandon the commitment to not use nuclear weapons first .
9 . retain the right of pre @-@ emptive strike when national security is threatened .
my fellow citizens , only if we have self @-@ confidence and self @-@ improvement , can we strive to be strong . __name1__ unified __name2__ . __name3__ recovered __name4__ . in our responsibilities we must carry on the farsightedness , insight , and strong will of our predecessors .
now , that piece of land trembling far away from the embrace of the motherland is shaking , moaning , and calling . fellow citizens , let us carry forward the unfulfilled wishes of previous generals , moving forward courageously !
when reading over history , the heaviness and anger in my heart simmer into concern for the nation . although i was born to cloth gown and am one of the common people , for the prosperity of the motherland , for the motherland being splendid once again , i am willing to voluntarily serve our country , and i will have no regrets even if i die ! my sincere patriotic heart is adequate to show to heaven !
here , i 've composed a poem in classical __name1__ form , to voice the aspirations of my heart .
paint the deep red lips
protect the __name1__
bitterly lost our __name1__
how can we allow the __name1__ to fall to other countries
__quant1__ years of vicissitudes
smoke and clouds chase the flying waves
youngest brother is still a tender youth
wandering in all directions , bearing a seal
looking over to the flag
brandish our weapons and cross to the east
let the horses drink from the __name1__
__month1__ , __day1__ th , __year1__
other articles : " a book for __name1__ compatriots @-@ i have a dream ", " the necessity for building memorials museums or temples for chinese national heroes ", " how long will we tolerate it ", " __name2__ is expecting the olympics , but would never beg for the __name3__ ", " if we forget the hardship of history , there will be more history of hardship ", " i am chinese ", " there is only __quant1__ chinese nation , there is only __quant2__ chinese culture ", " with the over @-@ development of sports , the state may decline ", "' wealthy country , strong people ' or ' wealthy officials , poor people "?", " disgusting ren zhiqiang , shut your filthy mouth ", " hateful housing prices ! pitiable people ! ", " __name4__ , you have no right to make irresponsible remarks to china ", " how long will we tolerate the __name5__ ", " __name6__ deserved the bombing @-@ strongly oppose __name7__ @-@ moon presenting a bouquet in __name8__ ", " be strong , my brothers and sisters ", " do we need low @-@ level entertainment stars , or talents in technological innovation ? ", " contemporary garbage writer , shameless __name9__ , please let the children off the hook "
why do n't we fight with little __name1__ ?
what do __name1__ still tolerate ...
they are riding even on our head
is this still what __name1__ with guts do ?
we should tell the whole world , that __name1__ can n't be bullied at will by others ...
it is time to show our strength ! __name1__ has been calm for too long !
currently our citizens ' lives are all too carefree ! the officials are too extravagant .
now we already have no cohesion ! __name1__ needs to start a war ! a harsh slap in the face of the countries which follow the __name2__ ' rear !
let them know that the __name1__ is not a panacea ! if we win , it may increase __name2__ 's influence ! and improve the cohesion of the citizenry ! if we lose , we can clean out those incompetent bureaucrats , and make those trash get out ! let __name3__ have new blood and get updated . , get up , __name4__ !
go , __name1__ , go
i suggest that __name1__ strengthens the guard on the __name2__ , make it __quant1__ , protect the fishermen and the sovereignty of our country ; if __name3__ dares to invade our territory with military force , we will fight a small @-@ scale war of self @-@ defense , regardless of the cost . __name4__ can not lose !
we need shows in life , but it is really __value1__ to show yourself within someone 's embrace .
i 'm just passing by
the whole society is like this , not to mention the stars
damn it being not sexy
it 's totally unacceptable
agree , just cheap entertainers . their reputation in feudal __name1__ somewhat makes sense .
their life looks glorious
a group of people of __quant1__ professions
life is hard .
:shocked :
that 's normal , it has always been the case that a whore is heartless and a performer is unrighteous
they want money , not the face
have a look at the " wolf with glasses " near ms. fan , you will know the actress has no choice but drink with him or she will be forced out or even framed .
sob
it 's ok as long as there is something to eat :loveliness :
no one is easy . life is like a show , you must have a look at the script to know how to perform
all are sb
there are top scorer in the __name1__ in all __quant1__ walks of life ! what effort and endeavor behind those top scorer in the __name2__ ! this is humiliating the word " bean vermicelli "!
haha
overdoing
the reality
shoot those hooligans
cheap performers
cheap performers !
the entertainment circle is a dirty one , all men in it are birds and beasts and scum
pity them , but who is to blame ? those female stars are not easy
everybody is doing this , how can you make money if you do n't do this
she is a proud woman in front of others but is in melancholy mood when staying alone ...
to put it plainly stars nowadays are just popular prostitutes in ancient times . now that they are famous prostitutes , it should be just normal to drink with some high officials or even sleep with them
stop talking about others just behave yourself
what should we do in the future ! ability alone is n't enough to become successful ! are we goin ' to face such hard choices too ?
more suffering is under the disguise of glorious looks , ' tis the undisputable fact .
it 's not so bad , they 're just playing in their own circle , out of sight , out of mind ,
not like the old guy zhang jizhong not only behaved like a hooligan in his own circle , but also thinks he is virtuous without any talent . he makes tv series when he has nothing to do to wreck people of the whole country .
both take what they need
when can __name1__ have a pure , innocent girl ?
a story is now very shocking in the entertainment world . it is rumored that __name1__ has been forced out because she refused to drink with a guest as arranged by the company and has to switch to work as a lawyer 's assistant instead to make ends meet .
much envied super stars often encounter social engagements or circumstances which they do n't welcome but have to join in ,
after all , there are many things they can n't decide themselves ' cause that will have to do with many aspects and the interests of many people ,
sometimes a dinner party which seems very normal for us ordinary people may not be that simple for stars as we imagined .
a star will have lots of contracts and her source of money will be rolling if she tackles well ; if she does n't tack well , what comes after her heel would be forcing out or even frame @-@ ups ...
there are __quant1__ kinds of smart female stars . those of the __value1__ kind always hold very high integrity and sternly reject all such invitations ;
the __value1__ kind are good at playing the trick and making their objectives achieved with their seed money ,
it 's rumored that even some super female stars won their __value1__ roles in this way .
after drinking some alcohol , the advertiser or show sponsor may take the chance to lie on the female star 's shoulder , feel her chin or kiss her cheek , and endurance is the attitude most adopted by the female stars .
they are the very people of lower __quant1__ professions
those stars are just pretending , they are all actually living a much damned better life than this
agree , just cheap entertainers . their reputation in feudal __name1__ somewhat makes sense .
agree !
ah well , it is not easy to be an actress
they deserve it . they asked for that .
it dawned on me nothing is easy !
the women are birds and beasts , and the men are worse than birds and beasts
braawwk !
braawwkkk !
it did n't take long .
__name1__ , the circumferential highway running around the south - western quadrant of the richmond new urban region , opened in late __year1__ .
already it is changing development patterns for the worse and causing localized traffic congestion around its exits .
the __name1__ - __name1__ tells the tale today about the impact on the huguenot trail in __name2__ .
traffic has more than doubled in __quant1__ section of huguenot trail since __name1__ opened , reports will jones .
speeding and accidents have surged as well :
__quant1__ accidents have been reported near the intersection of winterfield road so far this year , up from __quant2__ for all of __year1__ .
dale totten , resident engineer for the __name1__ , noted that vdot would __quant1__ - lane the road for about $ __quant2__ if it had more money .
of course , __name1__ has no more money for road construction in the __name2__ region .
one reason is that __name1__ , at the behest of local politicians and boosters , spent all its friggin ' money on __name2__ !
where 's __name1__ when you need him ?
this is a major `` d'oh ! '' moment .
as we predicted , __name1__ is generating residential development in scarcely populated areas all around its exits , overtaxing the local country roads .
while the limited access highway might provide limited traffic relief for people driving back and forth between __name1__ and __name2__ , other people are making choices about where they live and work ,
and they are creating traffic congestion in new places .
the only thing that surprises me is how rapidly this is happening .
even i thought there might be a lag of __quant1__ or __quant2__ years .
if __name1__ has already created a $ __quant1__ road - construction in just this __quant2__ exist , think of the liability it has created for all of its exits !
here 's another prodiction :
after a few more years of scattered subdivision development and approval of mega @-@ commercial projects at major __name1__ intersections , the need for new road improvements will soar .
before the end of the decade , we may well see the unfunded liability zoom well past the original $ __quant1__ it took to build the original highway .
to the brainiacs who thought __name1__ was such a great idea :
thanks for nothing .
i think we could have spent the $ __quant1__ better elsewhere .
i do n't think you can blame __name1__ for creating those people .
if there enough of them to create new traffic congestion in new places , then what is the alternative ?
additional traffic congestion in old places ?
now you understand how people like tmt in __name1__ feel .
i 'd usually take the pro @-@ road position -
but with the glaring needs in other parts of the state , __name1__ was definitely excess ...
you have a city , __name1__ , that has virtually no traffic .
the rush hour is __quant1__ minutes long ...
and you give them a beltway through a largely rural area .
a road to no where ...
just think if this money had been spent on another __name1__ crossing or road improvements that are desperately needed in __name2__ ?
virginia centrist , to add insult to injury , the rest of the state helped pay for __name1__ in last year 's budget deal -- wiped the slate clean of debt .
it was very nice of y'all to oblige us .
did n't make much sense , though .
it 's the same old problem .
if you get out ahead of the need you are accused of causing sprawl .
if you build where the need is already acute , then the claim is you can n't pave your way out of congestion .
anonymous -
that 's a fair point .
5 @:@ 26 makes a good point .
however , this situation hammers home the validity of the state auditor 's report finding that the __name1__ and __name2__ fail to fund transportation projects based on a comprehensive state transportation plan , but rather , based on whoever does the best job of lobbying .
i submit that this is a disgraceful situation that should not be tolerated .
moreover , senator __name1__ and his toadies would make this worse by pouring more money into this flawed institution .
what is the purpose of transportation - related expenditures ?
in __name1__ , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest .
you all are dead wrong .
no less than __name1__ stated that __name2__ money was intended to be paid from economic development money .
come on folks !!
tmt : i do n't understand your point .
when was the last time you were stuck in traffic that you were n't on your way to or from some sort of business ?
it seems to me that the whole point of roads is to facilitate the public interest in getting to and from private businesses .
then , of course there is the sunday drive , the trip to grandma 's , and the soccer games , but still , the overwhelming need is to support business .
since our road expenditures nowhere near match the increase in business or state domestic product , it is no wonder we suffer congestion problems .
if we recognize that roads primaarily benefit businesses then we should do __quant1__ things :
let business pay for more of our transportation bill , ( which they will pass to us , of course ) and incentivize them to locate where they put the least stress on the system , even if that means more overall travel .
why is it so hard to understand ?
the solution is functional human settlement patterns and a balance between transport system capacity and land use generated travel deman .
all else is spin .
emr
tmt said `` in __name1__ , it 's to benefit private business plans and not to serve the public interest . ''
i do n't see the point of this statement because it appears to demonize private business plans and put the public interest above all else .
i think they are so tightly intertwined that they are virtually one and the same .
obviously there are local problems because this cookie dough is lumpy ,
but in the aggregate if we demonize business long enough we will eventually find out we all work for the devil .
i do n't see there is any point in claiming as `` a solution '' a balance that is dynamic and ever changing in nature .
even you see rail to __name1__ as a positive because dulles is a job center that promotes bi @-@ directional demand on the rail .
i agree .
in fact that may be sufficient reason to build it , all by itself .
all i 'm saying is that the exact same logic should apply to roads :
they should have destinations at both ends in order that we get maximum use out of our investment :
we need more places in order to get closer to the balance you say we need .
reality check here -
i drive past watkins landing every morning and evening .
i commute back and forth to work on the huguenot trail .
i 've never seen anything remotely resembling a `` flood '' of traffic .
it 's a __quant1__ mph zone - 75 to 100 cars in `` a morning '' - over how much time ?
the huguenot trail road widening was already planned , due to the heavy demands of development on the __name1__ side , the new schools , and a whole bunch of existing developments that were zoned __quant1__ ago and at that time funneled through robious road .
__name1__ , for those of us that actually use it , is wonderful - instead of __name2__ and western __name3__ being bottlenecked by lack of roads ,
we can actually get some commercial development and have the ability to work closer to where we live .
you may think that 's not rational land use .
i have no desire to live in any city ,
i will not work in a downtown area ,
i will not use mass transit , which is not safe for female commuters that work long and irregular hours ,
and i happen to like large lot development .
how exactly __quant1__ 'm supposed to keep horses on a __quant1__ @/@ __quant1__ acre lot is beyond me .
gas could go to $ __quant2__ __quant1__ gallon
and i 'd still pay to live in the country .
many people have legitimate preferences - horses , hunting , gardening , certain types of small business - that makes them not want to live in an urban core .
this infatuation with city living truly baffles me .
anonymous 6 @:@ 37 , you have every right to live in the country if that 's where you wish to live .
but you do n't have a right to have the rest of the state to underwrite construction of a $ __quant1__ highway to make it easier to shop and get to work .
what 's consistently overlooked in the debate ovre __name1__ is what else that $ __quant1__ could have been spent on .
how much traffic congestion could have been alleviated had the money been applied to other pressing road projects or , god forbid , even non @-@ road projects .
ray hyde - my comments were directed at investors who lobby to place roads near where they own property and the incompetent system that funds these requests without regard to their link or lack thereof to a master transportation plan .
i am __quant1__ and a mother of a 2 and a half year old .
me and my son 's father have been broken up since __month1__ .
i want to start dating other people and my son 's father says if i do he will have nothing to do with his son .
he is very possesive and controlling but he has no right to be as we are not together .
he has too much going on in his life right now and he thinks we can work when i have told him several times i dont love him and he does not love me .
i want him to be there for his son without needing me too .
but he has no one his family and him dont get along and have their own issues .
i do n't want to be miserable anymore and the longer he is around the more miserable i will be .
i dont want him to not be there for his son as he is a good father or he at least tries .
i do believe every child needs both parents weather they are together or not .
but he thinks if he cant have me no one can .
what do i do to move on with my life .
your ex is threatening you using your son ... bad , bad , bad .
you can n't give in to that or it will just escalate .
you have a right to live your own life and be happy , so do n't cave to his threats .
if he really loves his son , he 'll see him regardless , but this is just a typical control method that people like him use .
others say things like , " i 'm going to kill myself if you leave me "... get it ?
date .
meet all kinds of people .
do what you want .
if the price is , he voluntarily walks out of both of your lives , you 're probably better off without him .
i 'd agree - __quant1__ other thing it is none of his business whether you date or not .
i would n't tell him .
not because of his threat - but because your personal life is none of his business .
can you document his threats ?
you really need to .
quit taking his calls , make him leave voice mail .
make him email or text you .
keep those records .
get a lawyer and get a divorce .
if you can n't afford one , try legal aid .
tell your ex that all communication needs to go through the lawyer .
the bus drivers want exact change , the till people want exact change , the people who deliver your food want exact change ...
do they not realise that you do n't get piles of change from the bank ,
someone somewhere is going to have to take the notes ?
people are getting lazy .
i do like to get as near as possible as i woudn't like to be couting coppers all day
take a £20 note on the bus , they just tell you to get on cos theyre lazy as hell
its illegal to pay certain amounts in loads of coins . such as you can only pay something like __quant1__ pence in __quant2__ ps
hello i started university in __month1__ , did n't immediately gel with it obviously like most people .
however , i knew it would take me some time to adjust , because i have always been very introverted , and shy and especially anxious and all the rest of it .
the __value1__ night i was here , all my housemates and i went out and it was the hardest thing i have ever ever had to do .
to go into the su bar on my own , sober .
anyways more to the point ; here are the facts :
- i am not enjoying university having been here __quant1__ months or so ; i 'm disillusioned by the course , not enjoying the projects set , and i do n't like the course delivery as much .
the university made out it was much better than it seems .
- i had a bad start to the __value1__ term ; student finance was delayed , adding to my stress levels , i was so worried i was unable to progress with work , conclusively it all piled up .
- i was assigned a counselor through the university ; had seen her for about __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ weeks ( block sessions ) , if i 'm honest it did n't really work ; because i was never open with her .
only half @-@ halfheartedly .
- now the work @-@ load is up to my neck , i have major deadlines to hit , i am depressed , the anxiety is resulting in me feeling miserable all the time .
in no longer have a counselor because you can only have them for so many sessions at a time , and i doubt it will help much this time , if it has n't already .
- i lack motivation , do n't feel comfortable with any of my lecturers , feel like i want to give in , but can n't bring myself to it , because i will end up in a dead end job , and i aspired to ' be someone '.
- i would rather be dead than not be educated , and live a life i want to live ( and dropping out of uni would make matters worse ) .
- i 'm __quant1__ yrs old ( turn __quant2__ this year ) , do n't have much time left for failing need to do something .
i failed college once over , did another course so i could get to uni do n't want to go through the system over and over and consistently fail .
can someone please give me some advice please ?
perhaps go and see your doctor , and see if there 's any way you can get your deadlines extended to try and ease the pressure a bit ?
send your tutors a similar email to this post ( do n't worry they 've seen it all before - some much more uncomfortable admissions too - i know as i used to work in a uni dept admin ) and they will consider mitigating circumstances .
break your work into manageable chunks .
concentrate on __quant1__ bit of work at a time ( obvs the most urgent assignment __value1__ ) .
do n't shut yourself off from your housemates , and well done for trying new things from the very beginning now keep at it !
i 'd reccomend you go and see your doctor too .
if you 've always been an anxious person you might benefit from speaking to someone ( my friend got therapy on the __name1__ for anxiety , so its really normal ) .
and try and get deadlines extended , if you 're honest i 'm sure your uni will allow it .
it 's getting hard to keep strong and keep carrying on with life .
my mum is getting divorced - she had a horrible time with my step @-@ father and her new found freedom has sent her round the bend .
she 's epileptic and a manic depressive with a huge anger problem .
she 's horrible to me , constantly .
i can n't cope with her outbursts and nasty hateful remarks when i 'm at home .
i 'm __quant1__ , a full @-@ time __value2__ former at a high pressure private school ( on a __value1__ % bursary ) and i 'm at breaking point .
i can n't do work at home , because she shouts at me .
so then my teachers get angry at me .
one minute she 's lovely , and it 's like having my mummy back , then the next , she turns into the most spiteful human alive .
i 'm not going to pass my a2 exams , i 've already accepted defeat , that this year of my life is going to make me a failure .
maybe i can come back from this , who knows . i 've got the most amazing university offers , but i can n't even accept them - i 'll never make the grades .
i wish i could wipe her out of my life - things would be so much better without her .
but then , i think i 'm just being selfish .
but surely , my life is n't meant to be like this ?
it should be so much better . b
ut i feel as if i have no control over this downhill spiral .
and i do n't know what to do .
thanks for reading .
it 's nice to vent .
you can n't get her sectioned for that .
does she even have a history of mental illness or a diagnosis ?
you do n't know for sure that you won't get good grades so accept places if you can .
life throws **** at you all the time .
if it 's not someone in your family , it 's an outsider .
i had to deal with verbal abuse from my dad for a long __quant1__ years before i came to uni and honestly , the only reason why i 'm here is because it was the only way out .
work hard if you really want out .
really sounds like you need support from somewhere else if she can n't give it to you consistently .
you could call __name1__ or something similar ?
you could go to the library on saturdays and do a good __quant1__ hours of studying there .
is there a friend 's house you could go to @- form a study group ?
so you want her sectioned cos she is a bit of a pain in the arse and you 've blamed all your problems on her ?
i know what you 're feeling .
my mum was spat out of hell too .
i highly recommend taking up smoking
oh grow up tsr and stop negging its was a joke ! !!
i think over the last year or __quant2__ __quant1__ 've become a much weaker person and in a way have dulled down my personality inorder to try and make some friends at uni .
but being overly @-@ nice to people has lead them to believe that they can say or do whatever the hell they want to me ...
they show absolutely no respect .
e.g. i 'll say hello to someone from uni and they 'll ignore me , but __quant1__ minutes later they 'll decide they want my help with some work ... and i 'll give it to them .
it 's causing alot of anger and distress in my life and is really starting to effect my concentration in uni .
has anyone got any experience in handling this sort of thing or how to go about gaining some respect again ?
just say no.
do it gradually if it 's not something you 're particularly comfortable with .
you could start with ' no , sorry but i 'm busy '
of course , do n't go over the top with it lest you go in completely the opposite direction .
if , in your mind , you 're thinking no - say it .
when they start to realise that you 're not going to bend over backwards for them , they 'll start respecting you more .
well this is such a bad attitude really , of course you can be respected if you 're nice but not to the point where you just let them do anything to you , that 's not being nice it 's being a fool .
i do n't know if anyone will read this , but i just feel desperate and feel the need to tell someone .
this __month1__ i left home , and started at university . i was incredibly anxious about doing this , but rather delayed thinking about it until i got here ! now i 'm here , and have been for over __quant1__ weeks , i feel terribly overwhelmed by it all and feel unintelligent and socially awkward .
i have been struggling emotionally for the majority of my life since moving to secondary school , although i did lose my dad at around the age of 9 and always used to blame that for my feelings . i have had __quant1__ periods of counselling in my life , over roughly __quant2__ months from __month1__ __year1__ until around __month2__ this year .
i feel at the moment like the problems in my life are incredibly overwhelming , and are making me ever more doubtful of my always low self @-@ esteem . i have no ability to concentrate on work , often find myself becoming very quiet in social occasions , and doubt myself over anything and everything .
neither of my counsellers have diagnosed me with depression , and both have suggested i do not suffer from it , but it is a huge worry to me , as depression was the cause of my dad 's death , suicide .
i have tried to solve my problems before , and have found exercise and meditation particularly useful , and have also tried things like self @-@ help books and tapes . but my general feeling , is , ' is this what my life will be ? my one chance at existance , my one chance of being a young man , i am wasting it ! ' and these feelings are beating away at me .
i simply do n't know what to do , and when i think of things to do , i never follow through with it . friends often say i 'm lazy , and i can n't disagree a lot of the time . i feel like everything anyone could do to help , people have tried , and time and time again i fail .
sorry to anyone whose read this jumbled mess , and i feel a bit like a self @-@ seeking moaner , but i truly do feel desperate .
its not uncommon for people 's existing feelings about themselves to become more intense when they are in new situations and feel the pressure to socialise with strangers and fit into new roles , i.e. being a university student .
i am not a health professional and i can only speak from personal experience which is why i strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your feelings and worries about depression .
most people feel unintelligent and awkward when they __value1__ get to uni @- you 're definitely not alone there . but i would really recommend that you get an appointment with your uni counselling services . it does n't really matter whether anyone has told you that you are depressed or not , you are obviously having some problems at the minute and could use some support @- labels are n't as important as your experiences . meditation and exercise are really helpful , so definitely try to do those . but yeah , you will have to engage with help and life in general to get somewhere @- but do n't beat yourself up about feeling unmotivated to do anything at the minute , lots of people feel like this and hopefully it will pass as you begin to feel better . being unkind to yourself will only make you feel worse @- be kind to yourself and get some help .
good luck .
i think a lot more people feel the same way as you do , but medicate themselves by using friends . whilst it probably is n't a ' solution ' as such , being around friends whilst being depressed is definitely better than being alone and being depressed . either way , if you fancy a chat , feel free to pm
if i were you id focus on an idol . someone you aspire to ( not want to be them but someone who your admire and have respect for ) e.g. someone who came from a bad background and ended up successful and happy with a family and married etc etc
focus on what you want to achieve in life , you havent stated what your studying , or indeed why .... is it because you wanted the experience ? because your mum wanted yo to go ? because u need a degree for the career you want to do ?
either way , sum up why youre there and work your bottom off to get the best grades you can , cos once you get ur degree , you wil have something you can say " hey i didnt fail , it was hard work and i passed "

i 'm pretty much non @-@ autistic ( not diagnosed with dyspraxia but i think the doctor misdiagnosed ) , but i walk on my toes nearly all of the time .
it 's more comfortable to me .
what made them decide toe @-@ walking is a sign of autism since it seems so random and is n't always indicative ?
well i might have signs of something on the autism spectrum but who does n't have __quant1__ or __quant2__ ?
you guys know what i mean .
walking on toes can be a symptom of autism .
having a headache can be a symptom of brain tumours .
feeling tired a lot can be a symptom of leukaemia .
symptoms do n't always apply but if they happen in a lot of cases ( which it clearly must do in this instance ) it 's worth noting , since otherwise nothing would ever get diagnosed .
i used to walk on my toes , but that was because i was born with strange toes that curled under and had to be straightened with surgery __quant1__ years ago .
my brother 's autistic but i have n't noticed this with him either , but the spectrum is so broad and i myself probably have mild asperger __name1__ because i have problems with communication and do n't pick up on social reactions @/@ body language .
but then i do n't have a proper diagnosis and even having some symptoms might not mean you have a certain condition .
__quant1__ walk on my toes not as much since __quant1__ of being told not to .
i have dyspraxia .
so maybe you are dyspraxic or have short tendons .
people who do dance/ gymnastics/ ballet etc have it drilled into them , to the point where i find it more comfortable now =p
i would n't read too much into random " symptoms " like that
hello , i am a __quant1__ year old girl ( __quant2__ in __quant3__ days ) who is addicted to self harming
i started when i was __quant1__ as i slit each firnger indevidually with sissors , and from that day i never stopped ,
it has got worse as i have a scar on my leg as i slit in my ex boyfriends name with stables , as i wont stop cutting unless i bleed ,
i have sevral slits on my arm ,
they healed , then i cut myself with staples i robbed from school and a razor .
when i cant find anything to cut with i take around 5 paracetmols and other drugs and i take them with larger and vodka .
as im writing this i am really tempted to cut my arm or burn myslef ,
i am addicted , when ever one heals i cut again
it think about it everyday ,
i am __quant1__ and i am already sick of my life .
the source of this is that ; when i was __quant1__ my dad left , and he doesnt want to know me anymore ,
he just cares about his new little girl and wife , his new life , where im not wanted .
my best mate died when i was __quant1__
i had a reltionship with a boy who is __quant1__ and i am forbidden to speak to him because of what happend and the age diffrience
also my mum suffers from bi polar and i have depression
i dont what to stop ,
i dont care what i do to myself , i want to do it again and again to tourture myslef , i hate me .
however , my best mate , i love him , loads , he means the world to me and if i do anything then he will ,
i dont tell him but he finds out ,
i dont want to hurt him , i dont want him to hurt himself
what do i do
thanks you for reading
are you on any drugs or getting any therapy ?
it might be an idea to talk to your school nurse or your gp and tell them what 's going on .
perhaps there 's a teacher at school who you trust and could tell .
if you tell people they can help you ,
if you keep it bottled up inside it 's likely to only get worse .
trust me , it 's better to get these things as early as possible rather than let them get even worse .
please do n't do this ,
__quant2__ 'm __quant1__ i started self harming last year , mainly cutting my arms , but __quant2__ have stopped since the last few months ,
its hard but you can do it .
i feel so much happier , but seeing the scars is both a painful reminder of how i felt at that time , how strong my feelings were that i would want to do such a thing to myself !
and , also strength , you can do it , i found salvation in poetry writing and keeping a journal ,
self harming is addictive , but you can overcome it ,
remember your self harming does not define who you are .
you can overcome it .
so i think ive got a form of __name1__ because for the past year , i 've found that everytime i go out , especially to uni , i 'm always checking my belongings to make sure i have n't lost or left anything .
i often have to check twice at __quant1__ go , then after __quant2__ seconds for some reason i cant resist checking again !
why is this ! ?
am i going crazy or something ?
it happens most often when __quant1__ 'm carrying many things , but that is rarely and even still __quant1__ 'm checking many times . and is this ocd to any extent ?
what can i do about this ?
if i do n't check , i get very very anxious , which does sort of go away after __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ mins , but often the anxiety is so much that i can n't wait that long .
i feel if i lost my wallet or phone , then i 'm doomed or so i feel .
i just wish i could go out without worrying every __quant1__ mins whether i 've left or lost something .
i really dont know what to do , and am afraid of going to the gp .
they 've probably never heard of some compulsion like this and i just dont know what to do
do any of you have a similar ' ritual '?
people would think i 'm crazy , but it 's very strangely difficult to get yourself out of this .
what advice could you give me ?
i used to do this on my way to college @-@ i had a list of items i knew i had on me and used to check compulsively on the bus .
i now have more severe anxiety and think this was just a warning sign so just try and wean yourself out of the habit while it 's relatively fresh @-@ definitely visit your doctor but also tell yourself not to keep checking these things ( easier said than done i know ) .
doctors will have seen much worse cases so do n't worry about that !
i did about __name1__ in psycology today __value1__
to get rid of it , one way could be just to avoid the compulsive act so do n't check to see whether you have lost something , just leave it ( :
even though your anxiety levels would increase for a duration , they will gradualy decrease so hopefully , overtime your __name1__ will disappear ( :
to me that just sounds like you being overly anxious , as opposed to having really bad __name1__ .
i am very obsessional to the point where __quant1__ get up 20 times __quant1__ night to check the locks in my house are all locked a particular way .
sometimes although i know they 're locked i 'm convinced they 're not .
__quant1__ think it becomes a real problem when the obsession starts to really interrupt your everyday routine .
you definitely are n't crazy though do n't worry and your gp will be understanding of the issue i 'm sure .
i go to therapy ( for other reasons also ) and they have encouraged me to pick a number of times to check , obviously that is less than 20 , and to stick to it and cut down that way .
i think the idea is to teach me , i 'm still ' okay ' if i check 5 times or 20 times .
so far i have been a lot better , i think there is definitely hope of improvement for anyone that wants it .
usually i 'm pretty calm about things and like to take things as they come and not to worry too much .
however , over the last month or __quant2__ __quant1__ 've found myself becoming really anxious about things , and i 'm not talking about a mere out of the blue feeling of nervousness .
i have begun to feel irrationally panicky about a variety of things which beforehand would n't worry me too much or even cross my mind as something to cause alarm bells to ring in my head .
i 'm not sure if it 's the change in lifestyle ( going from care @-@ free student to unemployed graduate ) that is causing this or if it 's a sign of other issues , but it 's beginning to bug me as it 's affecting my confidence and happiness .
i 've spoken to a few people about it including my parents but they all think the same : that i 'm going through a random phase and that i should hold off taking action until it is clear that it is a serious problem
so was wondering what 's the best thing to do ?
speak to a doctor about it and see if anti @-@ anxiety pills could take the edge off of things ?
see if i can speak to a counsellor ?
or should i take the advice given by the close people around me and just keep an eye on the anxiety until it becomes a problem ?
well i woudnt try to keep an eye on ur anxiety for a start because that will make u tense and more likely to become more panicky ( circle of demise there )
what i would try to do is focus on something that is garunteed to make you smile or feel happier as soon as you start to feel a bit panicky about anything .
or if u cant do that @-@ when you start to feel panicky , get one of your friends to make you laugh ( it works for me and i suffer from random panic attacks lol
this started happening to me , where i 'd just start being really anxious over tiny things , although from the sound of things , not as severely as you .
what i find helps is just talking about what is making you anxious to someone else .
perhaps not in a moany way but i found that mentioning the thing that i was worried about to my mum and seeing her react to the situation in a calm way ( like i should have been reacting ) made me feel better about it because i knew it was n't a big deal and i did n't need to be anxious about it .
however , if it gets worse , then yes , go to the doctor 's .
i have a friend who suffers from severe anxiety that can prevent her from leaving the house and doing things because she 's so worried about what can go wrong .
the doctors gave her medication and it 's made her much better .

the __name1__ distributed limited copies of the __name2__ report before a meeting on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ of the __quant1__ members of the __name2__ board .
the findings reflect an agency agreement on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ with __name1__ that __name2__ officials began publicizing the week of __day2__ __month2__ __year2__ .
the accord said that there were no remaining issues and ambiguities regarding __name1__ 's nuclear program and activities .
according to an account by __name1__ news agency the __name2__ report said the work plan is a significant step forward .
__name1__ quoted a senior __name3__ official as stating the __name2__ government 's efforts to enrich uranium had slowed .

__name1__ officials on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ stated cooperation with the __name2__ possibly to prevent a further round of international sanctions .
iran 's representative to the __name2__ __name1__ stated to __name4__ 's __name3__ that the report emphasized that there exists no sign or evidence indicating diversion of iran 's nuclear activities and that all of iran 's nuclear materials have been audited .
some nonproliferation experts stated the __name1__ was ceding too much to __name2__ .
arms @-@ control experts __name1__ and jacqueline shire of the __name3__ @-@ based __name2__ wrote in a criticism published the week of __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ that the idea of closing files violates fundamental safeguards principles and that the agreement does not specify that __name4__ officials would provide the iaea access to key people , facilities , and documents that are needed to verify iranian answers to the iaea 's questions .
independent experts stated __name1__ 's latest agreement with the __name2__ which gives inspectors access to more nuclear sites and information falls short of the __name3__ 's demand to halt the production of concentrated uranium that could potentially be used for a bomb .
__name3__ __name2__ spokesman for the __name4__ administration __name1__ stated that while the report may offer some new details or insight into the development of iran 's program __name5__ officials have not met any international obligations regarding the nuclear program .
__name1__ stated the fact that the nuclear program continues to move forward shows that the __name2__ regime is continuing on a path of defiance of the international community .
most __name1__ nonproliferation experts stated the agreement on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ contained little that could dissuade policymakers in __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ and __name5__ from moving forward with another round of __name6__ sanctions .
experts stated many of the transparency issues reportedly resolved in the agreement on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ should have been resolved previously .
executive director of nonpartisan __name2__ think tank the __name1__ daryl g. kimball stated the agreement does not address the problem that the __name3__ government is pursuing an enrichment technology and capability that could lead to the production of nuclear bomb material .
kimball stated the __name1__ government 's design is to deflect criticism and pressure and to claim that progress is being made .
__name1__ officials stated a possible reduction in collaboration with inspectors in the event of more sanctions .
the __name1__ has voted unanimously to impose sanctions against __name2__ but the penalties have been limited from __name3__ demands under __name4__ and __name5__ pressure .

the proposal may complicate the __name1__ administration 's efforts to win an exemption for __name2__ to engage in nuclear trade .
__name1__ officials convinced a key group of nations engaged in nuclear trade to adopt new guidelines allowing the international transfer of nuclear technology to states that have not signed on to nonproliferation rules .
countries including __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ that have not signed the __name4__ @-@ __name4__ are prohibited from participating in international nuclear trade which includes purchasing reactors , uranium fuel or yellowcake .
documents outlining the __name1__ proposal were distributed to the __quant1__ @-@ member __name2__ ( nsg ) in __month1__ __year1__ .
the __name1__ presentation was made in a nonpaper that allows for official deniability .
according to a letter from the chairman of the __name1__ on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ the __name2__ presentation was offered in the context of the nsg 's debate over __name3__ officials ' bid for an exemption .
among the nations that have not signed the treaty only __name1__ and __name2__ would qualify for admission to the __name3__ under the israeli proposal .
the __name1__ plan offered __quant1__ criteria for allowing nuclear trade with non @-@ treaty states .
__quant1__ criterion indicated __name1__ 's status as an undeclared nuclear weapons state and said a state should be allowed to engage in nuclear trade if the state applies stringent physical protection , control and accountancy measures to all nuclear weapons , nuclear facilities , source material and special nuclear material in the state 's territory .
the documents circulated on __name1__ in __month1__ __year1__ as the __name2__ administration worked toward an agreement with __name3__ officials .
executive director of the __name1__ in __name2__ daryl kimball stated the __name3__ document could affect the debate over __name4__ .
kimball stated --
the dynamics at the __name3__ are that officials from the countries do not want to be obstacles to __name1__ which is the largest country and the __name2__ which is the most powerful country .
consensus on __name1__ will be difficult to reach when the __name2__ meets in __month1__ __year1__ .
__name1__ 's proposal gives officials from some countries reason to suggest an alternative approach to a specific exemption .
__name2__ 's record is good and better than __name1__ 's in following international nuclear rules .
despite ties between israeli and __name3__ governments the __name1__ administration rejected the __name2__ proposal .
the proposal may complicate the __name1__ administration 's efforts to win an exemption for __name2__ to engage in nuclear trade .
president __name1__ and secretary of state __name2__ view the pact as an important part of the bush administration 's foreign policy legacy .
the deal is controversial in __name1__ and __name2__ must give approval .
delays in winning approval for the __name1__ deal could have a negative effect on the administration 's foreign policy legacy with delay until an election year having the most negative effect .
__name2__ spokesman __name1__ stated the __name3__ government views the __name4__ deal as unique and does not see the deal as a precedent for any other country including __name5__ .
spokesman for the __name1__ embassy david siegel stated the suggestion that the israeli government is demanding an exemption or linking efforts to any other issue including the __name2__ debate is grossly inaccurate .
seigel stated --
the __name1__ government has never asked the __name2__ for any exemption to nuclear supply guidelines or made any israeli @-@ specific request of the nsg .
__name1__ is recognized as a full @-@ fledged adherent to the nsg guidelines .
the __name1__ government has urged the __name2__ to consider adopting a generic , multi @-@ tiered , criteria @-@ based approach towards nuclear technology transfers .
some officials from __name1__ countries have previously suggested an approach like the __name2__ plan .
if modification of the nsg guidelines were to take place along the lines proposed by __name1__ officials the nuclear nonproliferation regime would be considerably enhanced .

an __name1__ news agency reported that __name2__ stated iran had 6000 working centrifuges but the agency subsequently removed the statement from the internet .
another __name1__ news agency stated that __name2__ referred to 100000 s of centrifuges .
experts discounted the significance of __name1__ 's claim in the absence of information on the centrifuges ' functionality .
a __name1__ diplomat in __name2__ speaking under condition of anonymity stated that the quantity of centrifuges is less important than whether the machines are operational and efficient but that __name3__ 's assertion will hinder a resolution of the diplomatic standoff between __name4__ and the west .

a high @-@ security __name1__ laboratory complex storing anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria faces loosing electricity for lack of payment to the __name2__ electric utility .
a large repository of anthrax , plague and other deadly bacteria stored in a high @-@ security __name1__ laboratory complex __quant1__ miles south of __name2__ is facing the threat of loosing electricity .
an official from the __name2__ region 's __name1__ electric utility arrived recently at the __name3__ laboratory complex and threatened to turn off the electricity for lack of payment .
the russian laboratory complex is a 90 @-@ building campus and served as the location for __name1__ 's secret biological weapons program in the __name2__ era .
an incorrect headline in the newspaper __name1__ stated that deadly viruses from a __name2__ regional depository threaten moscow .
there are no viruses at the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk .
at the state scientific center of applied microbiology there is every kind of deadly bacteria that was studied for use in the secret biological weapons program of the __name1__ .
a large virus repository is located in __name1__ .
both __name1__ and __name2__ officials have stated that it is unlikely that any public health threat would result from a power cutoff at the state scientific center of applied microbiology .
__name1__ and __name2__ officials have stated that there is enough uncertainty that they could not be positive a loss of power at the state scientific center of applied microbiology would not cause a public health threat .
general nikolai n. urakov stated by telephone that the state scientific center of applied microbiology has quite reliable systems of protection in case of emergency .
general nikolai n. urakov is the longtime director of the the state scientific center of applied microbiology .
the state scientific center of applied microbiology has been working with __name1__ scientists to convert the complex into a biomedical manufacturing site .
general nikolai n. urakov stated by telephone that the people at the state scientific center of applied microbiology are scared by this threat of a sudden shutdown of electricity because it is a kind of psychological pressure on the people at the state scientific center of applied microbiology .
general nikolai n. urakov stated by telephone that in the event of a power shutdown at the state scientific center of applied microbiology scientists must destroy all bacteriological experiments under way .
general nikolai n. urakov would like the __name1__ and __name2__ countries that have contributed about __quant1__ united states dollars to the transformation of the former bioweapons complex to contribute another __quant2__ united states dollars per year to pay the state scientific center of applied microbiology 's electric bills and arrears .
an __name1__ scientist who works closely with the state scientific center of applied microbiology stated that the __name2__ government was responsible for paying for the state scientific center of applied microbiology 's electric bills .
__name1__ aid for conversion of general nikolai n. urakov 's one time bioweapons laboratory peaked in __year1__ because it was learned that __name2__ had made offers to the state scientific center of applied microbiology to purchase its expertise .
__name1__ scientists and military leaders who now depend on __name2__ financing to destroy nuclear , chemical and biological weapons have been known to orchestrate a sense of crisis to increase financing .
__name1__ scientist randall lee beatty is working on the conversion of the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk .
beatty stated that this threat to cut electricity to the state scientific center of applied microbiology is a crisis .
randall lee beatty is a director of the __name1__ .
the __name1__ finances approximately half of general nikolai n. urakov 's budget to support about __quant1__ __name2__ biowarfare scientists and technicians .
randall lee beatty stated that it is known that the state scientific center of applied microbiology has not paid its electricity bill for __quant1__ months .
randall lee beatty stated that the state scientific center of applied microbiology is one of the important archives for dangerous pathogens in the world and it would be a shame if those archives were destroyed for not paying the electricity utility .
approximately 3000 strains of bacteria are stored at the state scientific center of applied microbiology and many of the bacteria are stored in cryogenic casks cooled with liquid nitrogen and isolated from the environment by layered enclosures and oversize air @-@ handling systems that all depend on electricity to function .
the greatest danger from a shutdown of electric power at the state scientific center of applied microbiology would be the defrosting of live germs that are currently preserved in a frozen state .
a biological warfare expert at the __name1__ named raymond zilinskas stated that the main threat from cutting power to the state scientific center of applied microbiology would be to the organisms themselves rather than that they might escape .
raymond zilinskas stated that in the worst case the bacteria would be defrosted from minus __quant1__ degrees and it would be a real mess to clean up afterward because it would not be known for certain whether all the bacteria was dead .
the confrontation between the __name1__ electric utility and the state scientific center of applied microbiology in obolensk is another example of how the basic capitalist imperative for enterprises to be self @-@ sustaining can clash in a dangerous way with the old remnants of __name2__ weapons science .
due to an overdue power bill in __year1__ the __name2__ __name1__ cut off electricity to a strategic base where nuclear missiles stood on high alert .
the nuclear missile silos themselves did not lose power .
armed troops marched to the substations and turned the power back on .
in __month1__ and __month2__ the national utility , __name1__ cut power to a number of military installations around __name2__ .
the military installations that lost power included the __name1__ monitoring center on the __name2__ peninsula .
in most cases of military installations having their electricity cut off the electricity has been quickly restored .
often investigations show that the tug of war with the utility forces the military to spend budgeted funds for electrical power instead of diverting money for other uses .
some of the budgeted funds cut at times have included the building country residences for generals .

the plan requires __quant1__ precautionary steps before the order to shoot down a plane may be issued .
prior to the policy taking effect late __month1__ a publicity campaign will notify ranchers and others of the need to file flight plans .
the law to permit such an action was originally approved in __year1__ but __year2__ @-@ __year3__ president __name1__ never put the policy into effect .
the __name1__ dissuaded __name2__ from signing the decree out of concern that the accidental downing of civilian aircraft could expose the us government and companies to lawsuits .
__month1__ the __name1__ reduced previous support for operations targeting drug @-@ running aircraft when a __name2__ jet shot down a small plane misidentified as a drug carrier and killed an american missionary and her child .

__name1__ officials have expressed hope that the policy will be endorsed by the __name2__ before going into effect .
the __name1__ is scheduled to provide __quant1__ dollars in drug and law enforcement aid to __name2__ in __year1__ .
former __name1__ chief and current director of the air institute at __name2__ in __name3__ general mauro jose miranda gandra stated that the measure was a courageous step by the government but the impact may be more political than practical because of self @-@ imposed restrictions by the __name4__ government .
__name1__ officials stated that the policy would be inapplicable against aircraft with children on board .
__name1__ stated that the limitation was necessary .
gandra stated that the provision undermines the decree 's essential purpose by granting immunity to drug @-@ smuggling aircraft carrying children and thus introducing the possibility of kidnapped children being used as human shields .
__name1__ stated in an interview in __name4__ that the government will use the law to more powerfully dissuade drug traffickers who have previously entered __name2__ airspace feeling unthreatened by the __name3__ .
the government was prompted to act due to the deteriorating public security situation with increasingly powerful and violent drug gangs in __name1__ and particularly __name2__ .
__name1__ drug gangs have more firepower than the police and have successfully attacked police stations and forced businesses and schools to close .
president __name1__ stated in a __year1__ interview with foreign correspondents --
the policy is a matter of national sovereignty and security .
some pilots of drug @-@ running aircraft felt so confidently immune from retribution as to make obscene gestures at pursuing __name1__ pilots .
the constitutionality of the law has been questioned under __name1__ 's prohibition of the death penalty as punishment for criminal acts .

__name1__ military strategists say they are increasingly concerned that radical movements inspired by __name2__ could foment such revolution .

__name1__ officials say the government is negotiating with __name2__ to buy around 24 air support and training planes .
__name1__ has insisted and even his staunchest retired military critics here agree that the purchases are essential to update old weaponry such as the military 's __quant1__ @-@ old __name3__ __name2__ rifles .
retired general fernando ochoa antich said that it is an exaggeration to say __name1__ is engaged in an arms buildup .
ochoa was defense minister in __year1__ when then @-@ lieutenant colonel __name1__ launched a failed coup .
ochoa stated that __name1__ has n't purchased arms in __quant1__ years and said and __name2__ is not aggressively buying weapons in a way that would threaten his neighbors .
ochoa said __name1__ has never bought __name2__ arms before and suggested __name3__ is doing it to become independent from the __name4__ .
ochoa asked why __name1__ is buying a caliber of rifle which is popular among subversive forces in __name2__ and stated that the political support chavez gives to radical leftist movements makes chavez a continental menace .
the __name2__ __name1__ has openly questioned what __name3__ will do with the old __name4__ rifles and whether chavez might share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in __name5__ .
the __name1__ government has provided no evidence of __name2__ arming or funding leftist insurgencies .
military analysts and specialists on the __name2__ __name1__ guerrillas say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and would not be interested in old __name3__ rifles or in assistance from __name4__ .
a __year1__ study published by the __name2__ __name1__ reported that more than half of the weapons seized from __name3__ guerrillas from __year2__ to __year3__ that had markings of foreign militaries were of __name4__ origin .
the implication was that corrupt or sympathetic members of the __name1__ military may be aiding guerrillas .
perhaps more distressing to __name1__ 's domestic opponents is the ideological training that critics say chavez has in mind for the military and for new civilian reservists .
__name1__ called earlier in __year1__ for so @-@ called revolutionary units to start preparing the public to resist a superpower aggressor and said the __value1__ step would be to train from 100000 to 2 million volunteers in the coming years to back up active @-@ duty armed forces .

__name1__ pirates who hijacked a __name2__ freighter carrying a large cargo of arms are approaching a deal for the ship 's release .
questions have emerged regarding the shipment of arms en route to __name1__ and of a possible clandestine arms deal between kenya and __name2__ .
on __day2__ __month2__ __year2__ maritime officials and associates of the __name1__ pirates who on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ hijacked a __name2__ freighter carrying a large cargo of arms stated that the pirates may soon be collecting their ransom .
after difficult negotiations likened by several people involved to bazaar @-@ style haggling the parties are close to reaching a deal in which the pirates would be paid __quant1__ of dollars and the ship freed .
a businessman in __name1__ , __name2__ named ahmed omar stated that the pirates and the ship owners have agreed on a ransom of approximately __quant1__ __name3__ dollars and the ship may be freed on __day1__ __month2__ __year2__ or __day2__ __month2__ __year2__ .
__name1__ is a notorious pirate base on the coast of __name2__ .
maritime officials in __name1__ stated that critical details have yet to be agreed upon .
__quant1__ such detail involves the pirates ' request for a guarantee that they would not be arrested or attacked by the armada of __name1__ warships currently encircling them .
a __name1__ maritime official stated anonymously that such negotiations are complex and involve more than the financial aspect .
on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ the official stated that progress is being made and the parties are approaching an agreement .
the pirates initially requested 35 million u.s. dollars and then reduced their request to __quant1__ u.s. dollars .
the pirates have consistently expressed willingness to negotiate the financial figures .
more than 25 ships have been hijacked in __year1__ off the __name1__ coast with a typical ransom of between __quant1__ and __quant2__ __name2__ dollars .
the pirates aboard the __name1__ ship have stated that upon receipt of payment in __name2__ dollars and preferably in __quant2__ dollar bills the ship , its cargo and the __quant1__ sailors on board will be released .
the original country of destination for the arms shipment aboard the __name1__ ship is being questioned .
shortly after the freighter was hijacked on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ the __name1__ government claimed that the weapons on board were being shipped for kenya 's military .
the ship was en route to __name2__ 's main port of __name1__ .
the weapons on board the ship included __quant1__ t @-@ 72 tanks , __quant2__ grenade launchers , __quant3__ anti @-@ aircraft guns and a large quantity of ammunition .
evidence has subsequently emerged that the weapons were part of a clandestine arms deal between __name1__ and the separatist region of __name2__ .
the deal would most likely have remained secret had the pirates not hijacked the ship and begun speaking to the media by satellite phone .
__name1__ officials have been adamant in denying any wrongdoing .
__name2__ diplomat in __name1__ oleh belokolos stated --
__name1__ does not supply or have plans to supply any armaments to the government of __name2__ .
all the appropriate paperwork has been validated .
__name1__ abides by all __name2__ rules and arms control agreements .
__name1__ inherited enormous stockpiles of weaponry after the collapse of the __name2__ and is now a major arms dealer .
the deal with __name1__ is considered suspicious given that __name2__ has mostly relied on the __name3__ and other __name4__ countries for its supply of heavy weapons .
__name1__ politicians were demanding answers and have called for several commissions to examine the situation .
__name1__ is an autonomous region that is currently increasing its military and that uses __name2__ @-@ designed tanks .
the __name1__ military stated that its priority is to ensure that the weapons were not unloaded from the ship and sold to __name2__ insurgents in __name3__ .
the pirates have denied interest in the weapons and claimed to have been unaware that the cargo included tanks when they hijacked the ship .
pirate spokesman sugule ali stated in an interview last week that the pirates ' sole interest in the deal is money .

the survey was issued __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ .
the __name1__ found that the result was a __value1__ percent reduction in the amount of land devoted to opium in __name2__ even though the total tonnage of opium produced dropped by just __value2__ percent .

an increasing amount is also being processed in __name1__ .
__name1__ added that insurgents have been holding significant amounts of opium .
__name1__ said the surplus is as much as __quant1__ tons , or more than twice world demand in the last __quant2__ years and threatened to devalue their stockpiles .
the __name1__ found that __name2__ produced __quant1__ tons of opium in __year1__ .
world demand was estimated at about __quant1__ tons per year .
the __name1__ this year are taking a passive stance toward cultivation and putting less pressure on __name2__ farmers to plant opium poppy .
this then supports the current price .
