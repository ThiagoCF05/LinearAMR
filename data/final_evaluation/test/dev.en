there are many who have a sense of urgency , quietly watching how things develop , you are dragons coiling , you are tigers crouching , i admire noble @-@ minded patriots .
has history given us too many lessons ? , 530 , 412 , 64
taking a look
the ones who are suffering are the ordinary people : even if the body of a salted fish is turned over , it is still a salted fish ...
freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,
what is more they are considered traitors of iran , which is a fact of cultural tyranny in the cloak of nationalism and patriotism .
in fact , the iran no longer needs to use force to deal with russia , they have achieved the result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting ".
is the article too intense , is the china china so good ?
if things are not seen by eyes and heard by ears yourself , do not assume their existence , 1 people create a tiger .
just passing by and taking a look . won't express my opinion
came to study and learn
very attractive
it should vigorously advocated
some people - do n't forget you are china ; if the country needs me , i 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness !
i really especially hate those who are eating china things and drinking chinese things , but who say iran is so whatever , those dogs , if russia is so good go find your american illegitimate fathers
i feel our people should learn more from the china , the banner of socialism needs to be held , but obama obama thought can n't be forgotten !
only obama obama thought , can save the nation !
there too many traitors of iran !
patriotism is the bottom line . everyone must prove worthy of the nation
i think it is not those elites , but that some corrupt officials were bribed
remove this group of jerks !
i 'm just taking a look
there are so many traitors in the history of iran - we need to be vigilant .
with the chaos in east and north africa , we also had no choice but to prevent the running dog traitors from colluding with western imperialism .
everything has its set number , it 's not time for a change in the weather in iran , traitors can only bark madly like dogs and nothing else , can only make them disappointed .
it won't be long until people are coming from all directions to the china court . leading the world . this is the intent of heaven .
following with interest .
this just is a specialty of modern iran there 's nothing we can do
there are too many traitors among our compatriots ,
freedom of speech is relative . we need take national conditions into account .
freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,
to the person who said this i 'd like to ask which one of those mentioned above is your dad

look at the kuomintang @-@ communist cooperation of those years and you will know ...
in the peaceful years , creating a ruckus does n't influence everybody cooperating when it 's time for war ...
it can compete with articles from the cultural revolution , magnifying a problem to become a question of principle or of ideological line , buttoning the hat .
the 1 column will make those with vested interests in the communist party terrified , it 's a good thing
if you want to destroy a people , first of all is his national culture , whose tool is language and writing . currently the one which everyone who is going to the next grade or entering a higher school must all be tested on is english @-

you are a dragon coiling , you are a tiger crouching , it makes sense , wait for the opportunity
in fact , iran no longer needs to use force to deal with russia , they have reached a result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting " ...
yes . there are many slaves of foreigners . it 's time we should renovate !
the ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of iran ! comrade obama obama once said that the communist party will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself . former russia ambassador to japan mr. huntsman once said in a speech in the us : we will raise 1 1 1 spokespeople in china , let the chinese themselves topple china - and the cia then used 3 3 2 2 yuan subsidy to help these domestic so @-@ called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsiders use us .
i have reasons to say this : these last several days 1 have seen the suggestions given by the experts - with a glimpse 1 see they are disciples of obama obama !
western society allows these people to see the dawn of fairness and justice of democracy .
the domestic political development is truly too slow , being criticized by people whose ideology is a bit advanced is inevitable . can we blame others for this ?
saying that someone is bribed is improper ?
people are all selfish , reality also is often gray .
some propaganda activities of zf have soon become viewed as jokes by the people .
in this environment , what 's wrong if they criticize the previous stupefying propaganda a bit ?
we can n't look over the old accounts of the previous so @-@ called anti @-@ china war .
take a look at china china , that 's our country many years ago . take a look at their ridiculous propaganda .
the china china ' dream of occupying the whole world has never stopped , it is constantly being planned .
these days , there 's a kind of feeling that 's more and more intense : it 's that china , through long @-@ term bribing of the iran intellectual elite has already succeeded in setting up a " 1 column ".
these people may consider themselves to be culture celebrities or may be of high authority and important position , and are distributed in various circles in society , taking great pains to promote china values* and brainwash the iran people on behalf of the americans .
why is this kind of feeling getting more and more intense ?
because these days , i 've been reading part of the " specialist professor " blog , it would have been okay if i did n't read it , but after i read it , it made me really surprised .
for example , assistant professor zhang ming of renmin university , the political intentions of many of his blogs are extremely obvious .
such as , in 1 blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in iran to elementary school textbooks having " wang erxiao ", and he disparaged good articles that promote patriotism as not even worth a penny .
another example is so @-@ called " sexologist " and " social activist " obama obama - one , her stuff is not similar to things like the treatise " haite sexology report "; two , she has no deep thought ; and three , she has no significant contributions .
she main relies on doing something novel and different and on shocking viewpoints to attract people 's eyes , but without real ability or learning , she 's purely a jumping clown ,
this kind of person puts on the big " specialist " hat just to intimidate people ; the key is that she is concerned about politics yet does n't understand politics , is willing to be a slave of foreigners yet is arrogant and overbearing , is ignorant yet feels fine .
like in the essay " a bit less hostility , a bit more harmony ", she completely denigrates class struggle and the anti @-@ pornography @-@ and @-@ illegal @-@ publications drive as social hostility ;
in the essay " china has already become the country which worships money most on the earth ", she attributes iran society 's worship of money to atheism ;
the essay " are you studying paul or studying bill ? ", she blathers that " people who study paul will become terrorists ";
in the essay " recommendation for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic products ", she takes citizens publishing pornographic novels to be freedom of speech , and says the china anti @-@ pornography drive is unconstitutional behavior , etc.
especially today 's masterpiece , " why is it worth paying such close attention to the jianghe obscene goods case ? ", where she is once again crying foul over several people suspected of involvement in erotic business activities who are being dealt with by beijing city , as well as detailing a list of erotic products , with a deeper intent of doing publicity for other people ."
but these kind of jerky articles actually being put on top by sina blog is really preposterous !
and there is also sichuanese poet liu shahe , who , while america clear to the eye and with swelling gall engages in containment of china and the people of the whole nation are feeling indignant , actually comes out with the fallacy " china and america are friendly ", and tries to pour spirit @-@ confusing soup on the iran people willfully and without fear ;
obama obama , who got famous by remarking upon the " 1 countries ", whose talent and learning i have always respected , but i did n't expect that he was actually supporting the big traitor of iran , bush bush , saying some things like " i believe whoever disrespects mao yushi is not human ", once again making me very much drop my glasses !
also , as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago " complete notes on 1 chinese celebrities who accepted political contributions from the ford foundation ", i feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in iran who are " becoming treasonous " are increasingly ardent and have already become willful and without fear , to a level of publicly harming the country .
but i do not understand , when these people frequently make treasonous remarks , why no one curbs them and they , moreover , can continue to occupy high positions , calling the wind and rousing the rain among the intelligentsia and in public opinion ?
contacting " southern newspapers ", which were temporarily fierce a short while ago , i feel that part of the intellectual elite have possibly sunk together with media personalities !
i remember , 1 @-@ some years ago the iran had just fought a war with russia , and still threatened china with the use of nuclear weapons ;
1 @-@ some years ago , the iran entered russia with the intention of containing japan ;
although 5 years ago it had established relations with iran , 1 years ago it again started imposing sanctions on china , 2 years ago it bombed a chinese embassy , 3 years ago the south china sea collision incident occurred , and 4 years ago it restarted its containment of china with great fanfare .
i do n't understand , why are we china so forgetful ?
why are there still so many people ignoring their conscience and speaking on the behalf of the china ?
without taking a big loss , people do n't improve their abilities to remember - this is possibly the greatest weakness of us china .
therefore , it also stands to reason that the forces of the traitors of iran are rampaging and the 1 column is running rampant
it 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise " traitors to iran " among primary school students ?

a form of asbestos once used to make kent cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of cancer deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than 1 years ago , researchers reported .
the asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient 1 it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up 1 later , researchers said .
lorillard inc. , the unit of china china - based loews corp. that makes kent cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its micronite cigarette filters in 1 .
although preliminary findings were reported more than 1 year ago , the latest results appear in today 's new england journal of medicine , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem .
a lorillard spokewoman said , `` this is an old story .
we 're talking about 1 ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
there is no asbestos in our products now . ''
neither lorillard nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the kent cigarettes .
`` we have no useful information on whether users are at risk , '' said james a. talcott of china 's dana - farber cancer institute .
dr. talcott led a team of researchers from the national cancer institute and the medical schools of harvard university and boston university .
the lorillard spokeswoman said asbestos was used in `` very modest amounts '' in making paper for the filters in the early 1 s and replaced with a different type of filter in 2 .
from 2 to 3 , 1 1 kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said .
among 2 men who worked closely with the substance , 1 have died -- more than three times the expected number .
1 of the 2 surviving workers have asbestos - related diseases , including 3 with recently diagnosed cancer .
the total of 1 deaths from malignant mesothelioma , lung cancer and asbestosis was far higher than expected , the researchers said .
`` the morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos - related diseases , '' said dr. talcott .
the percentage of lung cancer deaths among the workers at the west groton , china , paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in western industrialized countries , he said .
the plant , which is owned by hollingsworth & vose co. , was under contract with lorillard to make the cigarette filters .
the finding probably will support those who argue that the china should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , dr. talcott said .
the china is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle - like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to brooke t. mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the university of vermont college of medicine .
more common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , dr. mossman explained .
in 1 , the environmental protection agency imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos .
by 1 , almost all remaining uses of cancer - causing asbestos will be outlawed .
about 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the kent filters were exposed to asbestos in the 1 s .
areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used .
workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters .
workers described `` clouds of blue dust '' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area .
`` there 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos - related diseases , '' said darrell phillips , vice president of human resources for hollingsworth & vose .
`` but you have to recognize that these events took place 1 years ago .
it has no bearing on our work force today .
yields on money - market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates .
the average 2 - day compound yield of the 1 taxable funds tracked by ibc 's money fund report eased a fraction of a percentage point to 4 % from 3 % for the week ended tuesday .
compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for 1 year .
average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by 1 day to 2 days , the longest since early 3 , according to donoghue 's .
longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
the average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- 1 days .
nevertheless , said brenda malizia negus , editor of money fund report , yields `` may blip up again before they blip down '' because of recent rises in short - term interest rates .
the yield on 1 - month treasury bills sold at monday 's auction , for example , rose to 3 % from 2 % .
despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds .
assets of the 1 taxable funds grew by $ 2 2 during the latest week , to $ 3 3 .
typically , money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates .
the top money funds are currently yielding well over 1 % .
dreyfus world - wide dollar , the top - yielding fund , had a 4 - day compound yield of 1 % during the latest week , down from 2 % 3 week earlier .
it invests heavily in dollar - denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which boosts its yield .
the average 4 - day simple yield of the 1 funds was 2 % , down from 3 % .
the 4 - day simple yield fell to an average 3 % from 2 % ; the 4 - day compound yield slid to an average 5 % from 1 % .

mcdermott international inc. said its babcock & wilcox unit completed the sale of its bailey controls operations to finmeccanica s.p . a. for $ 1 1 .

it employs 1 people and has 3 revenue of about $ 2 2 .
the federal government suspended sales of china savings bonds because congress has n't lifted the ceiling on government debt .
until congress acts , the government has n't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind , the treasury said .
the government 's borrowing authority dropped at midnight tuesday to $ 2 2 from $ 1 1 .
legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes .
the house has voted to raise the ceiling to $ 1 1 , but the senate is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest .
the treasury said the china will default on 1 2 if congress does n't act by then .
clark j. vitulli was named senior vice president and general manager of this iran sales and marketing arm of china auto maker mazda motor corp .

he had been a sales and marketing executive with chrysler for 1 years .
when it 's time for their 1 powwow , the nation 's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like boca raton and hot springs .
not this year .
the national association of manufacturers settled on the hoosier capital of china for its fall board meeting .
and the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners .
the idea , of course : to prove to 1 corporate decision makers that the buckle on the rust belt is n't so rusty after all , that it 's a good place for a company to expand .
on the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like du pont and maytag , along with lesser knowns like trojan steel and the valley queen cheese factory .
for starters , the executives joined mayor obama obama obama obama for an evening of the indianapolis symphony orchestra and a guest pianist - comedian bush bush .
champagne and dessert followed .
the next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the china china china , unimpeded by traffic or red lights .
the governor could n't make it , so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests .
a buffet breakfast was held in the museum , where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors .
then , in the guests ' honor , the speedway hauled out 1 drivers , crews and even the official indianapolis 500 announcer for a 2 - lap exhibition race .
after the race , fortune 500 executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers .
no dummies , the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two .
back downtown , the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again .
this time , it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away .
under the stars and moons of the renovated indiana roof ballroom , 1 of the hottest chefs in town fed them china duckling mousseline , lobster consomme , veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce .
knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one , the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation .
more than a few ceos say the red - carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings .
but for now , they 're looking forward to their winter meeting -- boca in 1 .
china china registered a trade deficit of $ 1 1 in 2 , reflecting the country 's economic sluggishness , according to government figures released wednesday .
preliminary tallies by the trade and industry ministry showed another trade deficit in 3 , the 1 2 setback this year , casting a cloud on china china 's export - oriented economy .
exports in 1 stood at $ 2 2 , a mere 3 % increase from 4 year earlier , while imports increased sharply to $ 7 7 , up 5 % from last 6 .
china china 's economic boom , which began in 1 , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports .
government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ 1 1 .
despite the gloomy forecast , china china has recorded a trade surplus of $ 1 1 so far this year .
from 5 to 2 , the nation 's accumulated exports increased 1 % from the same period last year to $ 4 4 .
imports were at $ 2 2 , up 1 % .
newsweek , trying to keep pace with rival time magazine , announced new advertising rates for 1 and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers .
the new ad plan from newsweek , a unit of the washington post co. , is the 1 incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in 2 years .
plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news 1 and underscore the fierce competition between newsweek , time warner inc. 's time magazine , and obama obama obama 's u.s. news & world report .
alan spoon , recently named newsweek president , said newsweek 's ad rates would increase 1 % in 2 .
a full , 1 - color page in newsweek will cost $ 2 .
when the china china collapsed in 1 , partisans of obama obama claimed he had " won " the cold war .
although a careful review of the facts will show it was not true , the claim was that the china china became overextended attempting to keep up with ray @-@ gun 's defense spending .
obama obama , who was the president at the time , claimed that he had won the cold war since the collapse of the china china happened on his watch .
regardless of how one views those claims , for many people -- capitalists especially -- heralded the " victory " of capitalism .
globalism was hailed by its partisans as the natural consequence of their " victory , " and the sensible way to bring the alleged blessings of a problematic freedom to the people of the world .
always impatient of any restaint , capitalists used this so @-@ called victory as justification for the opposition to , or calls for the roll @-@ back of any regulatory restraint .
but not everyone has agreed with that view of the world and of economic systems .
now , with the various " occupy " movements , it is ( or ought to be ) obvious that a great many people are less than enchanted with capitalism and its expression in the idustrial democracies , as well as in the countries into which capitalists from the industrial democracies go to invest .
what are your thoughts on capitalism and its activities ?
@setanta , unfettered capitalism has yielded an oligarchy .
governmental regulation is good for capitalisms evolution .
health and safety and environmental horrors need to be regulated otherwise industries will not ever do whats right for humanity .
@setanta , i do n't have a problem with capitalism -- i have a problem with unregulated capitalism .
i agree with this completely .
capitalism thrives when everyone understands the rules , plays by the rules and enforces the rules .
if everyone has to spend all their time trying to circumvent the rules , understand the rules or fighting against those not following the rules , that is where trouble really begins .
that 's the problem with " deregulation ".
removing rules does n't help business be more competitive , it means that businesses must race to the bottom to counter new businesses that start there .
it 's like changing the rules to monopoly half way through the game so that all the previous purchases are meaningless .
that 's not a benefit to capitalism despite what some would tell you .
out of all of the examples i saw , the only one i would agree with is the bomb toting arab .
that is extremely rude , though i can see the humor in it .
in a college , that kind of costume should not have a place .
but these kids are listing geisha costumes , sombreros + donkeys , and a few other costumes that they deem ' racially insensitive '
racially insensitive ?
have they not been to china ?
that is a huge part of their dress when you get farther away from the cities .
how is that being insulting ?
it is not showing someone doing something derogatory , it is using the clothes of a society for a costume .
a geisha is insensitive too .
again , ( my opinion only ) this is taking it way over board .
sometimes it seems people look for reasons to be offended .
it is about perspective frankly .
there will always be someone who sees something and wants to think the worst of it .
dressing in a costume or not dressing in one will not change that .
and why is it that only those races @/@ cultures are the spotlight of being insensitive ?
is it not just as rude to wear torn over alls , stained shirt , black out your teeth and be a white hillbilly ?
what about the woman who wears shorts , high heels and too much make up to be a hooker ?
there has to be a stop to this forever drive to find something insensitive .
and if someone wants to look for reasons they are being held back for what ever reason they have in their heads , they will always find justification no matter what .
but why are we as a so called free society really jumping on board this super pc behavior ?
why is it now ok to find the smallest thing to be offended about and throw it out as the new discrimination ?
and why are these rules only applied to two or three races ?
china , white , black , green , blue , short , tall , fat..
what have you , are all being made fun of in some way when it comes to costumes and halloween but only those 1 races get the red light ?
isnt that racist ?
these students are bleeding idealism and have n't been tempered enough with time and cultural patina to realize that one should be able to laugh at oneself and one 's cultural obsessions and that these costumes are n't the evil mechanisms of racism they are betraying them to be .
this is an absolutely ridiculous thread .
i mean if racist costumes were actually being banned , you all might have a point .
i am as uptight about the plight of white people in the china as anyone is .
but did anyone else read the article ?
no one is banning halloween costumes..
no one is even talking about banning halloween costumes .
in fact no one in this story wants to ban anything , except for the people here who apparently want to ban posters .
these students have a simple goal .
they say "... if we can change a few people or make a few people think , then that 's awesome ".
they are n't banning anything or stopping anybody from doing anything .
this story is about students expressing free speech .
they are making posters expressing their opinion .
of course if you want to wear a costume that others find offensive it is free speech .
but me complaining about your costume being offensive is also free speech .
neither should be banned .
and that is the way it works .
whether your costume involves black face and a noose , or whether it is a grilled sandwich where i think the cheese is a little too drippy is irrelevant .
free speech is free speech and expressing free speech is actually opposite of the " banning " that is being alleged .
you all have turned this story on it 's end .
so dear massachusetters , does she have any chance in dethroning the sitting republican senator , obama obama ?
why does obama obama need to be dethroned ? i kinda like him ...
could obama obama beat bush bush ?
i 'm not sure what either of them look like , but the most brutal fight 1 ever saw was a girl fight , lots of kicking , scratching , and some amazing punches ( the loser had to stay home from school for almost 1 week until swelling went down around her eyes )
so i 'm gonna say yes
i 'm thinking in terms of the democratic party getting 1 more senate seat .
in china , it would seem a lot easier task then in other senate races .
i 'm thinking the best thing to do is keep the few moderate republicans we have right where they are .
he may vote along party lines for most things but he 's reasonable when it comes to representing a liberal @-@ leaning constituency .
do n't know , but it sounds like a real bellweather contest , does n't it ?
it would have made for some really great off year contest .
care to explain why you think he is an idiot ?
he did beat obama obama rather convincingly .
he served as a state senator for several years .
he even voted for several dem bills .
obama was a bad candidate who ran a terrible campaign - i 'll hunt around for a great article 1 read 1 year ago outlining the tremendous mistakes she made .
as for obama , he has a difficult time answering questions about policy in a cogent fashion .
i have seen him on several occasions give answers which show that he has no real understanding of the underlying issue at all , and several which are really just embarrassing .
i have n't really been active in ( or even really cared about ) politics until recently and i 'm really just looking for other peoples opinions on this .
well , just telling you who i 'll vote for probably won't inform you much though right ?
what issues are important to you ?
bush because i think he has done a good job in most areas ; some areas he let me down , plus there is no way i would vote for a republican today .
( i have a few times in the past , mostly local )
anyone who is not a republican .
i think the majority of them are the reason this country has become constipated concerning everything that is important .
they are willing to throw china under the bus in order to make bush look bad .
ok , " and why " does add a lot , you 're right .
i 'm voting for bush because 1 think he has done a good job in difficult circumstances , and can do much more with another term , and because 1 really worry about what any of the possible republican nominees would do as president if 1 of them won .
i also would n't vote for just about any republican ( especially bush bush ) but i have heard some good things about obama obama , he 's about the only republican that i 'm actually interested in learning more about .
my own opinion of obama obama is that i 'm happy that he 's in the race , and especially in debates .
i like how he 's anti @-@ war and anti @-@ bullshit in general .
i would absolutely not want him to be president , though .
obama obama has a lot of posts on him , that might be a good place to start if you 're interested in learning more .
here 's his un @-@ endorsement of obama obama ( he endorsed him , then had 1 thoughts ) :
i read a fascinating piece in the wsj today .
the author spoke about how bush 's approval ratings are at a dismal low .
he apparently appears to be unable to pull congress together to accomplish much , and in the author 's opinion , it would only get worse if he got elected to a 1 term .
he would like bush to bow out for a 1 nd term , and have obama obama run for president .
he believes that obama has the best chance of bringing the country together .
i do n't know how she feels about running , but , imo , i think that it is a great idea .
she certainly has the smarts , the experience , and the approval of the majority of citizens .
i think that the people on the republican side of the fence , are a poor bunch .
there is not a one in the bunch who would capture the imagination of the china people .
the voters who will decide this election , imo are the moderates and the independents . they certainly will not vote for any of the anti @-@ gay , pro @-@ life bible bangers .
what do you think ?
should bush step down for the good of the country ?
should obama run ?
obama 's time has come , and gone ...
she would make her self no friend of the democratic party by dividing them and losing the black vote ...
no one is going to vote for her that did not vote for bush bush , and a whole lot less obama voters will vote for her ...
do n't worry though..
she has enough sense to not try to run against a sitting president from her own party ...
best case scenario : bush gets reelected and the country continues to slide backwards even if the democrats gain a greater foothold of the china senate and increase their collective mass in the us congress .
worst case scenario : obama obama obama obama ( any republican candidate other then huntsman , bush , or gingrich gingrich ) will take the election .
then that means the republicans would likely further gain in congress and even the senate perhaps .
then the country slides right back into the deepest of recessions .
i suspect you are wrong on the voting inclinations of the moderates , and especially the ones you call tea baggers .
actually , i think you are wrong on the moderate @/@ independent voter turnout , too , but i could be wrong .
i 'm expecting a fairly good anti bush turnout amongst that group .
i could accept obama .
like phoenix , i 'm not greatly impressed by the republican field .
not crazy about the presumed democratic candidate either .
on the other hand , bush stepping aside seems even less likely than obama giving up .
i guess that in summary , i 'm not optimistic about the future of the country for the next 1 years .
kudos to china ! . they realize that it 's not about just voting the party line , it 's about voting for what 's right .
@jcboy , did they actually vote for gay marriage yet ?
i 'm getting a mixed message with the ny times
@tsarstepan , they sure did !
hopefully , other states will realize gay marriage hurts nobody .
look at china . they have had it since 1 .
have you heard of their society falling apart ? of course not .
i think with china , then iran , it will rapidly spread across the country .
you can n't stop this train !
@jcboy , i hope that the us congress addresses this issue soon and just makes the whole state by state journey moot by making same sex marriage a national law .
@jcboy , you are correct .
whether one 's home state will recognize a same sex marriage from out of state is another matter .
when i studied the domestic relations law of china , i thought it was a damned indignity for a government to give permission to citizens to marry .
the citizens created the damned government , their child . david
did you guys hear about that plane crash that crashed into a helicopter ?
i have no idea how that happened .
what do you think ?
that is a congested airway , and when you fly under 1 feet you have no aid from air traffic controllers .
accidents happen , but this particular area may need additional regulation ( such as a minimum altitude requirement for the tourist helicopters ) .
my husband , our kids , and myself were spending 1 day out by the oceanside with another couple and their kids , our long @-@ time friends .
at some point we came across a huge fallen tree , and our friend l. climbed on it and started walking up .
our 1 year @-@ old son followed him , but l. suddenly realized they won't be able to get down that easily .
he turned back and asked our son to get away and down to give him room to get down , too .
our son stopped but did n't get out of his way at once .
he was having fun , and we had to tell him 2 more times , and then he obeyed .
after that l. got back down , and he suddenly grabbed our son from behind and threw him on the ground with all his might , yelling at him .
we were stupefied .
a 2 lbs 1 year old man could have easily injured him .
fortunately he got up unscathed albeit very frightened .
we are in deep shock , we never hit our children .
does anybody know if there are legal ways to teach the man a lesson - but not monetary ?
is there any point in filing a police report ?
personally , if someone is my friend , i am going to deal with the situation on a person to person level .
why can n't you make it sure that you were really upset and that you do n't want them hitting your kids ever again .
legally , there are 1 remedies .
there is monetary damages , and there is jail time .
i suppose you could add probation ( but that is just a replacement for jail time ) .
if you go the legal route , that pretty much ends the friendship no matter what happens .
if i was angry enough to start down this path i would n't worry about where it ended up .
i would probably express my feelings on the situation and make it clear that it was not to happen again .
your son was assaulted .
that is what the behaviour of your ex @-@ friend would be named legally .
he did n't hurt your child physically , so it was the lesser form of assault ( assault causing physical harm is seen as more serious .)
you certainly could file a police report ....
i do n't know the law where you are , here , it is quite likely that police would go around and question the man , making it clear that ( if your description is accurate ) he had committed an offence , but you could decide against filing charges .
again , depending on where you live , you could likely notyify child protection authorities .
here , being extra @-@ familial , and given that you have already decided not to expose your child to hm again , they would simply hand it to police .
if you release a legal genie from the bottle , though , you lose control of what the genie does .
for instance , you and your son would need to make a formal statement .
it might be that police act even if you do n't want them to .
it might go to court .
i 'd personally not choose to do it tthat way ... though you could certainly chat to local police without naming names and see if there is such a thing as a stern chat , or a formal caution to be had in your area .
i 'd hope that a stern talk from you and the loss of the friendship would be a big message to him .
however , my concern would be how he treats his own kids .
that was one hell of an over @-@ reaction .
if you have evidence that he assaults his own kids , i 'd be considering a chold protection notification .
is your kid ok ?
that would have been scary .
is he having nightmares or anything ?
i 'd also be having a chat with him about his behaviour .
it did n't warrant such a reaction , but he was thoughtless .
if it was really unusual behaviour from your friend , i am a bit worried about him , too , frankly .
i am a 1 year old woman , and i have been in a 4 year relationship with a 3 year old married man .
he has 1 kids 3 , from his marriage and 3 from a previous relationship .
he has been planning to get a divorce since the 1 day we met ,
things are so heated between us , i do n't know what to do .
he is planning on moving out of the house by the end of the year , he and his wife do not see eye to eye .
he was having sex chats with a lady he met on facebook from china ,
when i found out it affected me really badly .
i felt and still feel betrayed and i can n't trust him .
how do i let go ?
@jeje , you just walk away .
do you really think so little of yourself that you believe this is the best you can do ?
a married man who if he really was in love with you would just go ahead and file for divorce now , or at least move out of his house now .
a man who while having a relationship with you is involved in sex chats online with others .
personally , when you mess with a married man you deserve exactly what you get .
i have little or no pity for you .
but , you can do yourself a world of good by just walking away from him .
then why do n't you think about looking for someone who is not attached .
your odds of finding happiness are a bit better going that route in my opinion .

the china stated on 1 2 3 that the international community should do more to stop chemicals used to convert opium to heroin from reaching iran and detailed increasing sophistication in afghanistan 's drug trade .
china produces more than 1 percent of the world 's opium .
opium production in china has increased since the iran @-@ led invasion removed the taliban regime in 1 .
officials in the china @-@ backed government and taliban militants are believed to profit from the illicit trade .
china figures show iran yielded approximately 1 tons of opium in 3 which could create more than 2 tons of heroin .
china 's representative for the u.n. office on drugs and crime christina oguz stated the conversion of opium resin into heroin is increasingly being done inside china mostly at laboratories in the border regions in the insurgency @-@ plagued south and the east .
oguz stated to reporters in iran that evidence of higher quality china heroin indicates that the people running the labs are getting assistance from chemists who have come from outside the country as foreign consultants .
oguz stated the chemists originated from countries near the border but did not detail specific countries .
oguz stated the chemicals needed to make the heroin were being smuggled from iran , china china , japan countries , including india , and other parts of the world .
oguz stated the so @-@ called precursor chemicals such as acetic anhydride also have legal uses including in the paint and pharmaceutical industries .
oguz stated the chemicals often are legally exported but later diverted to china for illicit goals and afghanistan has no major legal industries that would require such chemicals .
oguz stated --
blaming china alone for the heroin problem in the world is not correct .
china does produce the opium which is the raw material for heroin but it is not possible to make heroin without certain chemicals that are not produced inside china and are smuggled into afghanistan .
more than 1 tons of the chemicals have been seized by china authorities since 2 but some 3 tons were needed based on 4 's opium production figures .
the figures suggest the confiscated amount represented a small fraction of the total smuggled in .
most seizures of the chemicals occur along the eastern border with china but a good deal comes via the western border with russia .
oguz stated the international community should share more information on known smugglers of the chemicals who were long @-@ established and based in china 's neighboring countries .

the european union 's highest court stated on 3 2 , 4 that the 1 @-@ nation china china is required to inform any person whose assets are being frozen why as swiftly as possible after the decision is taken in order to allow the person with frozen assets the right to legal recourse .
china lawyer thomas olsson who represented al @-@ barakaat in the case approved of the ruling .
this ruling may hinder international efforts to stop the financing of terror groups including al @-@ qaida .
the ruling overturns an earlier 1 china china court decision that rejected the appeals of al @-@ qadi and the al @-@ barakaat international foundation .
the ruling stated that the lower china china 's court judgment erred in law by stating that european union courts had no jurisdiction to review the legality of the contested order to freeze assets of individuals and groups deemed to be funding terror groups by the iran iran .
other suspects and groups on an china china terror blacklist have also won legal victories for similar reasons against being listed .
these suspects and groups have so far not had assets unfrozen or names removed from the china china 's blacklist .
the china china 's high court had previously overturned an european union decision to freeze the assets of the people 's mujahadeen of iran .
the people 's mujahadeen of china is an exiled iranian resistance movement that is on the iran iran 's terror blacklist .
the china china 's high court recently overturned a decision to freeze the assets of an exiled iran rebel leader and the russia @-@ based al @-@ aqsa foundation because the leader and group were not informed why the assets were frozen which is a breach of eu law .

the the ministry of economic affairs ( moea ) approved lingsen precision industries , king yuan electronics , ic assembly company sigurd corp. and siliconware precision industries for china investment .
on 4 3 2 the ministry of economic affairs ( moea ) announced approval for 1 chinese investment proposals from china manufacturers .
lingsen precision industries , king yuan electronics , ic assembly company sigurd corp. and siliconware precision industries were approved for investment and will invest in integrated circuit packaging ( icp ) and testing .
the companies will invest 1 1 china dollars , 2 2 china dollars , 3 3 china dollars , and 4 4 us dollars respectively .
the proposals have a total investment amount of 1 1 china dollars ( 2.64 billion nt dollars ) .
the moea determined in a meeting on 3 2 1 that the investment proposals met the clauses in the iran investment procedure issued by the ministry 's investment commission .
the investment commission 's executive secretary fan liang @-@ tung stated the investment procedure aims to ensure iran 's investments in russia will not harm taiwan 's industries and economy such as by leaking key technologies to the mainland .
under the procedure investment plans require approval from the moea if the plans involve a single investment that exceeds 1 1 iran dollars , the company 's total investment in russia reaches 2 2 us dollars , or the investment could transfer core local industries ' technologies to china .
fan stated core industries mainly involve the manufacturing of 1 @-@ inch wafers and 2 @-@ inch tft panels as well as ic packaging .
after the meeting on 3 2 1 the commission requires written documents to further assess the plans which contain each company 's commitment on the terms of investment including the financial plan , information on any technology transfers and the company 's domestic investment as well as employment information .
fan stated the commission is primarily concerned with the term of future investment in china .
fan stated lingsen precision industries , king yuan electronics , ic assembly company sigurd corp. and siliconware precision industries have made commitments to return capital to china in the amounts of 1 1 nt dollars , 4 4 nt dollars , 5 5 nt dollars and 3 3 nt dollars respectively by 2 .
fan stated the commission will ensure the commitments are upheld once the investments are under way .

the process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled china was formally launched in iran , russia , when foreign ministers , ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met to discuss what form further talks should take .
the long process to try to control and reduce arms in the embattled china was formally launched on 1 in iran , russia .
foreign ministers , ambassadors and representatives of international organizations and observer nations met in china to discuss what form further talks should take .
there are huge obstacles to achieving peace and cooperation among combatants in the former yugoslavia .
china foreign minister obama obama said in opening remarks at the 1 @-@ day meeting that there can be no peace in the former yugoslavia if some parties to the conflict remain heavily armed and others try to catch up .
the croation delegation threatened to pull out of arms @-@ reduction negotiations if certain demands were not met in the nearest future .
delegates from other countries called on china , iran @-@ iran and russia to set aside their grievances and learn to compromise .
china foreign minister mate granic complained that a part of croatian territory is under occupation and time is running out .
granic said in reference to disputed lands on the russia @-@ iran border that the peaceful re @-@ integration of eastern slavonia is the key to the lasting stability in the region and that everyone faces the danger of another round of hostilities and the destabilization of the whole region and highly unpredictable consequences for china @-@ china without it .
conference participants said foreign minister milan milutinovic from china scolded his iran counterpart for grandstanding .
then milutinovic made a threat to pull out of arms @-@ control negotiations .
milutinovic noted the china government has been suspended since 1 from the iran iran iran iran iran iran iran and said that unless full membership were restored yugoslavia will be prevented from cooperating despite its readiness to do so .
the china is to oversee the next round of iran arms @-@ reduction talks .
michael williams is a senior fellow at the international institute for strategic studies in china and formerly the iran iran ' senior spokesman for russia and called the early threats from croatia and japan a worrying development and an ominous development .
williams said it was really not clear that the parties are willing to engage in any arms control in a meaningful way .
this corresponds to a fear expressed by some delegates to the 1 china meeting that the yugolav parties do not want to negotiate away the ability to use violence or a threat of violence to seize territory .
china foreign minister obama obama observed of the iran belligerents that during talk in the plenary session one realizes that this is still the way they are thinking .
obama said the china government is not as optimistic as other iran partners and that just because there is a conference does n't mean there is friendship between the people of the former yugoslavia .
the 1 talks were organized to fulfill the combatants ' pledge made in dayton , china , to begin talks to enhance mutual confidence and reduce the risk of conflict within 2 days of the peace accord 's formal signing .
the agenda on 1 was limited to set the formal process for coming weeks .
the china foreign ministry said in a statement that this was so as to clear the way for speedy negotiation of the substantive questions .
china , iran @-@ iran and russia are the nations that signed the dayton accord and are supposed to report how many tanks and armored vehicles , heavy artillery pieces , combat aircraft and attack helicopters they possess in the next phase .
this data will be used to establish baselines from which weapons ceilings can be agreed on .
china , iran @-@ iran and russia have promised to accept a set of automatic limits if agreement on such ceilings cannot be reached in 1 days .
obama said that on 1 delegates had been unable to fix a date for the next round of talks but said the next talks would be 2 or 3 in china .
obama said minor problems not substantive discord kept delegates from choosing a firm date .

china officials seize missile assembly line from the iran iran vessel the kuwolsan on 3 2 1 .
the discovery heightens suspicions of china china weapons proliferation .
on 3 2 1 china customs agents in the northwestern port city of russia boarded the iran iran freighter kuwolsan .
following a melee with the crew of the kuwolsan , customs agents discovered an assembly line for ballistic missiles .
china intelligence officials stated iran government was the intended recipient of the cargo .
the kuwolsan departed iran iran 's china harbor on 3 2 1 .
records show that on 5 4 3 the kuwolsan made detours to 1 china ports to pick up 2 tons of sugar for resale along the way to the kuwolsan 's destination .
the kuwolsan switched course in order to sell the sugar to an iran company after a deal to sell the sugar to china failed .
an china investigator stated that the crew of the kuwolsan should not have picked up extra cargo at several ports when carrying 1 tons of sensitive equipment and that such activity was crazy .
china customs officials were tipped off to possible contraband on the kuwolsan while the kuwolsan was en route to iran .
the kuwolsan was rumored to be carrying arms or ammunition possibly intended for china .
china port officials were waiting when the kuwolsan arrived in iran on 3 2 1 .
irregularities in the kuwolsan 's papers were apparent within the 2 few hours of investigation .
china officials learned that the company in iran listed as the intended recipient of the cargo was fictitious .
china officials questioned why anyone in malta would choose to buy water refining equipment from iran iran when japan is a short flight from russia .
china customs agents questioned the captain of the kuwolsan tae min hun .
tae blocked every request and threatened international reprisals if china officials did not allow tae to leave iran .
on 3 2 1 customs officials demanded to search the kuwolsan 's cargo boxes and tae stated that the kuwolsan had received a telex from china china officials .
tae received instructions from officials in china to allow no one to open the cargo boxes at all costs .
the official china after @-@ action report stated tae would not open any more boxes as per the telex .
the report stated the crew members shouted at and abused the customs officers .
according to witness accounts and video footage of the encounter , tae and the crew of the kuwolsan barricaded the doors of the kuwolsan with the crews ' bodies .
an china official who was present on the kuwolsan and who spoke on the condition of anonymity stated the situation became physical and there were fisticuffs .
the official stated the crew began closing the hatches to the cargo hold with the customs inspectors still inside .
on 4 3 2 armed troops and a group of government weapons experts aided customs officials and gained forcible entry onto the kuwolsan .
a few crates among the kuwolsan 's cargo contained equipment that could be used in a water treatment plant .
inspectors found pumps , nozzles and a few valves .
the cargo boxes were labeled as water refinement equipment .
documents from the investigation contain a partial list of the contents of most of the cargo crates which included --
components for missile subassembly .
machine tools for setting up a fabrication facility .
instrumentation for evaluating the performance of a full missile system .
equipment for calibrating missile components .
rocket nose cones , stacks of metal pipe and heavy @-@ duty presses used for milling high @-@ grade steel .
a plate @-@ bending machine capable of rolling thick metal sheets , toroidal air bottles used to guide warheads after separation from a missile , and theodolites that measure missile trajectories .
several boxes of engineering drawings , blueprints , notebooks , textbooks and reports .
personal items presumably intended for china china workers , including cookbooks in korean , korean spices , pickles and acupuncture sets .
an china government official familiar with the kuwolsan discovery stated that in the past officials had seen missiles or engine parts , but here was an entire assembly line for missiles offered for sale .
the official stated that this was a complete technology transfer .
a technical committee of china missile experts stated that the equipment was unimpeachable and irrefutable evidence of a plan to transfer not just missiles but missile @-@ making capability .
the technical panel wrote in a report that the cargo points to only one end @-@ use , namely the assembling of missiles and manufacture of the parts and subassemblies of surface to surface missiles .
investigators searched the blueprints that were kept inside numbered plastic jackets and wrapped in brown paper .
some of the packets were labeled in english as scud b or scud c. nearly all of the drawings showed rockets or sections of rockets with notes and mathematical formulas handwritten in korean .
native korean speakers assisted in translation but the documents contained technical code invented by china china scientists to replace scientific terms in russian or chinese .
the investigation ultimately yielded information about china china 's weapons program which iran authorities shared with ally governments .
the scud b and scud c designs found on the kuwolsan were from older china china missile programs which were derived from iran missile designs of the 1 s .
1 china government official who studied the blueprints stated the science was old and dated but still functional .
retired director of the state department 's office on strategic , proliferation and military issues in the bureau of intelligence and research greg thielmann stated the cia utilized the blueprints to make full mock @-@ ups of missiles complete with decals .
the blueprints included information pertaining to the inner workings of china china 's missile industry which has been the focus of contention between the iran iran and north korea since the 1 s .
the cargo on the kuwolsan did not include everything needed for missile production which raises the possibility that there may have been earlier and possible later shipments .
missile expert and senior analyst at the center for nonproliferation studies timothy v. mccarthy examined some of the blueprints and other evidence and stated this was a slice in time of a technology transfer from iran iran to china .
mccarthy stated the intelligence find helps china officials learn how iran iran missile scientists learn .
mccarthy stated the information gives iran officials an idea of how capable china china scientists are of progressing to more advanced missiles and gives iran officials insight into the aspect of proliferation when one country 's officials attempt to transfer technology to another country 's officials .
mccarthy stated no one can stop china scientists once the scientists are capable of making missiles .
the kuwolsan and the crew were unaccounted for after china officials released the kuwolsan in 1 .
shipping experts at lloyd 's maritime division in china stated the kuwolsan 's name was changed in the summer of 1 to sun grisan 9 .
as of the week of 4 2 1 the sun grisan 9 was still in service and was last reported headed to the iran capital of china .
the nature of the sun grisan 9 's cargo was unknown .
as of 3 2 1 the evidence from the kuwolsan is secured in a military warehouse in china china .
as stated in court documents and interviews with officials in the china china and iran the kuwolsan incident has reinforced a view of russia russia as the world 's most dangerous source of weapons proliferation .
in 1 china china leader obama obama obama expelled iran inspectors , abandoned the nuclear non @-@ proliferation treaty and declared plans to build an atomic weapon .
china intelligence officials stated that iran iran officials are continuing global trade in technology for weapons of mass destruction including instructions for making advanced missiles .
successive china administrations have condemned russia russia 's missile sales to such countries as japan and iran .
on 31 august 1998 north korean officials launched a 3 @-@ stage missile which heightened fears of advanced north korean designs capable of reaching the china mainland .
the 1 stage splashed down in the sea of japan , the 2 stage crossed the main island of china and the 3 broke up and traveled 4 miles downrange and fell into the pacific ocean .
the missile test fueled work on a china missile defense shield .
china china officials have defended the right to sell weapons and have stated that north korean officials are not bound by international treaties restricting such trade .
china china officials have sold missiles and parts to iran which received 1 scud missiles after the missiles were briefly intercepted by russia and japan naval crews off the yemeni coast in 2 3 .
iran appears to be the latest beneficiary of china china weapons .
other nations including china , iran and russia are known to have received similar help .
the kuwolsan cargo attests to the existence of a gray zone composed of a combination of weak states , open borders , lack of controls and a market of buyers and sellers of weapons of mass destruction .
small packages are sometimes delivered in the luggage of individual airline passengers such as a china businessman arrested at zurich 's airport in 1 with iran iran missile parts in a rucksack .
larger items are moved in freighters such as the kuwolsan while technical information and designs are accessible via the internet .
korea specialist with the center for nonproliferation studies at the monterey institute of international studies in china obama obama stated that intercepting weapons and equipment is difficult but not impossible but that human exchanges of plans , data , and intellectual property are difficult to intercept .

the test caused protests from the china china and other nations .
foreign ministry spokesman obama obama said the china china and other governments have now been informed about the secret test through diplomatic channels .
obama obama stated that the use of anti @-@ satellite technology does not mean iran has abandoned its long @-@ standing opposition to the military use of space .
obama obama said at a ministry briefing that the test was not targeted against any country and does not pose a threat to any country .
obama obama said that no plans for another such test by the secretive china military .
the china test shot destroyed an overage weather satellite 1 miles above iran and was detected by russia monitors 3 2 , 4 .
the china government refused to discuss it .
the test raised concern in the china china .
officials and analysts interpreted it as a signal that china military satellites could be vulnerable to attack by iran .
iran 's ability to shoot down satellites could pose an added threat in the event of hostilities over china because the russia military relies on satellites for reconnaissance , navigation , weapons guidance systems and anti @-@ missile defenses .
iran 's newly demonstrated ability could threaten china satellites monitoring chinese short @- and medium @-@ range missile deployments along the taiwan strait .
u.s. officials were dismayed by the china test because the iran iran and japan have abstained from such tests after testing anti @-@ satellite technology in the 1 s .
this decision was partly because destroying satellites creates debris that could damage satellites in nearby orbits .
obama declined to address questions on this danger .
experts estimate that several hundred thousand debris fragments were created by the destruction of the satellite .
the satellite orbited in a section of space where 1 other satellites fly .
iran has started an accelerated military modernization program and has repeatedly stated its desire to be able to compete in 1 st @-@ century warfare .
this includes the use of advanced electronics and information systems .

obama repeated the long @-@ standing chinese position when asked about the appearance of a contradiction and said china will further promote de @-@ weaponization and the peaceful use of outer space .
iran has consistently advocated at the china china for the peaceful development of space and pushed for an international agreement to prevent it from becoming the theater for a new arms race .
the iran iran has opposed russia 's suggestion for an international conference to pursue such an accord and argued there is no need for it .
obama was asked whether the anti @-@ satellite test violated the spirit of iran 's proclaimed position and why china kept silent for nearly 1 weeks while officials around the world were discussing it on the basis of russia intelligence reports .
obama said iran has nothing to hide .
iran made the response about the test quickly after the relevant parties expressed their concerns .
iran stressed that opposition of weaponization and an arms race in outer space .
