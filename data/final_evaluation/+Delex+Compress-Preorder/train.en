establishing models in industrial innovation
after its competitor invented the front loading washing machine , the ceo of the __name1__ im company believed that each of its employees had the ability for innovation , and formulated strategic countermeasures for innovation in the industry .
1 . establish an innovation fund with a maximum amount of __quant1__ __name1__ dollars .
2 . choose __quant1__ innovative concepts to encourage employees to conduct research and development during their work time or spare time .
3 . from among them , pick out __quant1__ for submission to an assessment committee to assess .
since the __name1__ earthquake , the starting point for construction standards in the mainland is that under an earthquake of the same magnitude , buildings should preserve their basic frame without collapsing .
however , most of the buildings in this hard @-@ hit area did not meet these requirements , with the widespread collapse of school buildings in particular arousing intense public disgust .
raising standards to in excess of __name1__ 's __quant1__ magnitude could leave authorities with some breathing space for explanation , and alleviate public anger .
according to information leaked from numerous channels , we can say for certain that before the earthquake struck , the serious earthquake risk in the __name2__ region was already well known to the __name1__ .
although current forecasting standards cannot give us an accurate prediction of the exact time , place , and strength of an earthquake , there is considerable experience accumulated both in __name1__ and overseas in predicting to within the timeframe of __quant1__ month , and the area of a province .
in regions where the earthquake risk is high , warning the public and spreading disaster prevention awareness could greatly reduce casualties during earthquakes ; this is the very minimum duty that any responsible government should undertake .
in the past the __name1__ has done a lot of these sorts of things , but on this occasion not only did nothing , but in response to queries from the public pulled out some whopping lies , playing syntax games with words like " geological disaster " and " earthquake disaster ".
i think that if our __name1__ had been able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquakes on this __name2__ mountain earthquake belt , then on that day of __month1__ __day1__ , once the __name1__ had measured the quake at a magnitude of __quant1__ , we would have been able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the earthquake disaster zone .
if the simulation program was well designed , circumstances like debris blocking roads , heavy rainfall obstructing parachute drops , power and communication outages should all have been within expectations .
instead in this instance the __name1__ headquarters emergency contingency plan obviously was not a contingency plan designed with earthquakes as the assumed condition , as the soldiers all rushed straight to __name2__ , without immediately sending out troops in the direction of badly @-@ hit areas __name3__ , __name4__ and __name6__ 's __name5__ ; only __quant1__ hours later was the full extent of the disaster area taken into consideration .
in addition , the breakdown in communication also brought a serious problem to the surface . in the past , __name1__ regiments were able to maintain contact with central headquarters by relying on just one battered radio . on this occasion though , people had no way to deal with the communication failure .
it is clear that preparations prior to the event were not constructed on the basis of an earthquake disaster simulation .
while it should have been a disaster relief command that takes overall leadership , it has suddenly come face @-@ to @-@ face with the broad base of disaster victims , directly dealing with them .
the lack or serious shortage of intermediate layers of party organizations and units between the __quant1__ has resulted in its inability to consider major issues with endless minor issues on hand , such that even if it is highly capable , it won't last long , as it will be dragged down by numerous petty things .
this would have been unimaginable during the __name1__ . a time without volunteers or mental workers , such petty things as directly dealing with average people were performed by the most primary party branches , as well as enterprises and public institutions .
as soon as the earthquake occurred , grass @-@ root organizations contacted their own people and average people also contacted their own systems or departments , in an interdependent manner .
under the centralized leadership of higher @-@ level organizations , everyone acted to make the rescue efforts very outstanding and successful , such that the __name1__ , which happened just a few years ago , was forgotten all together in the subsequent reform and opening @-@ up .
it is obvious that no social or political problems were left then , nor were sequelae that cause headaches to later generations .
during a time of prosperity and happiness , such a big earthquake suddenly struck .
many people died , much property was destroyed , it was quite clearly a great disaster .
but it was not totally without benefits , and i believe that its greatest benefit was that it served to strip off the false benevolence that composed the outer skin of the elitists , the politicians , the capitalists , and exposed once and for all the rotten cannibalistic core within .
and an additional benefit was that many people who had been deluded came to their senses .
temporarily laid aside these abstract things and avoided speaking at length , saying only a few details that left the elitists , the politicians and capitalists highly embarrassed .
the experts had just finished saying " sacrificing yourself to help others is a foolish idea ", when the leaders had no choice but to call once again for selfless devotion .
this was mere chicanery , to the point where before engaging in life @-@ saving , donation to charity , these sorts of behaviors , an idea had to be flashing through people 's minds :
am i being foolish in doing this ?
and when people saw on __name3__ those private firms manufacturing tents in __name1__ and __name2__ working overtime to produce more tents , the __value1__ idea that popped to mind __value1__ 'm afraid was probably " this time these capitalists have struck it big ! "
" why is it that these capitalists instead of those capitalists get the big order forms , surely there could n't be anything fishy involved ?
during this process , there were again talks about filing a complaint against the xinghui travel agency .
the reason for filing the complaint is that even if we owed their hourly fees , they still should fulfill their obligation on the contract they signed : driving people from __name2__ back to __name1__ .
as long as we stick to this issue , xinghui surely has no way of winning the lawsuit if it goes to court .
however , what greatly surprised me was the attitude of the student union in this appeal . they seemed very reluctant to make the contract public .
they even lied , saying that they and xinghui initially felt that signing a contract would rather make each other feel like strangers since they were both doing it for the sake of the motherland .
as you know , this type of logic absolutely won't work in __name1__ .
xinghui accepted this order of ours and deployed all the buses of other travel agencies in __name1__ .
without the guarantee from the contract signed with us , they would surely have been unable to deploy them !
in addition , there was something else that was very suspicious .
i heard from a friend at the consulate that the government took this matter very seriously and had promptly agreed to allocate funds to compensate the students who had used their own money instead that night .
yesterday afternoon i went back to check out the torch relay , but even the flame was practically impossible to see , let alone the guys carrying the torch .
there were so many people there it was frightening . some had even climbed onto the roofs of buses !
i headed straight for the center of activities , but in actual fact traffic was being controlled as early as __time1__ o'clock , and they had already started limiting the crowds entering the sports center .
some guys were really insane , banding together in groups and yelling out " go __name1__ ! "
i actually had some other classmates there , and was going to call them .
i guessed the carrying capacity of the base station towers was totally overloaded , and i could n't get through at all . i was only able to find a signal , not a chance of connecting to the internet .
only one phone call i made there got through - that was calling home .
i had a look at my call register , and out of dozens of calls dialed only one was properly connected !
sometime after __time1__ i went straight back home to watch it on tv . the spectacle was just as astonishing on tv , except that it was just one angle of the whole thing .
next time i won't be partaking in this kind of activity ! !
__name1__ 's experience of being under public condemnation underscored to a certain extent the tense relationship between the rich and poor classes in __name2__ society ;
because as __name1__ grows prosperous day by day , the gap of wealth between the successful elite and the remaining __quant1__ people is widening .
__quant1__ years ago , people had basically the same incomes , which were all deplorably meager .
however , __name1__ ( __name1__ ) shows that by __year1__ , there were a total of __quant1__ billionaires ( in u.s. dollars ) in __name3__ , with the number of people only next to that of the __name2__ .
now , __name1__ said , these responses have had effects on me .
he admitted that he was not sensitive enough to the current situation when he wrote his blog .
__name1__ noted additionally that since __name2__ currently has not yet established a sound system of social security insurance , the growing hatred of the rich is unavoidable .
on tuesday , wanke announced that it would make an additional donation of rmb __quant1__ yuan for the temporary resettlement and post @-@ disaster reconstruction in the next __quant2__ to __quant3__ years .
__name1__ , the basketball player who was hailed as a national hero thanks to his success in establishing himself in __name2__ , was also blamed after he announced his donation of rmb __quant1__ yuan because a rumor on the internet alleged he had donated __quant2__ __name3__ dollars for disaster relief of __name4__ ( hurricane ) in __year1__ .
even so , donation behavior and the treatment of donation behavior should not deviate from __quant1__ principles , namely that it is voluntary and does not seek return . otherwise , the donation loses its original meaning .
in actual fact , whether it is mcdonalds or any other foreign owned enterprises in __name1__ on the so @-@ called " international iron rooster " blacklist , they all gave generously to the cause of helping the disaster victims , exhibiting their social responsibility .
even if by comparison some companies really did n't donate a huge amount , they should not be besieged or subjected to verbal violence in the arena of public opinion .
donating , after all , is not a legal obligation that companies must carry out . urging businesses to donate apart from the force of moral considerations should not take the form of any other coercive means .
as long as a company 's source of income is legal , any compulsory payment outside of legal obligations is a kind of theft .
even in an abnormal circumstance such as disaster relief , legal order and the rights bestowed upon by law should be respected .
if we are unfortunate enough to be unable to avoid becoming a disaster victim , we can at least preserve the nobility and dignity of humanity and not turn into rabble .
the lawsuit proposed by hai ming did not have a clear subject of the right of action ; moreover it did not satisfy the legal requirement for libel .
for example , he failed to clarify whether __name1__ 's comment was an argument over opinions or an act of spreading an untruthful statement .
the malicious intent of __name1__ has not been established , either . more importantly , he has been unable to offer anything as to how to establish the damage to the __quant1__ __name2__ people .
in addition , in his complaint , it is said that __name1__ people have already expressed their displeasure through demonstrations .
here it is a country with the freedom of speech .
on the issue of libel , courts only support those who have actually suffered damages and have no other way to seek justice .
therefore , it is very hard for the government , politicians , and public figures to get legal protection on the issue of libel ,
because they have the capability to clear themselves of " smears ."
if you have already cleared your own reputation through legal protests , for example , __name1__ people are not goons and thugs , then a lawsuit is meaningless .
remember , a lawsuit for libel is only to clear your name and get compensation .
after __name2__ @-@ __name2__ put forth the " __name3__ ", due to mainland countrymen being deceived by the __name4__ 's propaganda machine , many people advocated using force to unite __name1__ .
because they have no understanding whatsoever of the situation in __name1__ and the will of the taiwan people ,
they universally exhibited extreme nationalistic sentiment .
just like the love @-@ hate fusion of nationalistic war sentiment that erupted after the __name1__ mistakenly bombed the __name2__ embassy .
they similarly did not understand the real story in __name1__ .
but __name1__ people realize that first there was the __name2__ , only after that came " new china ";
while this " two states separatist theory " has purely and simply been dreamed up by the __name1__ .
__name1__ @-@ __name1__ was doing nothing but bringing an already existing phenomenon to light .
moreover , the grand old men of the __name1__ who handed over on a silver platter a huge chunk of land in __name2__ north of the __name3__ river to __name4__ , who gave away land equivalent to __value1__ percent of national territory in northern __name5__ ; why not take this back , instead of insisting on trying to grab back a __name6__ that remains in the hands of __name7__ people ?
however , even though __name2__ people have their grumbles , the " __name1__ " has in no way triggered a sentimental attachment in hong kong people for " old china ".
i believe that our building industry here has not yet reached this level .
not only has the law not yet reached this level , but the average person 's understanding has generally not reached this level .
some officials , out of local economic considerations , by accident or design are frequently too lenient in dealing with property agents .
we all saw the damage wreaked by the __name1__ .
as to how much of this was a result of natural disaster , and how much was man @-@ made calamity , a verdict will be drawn in the end .
apparently , quality checks in the space industry are extremely rigorous , each part undergoes several inspection processes , every effort is made to ensure absolute safety .
but space ship accidents still happen from time to time .
even such technologically advanced nations as the __name1__ have experienced several instances of space flight launch or return failures .
since things can still go wrong even when they are subjected to incredibly rigorous inspections as in the space industry , then , with our current " dark " and corrupt property industry the way it is , people 's lives are even harder to place guarantees on .
once a powerful earthquake strikes , the people 's lives really do become as tiny as those of ants .
it makes one tremble even without fear .
following the __name1__ this time , there were compatriots who struggled out of the debris , wiped their tears and buried the bodies of their families , but they braced up again and declared to the world , " we are not beaten down ; we are on our feet again ; the earthquake cannot shake the staunch will of the __name2__ people ; trials and tribulations serve only to revitalize a nation ! "
this enables us to see the fighting spirits of the dauntless __name1__ nation give off a dazzling radiance among people in disaster @-@ hit areas .
the fact that these words are spoken by compatriots who have been through the disaster has given us , who could n't help our tears at the sight of their mishaps , so much comfort and encouragement . it gives us a hint that no force can beat down the __name1__ people .
however , the words later reappeared somewhere else and from someone unusual , which i thought about for a few days . __quant1__ feel , for some unknown reason , it is somewhat scary !
i just want to say , let there be no more disasters , so that __name1__ is safe and sound from now on and disasters are far away from china .
i pray to the __name2__ to open his eyes and do n't let disasters visit the __name1__ land again !
we do n't want to revitalize the nation through trials and tribulations ,
but rather we want to revitalize the nation by passing our days safe and sound !
__quant1__ important reason that a great number of people buried or trapped in debris in the __name1__ @-@ hit area were saved is that they were full of hopes and firmly believed the __name2__ would come to their rescue !
to settle victims , thousands of tents that stretched miles were soon set up , which contained public toilets , shops , and primary schools and middle schools .
tens of thousands or even millions of those displaced by the disaster have gradually had a home to shelter from the wind and rain !
if everything were put in the market , such that all the land was sold to syndicates or farm owners , then where should the government set up tents ?
do they expropriate the land on the spot ?
even the government cannot override the market !
supporting the disaster @-@ hit areas has tested our competence , while the government 's ability to rule also stood the trial !
at critical moments , the ruling foundation --- workers and farmers , showed staunch support to the government !
if everything were put in the market , such that workers and farmers would have their fates controlled by the market and no longer count on or rely on the government by walking onto a path of the so @-@ called " finding the market rather than the mayor ( government ) ," then what power would the government have ?
the post @-@ catastrophe hyperinflation as expected by foreigners has not come either !
the government has human and financial capital under control , as well as energy and resources !
for example , the value of " seizing the pleasure of the moment " also has a long history .
" sing a song when thou have wine , seize the day since life is short." some people in contemporary times think we should " satisfy and die ."
some people have gone so far on the road that they " don't know how to eat or play , "
and other take nude pictures and flaunt them online .
for another example , the pursuit of office titles and levels can also be traced back to the old days .
in ancient times there was zhou li to distinguish the order of hierarchy and nobility , constructing a pyramid @-@ like social organizational structure .
the __name1__ the __name1__ wore different clothes than others . the color of a door and the number of caldrons used for meals were all symbols to distinguish the hierarchy and nobility __name1__ people .
the aim was to settle disputes , stop fights and stabilize the society .
however , simultaneously it has also established a system that values life according to office levels , which to the contrary triggered contentions and destabilized the society .
yet no matter how many changes of dynasties there are , the value system has always been carried on .
higher or lower ranks in __name1__ were distinguished by bird and animal patterns on clothes , __name2__ used the size and color of a sedan chair as the symbol to distinguish between different ranks , and modern people use the motor vehicle displacement as a symbol to distinguish between different positions , all of which can be traced to the same origin .
i do n't care how much __name1__ wastes every time he climbs a mountain , but i do strongly despise how he talks and the way he acts during this whole thing .
after donating , he suggested that charity should not be the burden of businesses , and therefore stipulated that his company 's employee donations should not exceed __quant1__ yuan .
totally absurd logic . __name1__ 's reasoning is that making donations to charities then the burden of businesses could cause companies to fail in market competition ;
but we can see such philanthropists as __name1__ , __name2__ @-@ __name2__ , __name3__ have not affected the growth of their enterprises in any way . instead , they have actually increased the competitiveness of their companies .
and there were some netizens who hit back in the __name1__ donations issue by admonishing us for forcing donations on moral grounds .
exactly ! an excellent justification !
if you say that netizens rebuking __name1__ is forcing donations , then what kind of behavior is wang shi preventing employees from donating more than __quant1__ yuan ?
__name1__ is the economic version of a cold @-@ blooded animal , and we do n't care ,
but how come __name1__ , how come he wants to restrict what employees do or do n't do on moral grounds ?
this really is a case of one rule for some , another rule for everyone else ! !!
we see , as at __month1__ __day1__ , the __name1__ government has accepted up to __quant1__ in disaster @-@ relief donations domestically and internationally , of which __quant2__ is from domestic donors .
what we can see now are merely the name and figure of each donor constantly listed in what is like an honor roll .
yet unfortunately , we do n't have more detailed information of the whereabouts and specific uses of the donated funds .
as corruption has long been prevalent among local governments and economic auditing is not transparent enough , disaster @-@ relief funds are often appropriated , exhausted , expropriated and embezzled .
therefore , once such a huge amount of disaster @-@ relief funds from people the world and __name1__ are embezzled or otherwise partially transferred by local officials , the resulting political damage and lowering of the government 's image domestically and internationally will completely negate the positive image brought by the government 's disaster @-@ relief efforts .
if the donations are directly put in the hands of disaster @-@ hit people , it would push local prices higher , driving the already high inflation to a direction that is even harder to regulate .
it is said that our country 's earthquake forecasting is at an advanced level in the world .
but the glory of the earthquake workers did not produce good luck for the departed spirits of __name1__ .
so , we again hear expert figures emphasizing once again , " earthquake forecasts are a global challenge that so far no one has been able to solve ."
consequently , we come to realize that the academic laurels for " the success rates of predictions of impending earthquakes that have already reached almost __value1__ %" are just conditions and capital used to apply for funding , evaluate professional titles and seek remuneration , rather than a hard rationale used to reduce bloodshed and deaths .
we should offer earthquake workers our full understanding .
facing the caprice of nature , humankind is really insignificant .
furthermore , although our sense of security increases with each passing day in line with " significant advances achieved " in seismology , we cannot look to anyone to give us any promises .
because , once someone has made a promise , he would be doomed thereafter to bear this bloody weight of " being unable to effectively avoid earthquake disasters ."
and by not issuing any promises , he could actually avoid being censured .
because " there is no way to make predictions "!
humans can manufacture tanks that are much more powerful than ants , but humans cannot manufacture a living ant ...
however advanced instruments manufactured by humans are , their level of complexity cannot compare with a section of a toad 's nerve .
do not regard earthquake prediction as a " practical skill "; rather regard it as academic work in a study .
take no notice of the real results in terms of preventing earthquakes or minimizing disasters ; rather singlemindedly pursue the scientific research level embodied in " prediction success rates ."
in the course of major disaster warnings , too many disputes relating to powers and interests are entangled .
the directions of research into earthquake prevention and disaster minimization are just confined to research into the phenomenon of earthquakes , but efforts to intervene in urban construction , to formulate and supervise building standards , and perfect and improve disaster rescue mechanisms and other aspects have been neglected .... .
we have also become blindly abreast of foreign countries even in earthquake research : we do n't believe in living beings raised as part of nature ; we just believe in the instruments we ourselves manufacture .
we do n't believe the warnings sent out by nature ; we just believe the warnings emitted by instruments in laboratories .
we do n't believe in what is seen and heard with their own eyes by millions of ordinary people ; we just believe in the authoritative conclusions of experts and scholars .
__name1__ seismology is galloping down the wrong road .
real estate is only __quant1__ part of the national economy but the real estate phenomenon exists in every sector of the national economy .
the swift large @-@ scale failure and bankruptcy of collective enterprises and state @-@ owned enterprises is proof of this .
things have reached the step where the national television station has to set up a stage with the country 's military singers , high @-@ class singers , as well as top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line celebrities from all walks of life singing to folks like __name1__ for donations .
we should n't be too bothered if folks like __name1__ say something unpleasant .
a defeated general can n't claim to be brave .
in front of folks like __name2__ , the __name1__ are all defeated generals .
because the missing @-@ in @-@ action army who built new china have been beaten to a pulp by folks like __name1__ ; even if __name3__ has no earthquakes , there will be floods , as well as __name2__ , snowstorms , big freezes etc.
__name1__ is a land of many catastrophes - this has always been true and always will be .
relying on singing for donations , entertaining for one 's supper , will not solve the problem .
and time and time again asking the national television station to get out there and carry the national flag , carrying on like this in the name of the country is outrageous , it 's the __name1__ 's problem .
all the people with __quant1__ mind " as the national anthem is inspired by the foresight of " always being prepared ", designed for " advance , advance , advance , enter ! " instead of being designed for repeated begging , pleading for donations , and fund @-@ raising .
from leaders to the common people , everyone needs to keep that in mind .
when we go back to the __century1__ th century __era1__ , we find that the __century1__ th century __era1__ gave birth to the __value1__ entrepreneurs .
because the __century1__ th century __era1__ was the very time when limited liability companies were established ; the __name1__ pope of the time had such a conviction during the __century2__ th century .
are you afraid of going to hell when you die ?
yes , you are afraid - how could you not go just because you are afraid ?
donate your property to the __name1__ , show your loyalty to __name2__ and you won't go to hell ,
so a lot of rich people donated their money to the __name1__ before they died .
by the __century1__ th century __era1__ , __value1__ % of __name1__ 's territory belonged to the __name2__ ,
but their clergymen could n't manage it , and were unable to pass it on to the next generation . what could they do ?
so they set up the modern limited liability company .
how did they set it up ?
they hired professional managers to run these __name1__ enterprises ,
these professional managers were the administrators ,
and who were the proprietors of these companies ?
__name1__ .
so what did this confirm ?
the __value1__ step in separating the administration rights from ownership ,
in no way because this was a great system , but rather that this was inevitable within the __name1__ enterprises .
when forecasting earthquakes , why did it happen that only a few cases were successful while most cases were failures ?
according to this writer 's many years of research on precursory signs , the existence of precursory signs and earthquake predictions are __quant1__ issues that are both connected and mutual differentiated .
the appearance of a precursory sign does n't mean it can accurately forecast the __quant1__ elements of an earthquake , because precursory signs are extremely complicated .
there are certain differences in the categories , breadths , distribution ranges , and duration of precursory signs of different types of earthquakes in different places .
in " regional nature of precursory signs of earthquakes , " this writer divides earthquakes into __quant1__ major types according to the overall characteristics of pre @-@ earthquake signs : strike @-@ type and slip @-@ type earthquakes .
the former occurs in areas where internal fault blocks or fault lines converge but not intersect , while the latter occurs in active fault lines .
strike @-@ type earthquakes have various types of precursory signs , which are widespread , long @-@ lasting , and quite variable .
slip @-@ type earthquakes have fewer types of precursory signs , which have a smaller distribution range , shorter duration period , and smaller range of change .
in __name1__ , which is over __quant1__ kms away from the epicenter , the earthquake should not have an intensity of over 7 , or 8 at the most .
there should not be any safety problems for class a buildings like those at the airport , hospitals and schools that are designed to withstand a intensity of __quant1__ .
so most buildings in __name1__ should still be able to use after emergency assessment , and citizens may go home reassured .
if not so , an investigation should be conducted for any jerry @-@ built projects .
if large sums of money have been spent to provide protection , yet it fails to work when the earthquake comes ,
such that nobody dares to live at home , is able to use hospitals , or accesses airports , then has the money been thrown for nothing ?
probably some would say the national building criteria for earthquake resistance was enacted in recent years , and older buildings may not comply with the requirements .
however , at the same time the government enacted the earthquake resistance criteria , it required all existing buildings which did not satisfy the criteria to be reinforced and removed of dangers in a timely fashion .
thus one cannot shirk responsibilities on excuse that it is an old building .
in addition , the government also has criteria for earthquake resistance and prevention for rural buildings .
the earthquake in __name1__ stuns everyone .
elementary school buildings collapsed , and children were buried in the rubble .
middle school buildings collapsed , and young students were buried under the crumbled walls .
kindergarten buildings also collapsed , and little children 's frail bodies fell helplessly next to the crumbled walls where they closed their innocent eyes forever .
we could n't help crying at this sorrowful scene .
children are the flowers of our motherland and future of our motherland .
these flowers of life died early in a natural disaster .
natural disasters cannot be predicted , but the school buildings should not have collapsed .
why are the buildings behind the school buildings still there while the school buildings where children studied collapsed from the __value1__ floor to the __value2__ floor leaving only crumbled walls ?
children , you should n't have departed like this .
every year , all levels of __name1__ are held from local governments to the __name2__ .
deputies to the __name1__ , please make an all @-@ around inspection of school buildings in all areas and inspect whether or not the school buildings in your constituencies are up to local earthquake @-@ resistance standards , and then quickly make a proposal according to the existing problems and push each level of the government to complete rectifications and improvements within a limited time .
special legislation in the __name1__ on construction of school buildings should be proposed .
there needs to be special legal procedures for the design , materials , construction , completion , and inspection of the school buildings to ensure that top priority be given to quality and durability .
allowing all children to study safely is the sacred and bounden duty of the __name1__ .
in __month1__ __year1__ , __quant1__ year @-@ old __name1__ had already been revived once after suffering a myocardial infarction .
to get effective care for his condition , the __name1__ of the __name2__ of the __name3__ established a special treatment team , in charge of his medical treatment and care .
the __name1__ also specifically assigned people to the task of __name2__ 's medical care , taking turns with the doctors and nurses to be on constant vigil at his living quarters .
on the day of the __name1__ , i.e. __month1__ __day1__ th , those on duty at mao zedong 's quarters were __name2__ , __name3__ , and __name4__ 's confidential secretary , zhang yufeng .
in the early hours of the morning , with the clock hands pointing to __time1__ @:@ __time1__ , the ground of __name1__ suddenly started to shudder .
in __name1__ 's residence , the glass window in the foyer door rattled uncontrollably , and there was a huge bang from below like a tractor starting up , with __name1__ 's sickbed shaking non @-@ stop .......
while __name1__ was convalescing , the employees and medical staff around him were all in a state of high tension , maintaining extremely silent surroundings and atmosphere .
in normal times , apart from the talking and noise of medical instruments when the doctors revived him , not a whisper could be heard .
after the nineties , state @-@ owned engineering enterprises stopped recruiting construction workers .
but that is n't to say they stopped hiring people , but those they took in were all graduates with professional diplomas from polytechnic schools , technical colleges , and universities ; these staff all went into management .
during the early nineties , the formal employees of this enterprise still had complete working teams , such as bricklaying teams , woodwork teams , steel reinforcement teams , and machinery maintenance teams , but since they could not cope with a large volume of project tasks , they were already cooperating with some migrant worker units , in other words the familiar " contracting gangs ".
a collision occurred between tradition and reality .
due to formal working units no longer taking on young employees , working units got increasingly older and broken up .
some staff ( extremely few ) entered management .
a few exceptional former team leaders gradually became project managers .
others became materials officers , safety officers and quality control officers , etc.
those without connections became staff monitoring the construction site------similar to the security guards of today .
the workers no longer formed complete operating teams .
and at this time , migrant worker units gained an opportunity to develop .
the entire on @-@ site operation work was all carried out by contracting gangs .
working units disbanded .
the status of these workers was also changing .
the corrupt mentality that treating dinner and gift @-@ giving is necessary for getting things done is deeply rooted in the minds of people from all walks of society .
in each case of corruption , those power @-@ wielding bureaucrats , those scholars or technicians who have cornered the market in their fields , those capitalists with vast wealth , they are the ruling force of this society , and also the ones who profit from the corruption .
the powerless , pennyless working public with no access to information technology resources %pw are the ones who lose out from the corruption .
today 's society is corrupt in every direction , and the direct cause is the reinstatement of private ownership and the scrapping of the public supervision of the __name1__ era .
in privatized societies , everybody tramples over others trying to maximize their own interests .
doctors who do n't receive ' red envelopes ' have no motivation to properly cure the patient .
teachers openly ask students to give them gifts ,
gang ringleaders use cash to have the media make them out as heroes ,
capitalists trying to annex state @-@ owned property team up with scholars and academically demonstrate state @-@ owned monopolies to be the reason behind corruption , and then reap in the profits .
frequently the public , under the guidance of the mainstream media , only concern themselves with administrative and judicial corruption ; this in itself is a type of corruption .
do commodity prices have a base value worth talking about ?
do commodities have a true value ?
these are already elements of uncertainty .
with things , less is more ; sell as much as you want , as long as somebody will buy .
in fact , in a __name1__ country one cannot act in that way .
in the area of profiting from commodities , there have been no systems in place and no legal provisions ever since the reforms , there is no last word on how many multiples of cost profits are allowed to be , or what percentage .
__name1__ 's self @-@ sufficient , natural economy was not without any advantages . at least it did n't try to reap large profits off its own people ,
now the exact opposite is the case .
a home appliance - whether you are __name1__ or a foreigner , which regional category you fit in , whether you are a big city or a small city , whether you are a worker or a peasant - is always the same price .
not knowing how much profit is in there , not caring who can afford it and who can n't , these do not seem to be the principles of __name1__ .
and with farmers ' grain and rural products , if the country does n't wipe out agricultural taxes and does n't offer any subsidies , keeping on producing is a problem .
in order to improve the people 's living standards , the government set things so that grain is always the same price whether sold to big cities or to rich people .
with this kind of ratio in existence , in struggling areas trying for a comfortable life is very difficult .
this issue should attract the close attention of economists .
__month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ , __name1__ had his __value1__ th birth day , his __value2__ .
upon turning __quant1__ , __name1__ felt apparently that he was old and would die soon .
therefore , around his birthday those few years , __name1__ had always talked about life and death from time to time .
one thing he often said was : " __quant1__ and __quant2__ are ages at which you will be gone even if the king of hell does n't call you ."
also since he turned __quant1__ , people had been paying more and more attention to __name1__ 's birthday .
within the country , people dared not celebrate his birthday publicly , so they would celebrate quietly at home .
local governments dared not present gifts to __name1__ , but would convey their blessings to mao zedong in various ways .
in the __quant1__ before __name2__ passed away , his hometown __name1__ would specially send things like long life noodles on __month1__ __day1__ every year .
for this , __name1__ had accepted with pleasure , which was quite unusual .
despite microsoft 's status as the globe 's most financially endowed high @-@ tech leader , bargaining with __name1__ is something that is sure to leave you greatly disillusioned .
__name1__ 's dictionary has never contained the word " __value1__ ".
so when the __name1__ yangs hope that by bargaining they can bump up __name2__ 's purchase price , they are being very unrealistic .
__name1__ raising its price ever so slightly already represented a big concession , proving that it really does want to get its hands on __name2__ ! .
ultimately choosing to give it up was obviously a very painful decision for __name1__ .
right from the start , this was a super acquisition that lacked bite ; despite the numbers being huge , even if the acquisition was successful , truly revolutionizing the framework of the internet was simply not possible .
however , when the acquisition did fall through , it was also quite disappointing .
to us global observers watching the bustling scene , giving up the acquisition was like a play stopped abruptly halfway through , without ever getting the chance to watch the rest of the fun , and indeed there was no shortage of theatrical transformations .
we have no choice but to return back to our mundane lives , and wait for this increasingly passion @-@ destroying industry to come up with the next affair of note .
since last __month1__ , when his daughter was diagnosed with symptoms such as bloody feces and kidney stones , zhou jin has been in succession to __name1__ in __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , __name5__ , __name6__ , and more to take his daughter to hospitals for treatment , but the child 's illness has continued to improve and decline .
this __month1__ , zhou jin , working in __name1__ , took his daughter to the __name1__ children 's hospital for examination and treatment .
the results of the examination are that the upper rectum was severely infected and the right kidney expanded . the kidney stone found in previous hospital treatments was not found this time .
zhou jin said that his daughter , a little over __quant1__ years old this year , had eaten __name1__ milk powder for over __quant2__ year . last __month1__ after the bloody feces appeared , family members took his daughter to the __name2__ hospital for examination . the doctors informed them that " there is no better treatment method , just have her drink more water ."
worrying about his daughter 's illness , zhou jin asked the county hospital to issue a certificate to transfer her to another hospital , to let his daughter go to a better hospital for treatment .
the hospital medical administration department told zhou jin that issuing of the certificate to transfer to another hospital would require the approval of the __name1__ , and more than __quant1__ month would be needed .
" i went repeatedly to find the relevant health department , but they passed my case back and forth . i was helpless and could only take my daughter to the place where i work -- __name1__ , to carry out treatment ."
have to suffer this pain .
the doctor in charge told us that the kid would be out of danger if he could just urinate .
getting him to urinate could n't be more difficult !
this urine is more valuable than gold .
he did n't pee at all during the __value1__ __quant1__ or __quant2__ days in hospital .
we were all desperate at that time .
the hospital already arranged for him to undergo dialysis surgery .
and my satisfying son finally urinated .
out of danger at last , but __quant1__ trouble passed and another __quant2__ took its place , there came an acute diarrhea and fever , he was stooling several dozen times every day , you can imagine the suffering .
he had just danced a circle around the __name1__ , and encounted this problem on top of that . i was really worried he would n't pull through .
i do n't know what was happening with the injection treatment at the hospital - the more they injected him the worse the diarrhea , nothing would stop it .
after a few more days of treatment , the kid 's diarrhea was a little better and the doctors got him to do an ultrasound .
the kidney stone had been washed out by the medicine . there were no more stones on his kidneys .
the hospitalization was very expensive and our family could n't afford it , so we had no choice but to leave the hospital and go home .
on the night of dragon boat festival he passed out a stone by himself , it was a sedimentary one .
the whole family was really excited , we all thought he was better , that he was cured .
over 200 __name2__ pupils in __value1__ th primary school in __name1__ were injected , *and there were actually __name3__ students from the same schools involved*, it was shocking !
on the day of __month1__ __day1__ st alone , at the entrance of " longyuan supermarket " on __name2__ 's __name1__ , __quant1__ people were injected and sent to hospital .
on the same day , in __name2__ district , no.106 bus had just pulled up at the gaojiazhuang stop when several people were injected , soon , the __name1__ assailants jumped from the bus and fled , but they were soon detained after bystanders gave chase .
the 920 and many other buses also experienced a number of poisoned syringe cases .
on __month1__ __day1__ , the no. 17 bus exploded near xibei road , while the no. 14 bus was bombed at the same time .
nevertheless , all news was blocked .
but witnesses shortly after spread the news to the outside world by telephone - __name1__ security is extremely deteriorating !
even more ironic was in late __month1__ , when *president __name1__ jintao* had just visited __name2__ on an inspection tour . upon his return to __name4__ , the situation in __name3__ was far from settling , instead the *uyghur terrorists* becoming even more rampant , and the numbers of attacks and bombings were increasing rather than decreasing !
the incompetence of the __name1__ government would make the central extremely troublesome !
listening to __name1__ by __name2__ , seeing the photograph album in which photos showing collages of compatriots receiving awards , i do n't know when people should cry , and my heart is lost .
after so many years can they still sing __name1__ ?
dear friends , let me fill in some of the words for the melody right now in my heart .
do n't worry , the cold @-@ blood is n't me , it 's a part of my heart .
if an __name1__ were held taking the damage done to mankind by industrial pollution as theme , i think our dear motherland should be able to win a gold medal and a champion of winning the grand total in gold medals . i just do n't know how the opening ceremony would be run , how volunteers should be recruited , or which song should be sung lustily .
the title of the sick man of __name1__ once went far away following the revolutionary course brimming with victories , but after seeing this group of photos , i feel that they have whistled back with this brand new attitude of faster , higher , stronger .
what is different is that i dare not expect for ; in what way can we have again " the destruction of opium at __name1__ " with " upholding the country 's interests with one 's life ".
because we and our motherland cannot depart from this shocking pollution . what we can do is just to improve , adjust and vaguely hope .
the people who have been sacrificed have , without choice , used their lives to pave the road to success for another group of people .
at that time , tens of thousands of city youth headed to the countryside , but by no means were all of them were true believers .
some were under pressure to show their " revolutionary zeal ", others went because there were no jobs in the city .
the poverty and backwardness of the countryside were appalling , and most of the educated youth became disillusioned .
in the middle of the __decade1__ 's the intensity of the __name1__ waned , and one after one the youths returned to the cities or went to study in university , but back then there was n't an exam to get into university , it depended on your political background and behavior .
__name1__ was not one of these . he worked for __quant1__ years in a rural part of __name2__ , became a village head , and was very popular with the locals .
he was a dab hand at working the fields , and could match the locals when it came to drinking spirits .
he married an old school friend of his from __name1__ , and she stayed behind for him , the two living their own little lives together in the country .
although the villagers had no interest in the various kinds of " revolutionary practices " that __name1__ tried to make them adopt , he was honest and kind , and his generous personality won their friendship and affection .
after __name2__ had returned to __name3__ for not even a few moths , the student movement in __name1__ began .
__name1__ went to the square to listen to speeches and singing , and watched a new generation of students be rebellious , and was shaken and moved .
__quant1__ years before , the god of the " __name1__ " was __name2__ , but the ideal of young people now was wearing jeans and a t @-@ shirt , and a new statue had been erected : lady liberty .
at that time __quant1__ lived in __name1__ , and every day went to the square . when we ran into each other , __name2__ did n't say much . however it looked like he had a __quant2__ thoughts stirring in his heart .
one afternoon , i went to see an active figure in the square , and arranged to go together with him .
friends greeted me with smiles , and asked me to go into their tent , as a meeting of student leaders was going on inside .
jianguo was just behind me and had just started to come inside , when my friends frowned and stopped him : " no , you can n't come inside ! "
i explained , saying this was my brother . my friends listened with surprise .
__name2__ @-@ born and __name2__ @-@ raised __name1__ , he looked today completely like a villager from the countryside .
wang peirong thinks that this is related to blockages in the usual reporting channels .
he pointed out , all of his reports were made under the circumstances that the normal reports did n't work , and he had no choice but made reports online .
a typical example is that the fall of dong feng , the most debaucherous secretary labeled as __quant1__ @-@ husband @-@ with @-@ __quant2__ @-@ wife in the country .
wang peirong thinks that dong feng 's absurdity and corruption was actually an open secret , but nobody investigated and penalized ; and even though wang peirong reported on this using his real name to the concerned departments for __quant1__ year , no __quant1__ bothered to inquire about it .
wang peirong also thinks that reporting online is equivalent to publicizing the corruptive deeds of the person being reported against . once under the public eye , the possibility of any blatant cover @-@ ups becomes greatly reduced , thus , making it easier to investigate and penalize .
many people will ask , chargeback rival is made by an individual , so what is the relationship with __name1__ ?
there are likely __quant1__ original reasons why __name1__ uses a person 's name to issue chargeback rival :
general manager zhou has done too much bad stuff on pc 's , and did n't want to offend too many people on cell phones , so he found an individual author to act as a scapegoat ( if a cell phone sp company knew that it was __name1__ that block their way . each one of them is tough.) ;
using an individual author to issue it , it was easy to defraud the grassroots netizens of their sense of identification and sympathy .
if you see i am an individual netizen , who has been charged money , so makes a piece of software in order to help everyone solve this problem , then how moved it seems from the outside .
using an individual author to issue , there has been a strong power of captivation . many companies in the sp and wireless realm would definitely think that a product from an individual author would not have much influence , so would not pay too much attention to it .
nevertheless , __name1__ already did this under cover of promoting chargeback rival in large scale . once after chargeback rival became dominant on the situation , then it is to be transformed into __name2__ .
having seen no hope from __name1__ , wang peirong then could only post the relevant problems online .
not only that , wang peirong 's generous and courageous endeavors have led to revenge from the reported on numerous occasions : when reporting the corruption of li rongqi , he was severely beaten up by hired goons ; when reporting the black forces , he was retaliated by the black forces , and hospitalized for the injuries .
but these have not been able to halt the momentum of wang peirong 's reporting .
however , in the program , wang peirong calls out to the parties and the government to set out policies and provisions to protect the personal safety and legal rights of whistle blowers .
this program of <<news night banquet>> on __name1__ 's city channel , caused a great uproar in the community .
but in contrast with this , wang peirong , well reputed as __name1__ 's " __value1__ person in online anti @-@ corruption ", is now suffering unfair treatment .
because of pressure from the reported officials such as li rongqi , __name1__ has suspended wang peirong 's teaching duties .
how __name1__ responds to __name2__ mainstream media 's positive and active appraisal of wang peirong ; how well they treat wang peirong ; and how they protect wang peirong 's legal rights , are unavoidable questions placed in front of the mining university 's decision makers .
the __name1__ defense budget for __year1__ is rmb 670.274 billion , increasing by rmb 67.604 billion and __value1__ % compared to the previous year 's estimated budgetary expenditure .
the __name1__ military expenditures are increasing too fast for __name2__ , and the increase is currently over rmb __quant1__ , but what on earth can china do with this additional amount of more than rmb __quant2__ dollars ?
based on the current exchange rate between the renminbi and __name2__ dollar , it amounts to more than __name2__ $ __quant1__ , which can purchase more than a hundred of the latest 3.5 generation __name1__ fighter planes .
if it is used to manufacture __name2__ __name1__ @-@ __name1__ fighters , over two hundred planes can be produced , or perhaps even more . in __quant1__ go , __name3__ can improve its prowess in the air by a margin even greater than the total sum of a mid @-@ sized __name4__ country .
in fact , what america really fears is not the increase of military expenditure , but rather the rapid rate at which __name1__ is upgrading its military technologies , which may enable __name1__ to overtake america soon .
compared to __name2__ , __name1__ has many inadequacies , for instance , its high technology development is not as mature as __name2__ 's , and its basic infrastructure , the standard of education of its citizens , development of its systems and so on are also lacking . however , __name3__ has its own natural advantages , and that is china possesses a long history and stability of culture .
some people pointed out in their comments that this is a serious disadvantage to __name1__ when compared to __name2__ , as they say that china is carrying too heavy a burden which will hinder rapid development ,
in fact , this reasoning is extremely incorrect , the __name1__ culture is profound , so whatever problems the country may face , it can draw on its historic experiences ,
for instance , when __name2__ deals with international affairs , it can learn from how the __name1__ handled foreign trade and the problems of co @-@ existence between multiple ethnic groups , or it could at least draw a lesson from the negative experiences .
currently __name1__ is drastically cutting down on its military expenditure , however it fears that __name2__ will substantially increase its military expenditure . __name3__ is desperately attempting to return to the __name4__ as it wishes to continue to contain the growth of __name5__ military strength ,
__name1__ controls the __name2__ , and a large majority of __name3__ 's shipping vessels are under its control . however if __name4__ wishes to maintain the development of world trade order , its expenses will naturally be enormous .
if it were not for the financial crisis , a number of __name1__ countries have stated that they would not have considered budgetary issues for __name2__ military deployments .
as a matter of fact , neighboring countries need not be too sensitive to the sharp increase in __name1__ military spending . they fear that __name2__ will pose a direct threat to them , but chinese history has shown that china has never had the habit of wielding its military might to challenge __name3__ countries , but as for how they habitually view china will depend on the profound influence of the chinese culture .
__name1__ does not like to show off , preferring to restrain itself , and the same is true in the field of military matters .
up to now , __name1__ revealed that it has __quant1__ models of the __value1__ th generation stealth fighter planes under research and development , and the __name2__ is expected to enter mass production and service next year , which is a direct blow to __name3__ ,
however , what is even more terrifying for __name2__ is that this __name1__ fighter plane model has already displayed surprisingly advanced performance during combat , and it is feared that its level of technological advancement cannot be matched by the __name3__ . after all , this model of fighter plane has never participated in actual inspections up to this point .
perhaps this is understandable for __name1__ , but it is inevitable that the __value1__ th generation chinese fighter plane would create a stir .
the original order has been disrupted . after all , the __name1__ fighter is no less powerful than the __name2__ one .
according to __name1__ media reports , __name2__ 's military expenditures are expected to reach __name1__ $ __quant1__ in __quant2__ years ' time ,
of course there is a strong possibility that this number has been greatly exaggerated , and it is also embellished by the china threat theory . however , such moves by __name1__ no longer has much effect on china , even if the chinese defense expenditures reach __name2__ $ __quant1__ , america cannot do anything to china ,
recently , __name1__ adopted an aggressive stance , casting negative votes on the __name2__ issue three times , and in relation to __name4__ 's naming of the __name5__ , __name3__ appears to be sending a message that ' we have accumulated sufficient power , and we are not afraid of your distortions of the truth .'
the __name1__ military expenditures are soaring . by contrast , __name2__ is continuously cutting down on its military expenditures , repeatedly asserting that its prowess will be replaced by small but elite troops that will not affect its capabilities . as it is nothing more than self @-@ consolation , therefore , it caused widespread concern throughout __name3__ .
certainly , this is clearly a refurbished version of the ' military threat theory ' from __name1__ , and it is now changed to a ' threat by military expenditure theory ', however , __name2__ is used to finger @-@ wagging and criticism from __name1__ , and as __name2__ grows increasingly confident , this writer believes that america will terminate its friendly economic relations with china soon or later ,
__name1__ 's soaring military expenditures imply that china is reluctant to be limited to a position as the world 's no. __value1__ , and nor is it content to be world no. __value2__ in name only . instead , it intends to recover its historical __quant1__ @-@ year glory as the leader of the world .
the content is not quite the same as the title ...
let me whisper this : doing business in __name1__ depends on connections , and red packets are also accepted~same as in __name2__ ... :)
faced with rascals and hooligans like the __name2__ , the __name1__ have no choice but to arm themselves .
indeed . i wonder what our military expenditure is like in proportion to __name1__ 's , and besides how much of our military expenditure is genuinely spent on sophisticated national defenses , if it is really spent on advanced defenses , there will never be such a thing as too much ! compared to __name2__ we are still lagging far behind !
now that vice president __name3__ has visited __name2__ , the direction for the __name1__ @-@ american relationship has become the focus of world attention .
but no matter how sweetly imperialist america talks , i have no hope for imperialist __name1__ .
imperialist __name1__ has always been a country failing to live up to its words , and as long as something is in its interests , it will spare no effort and use any means to get it .
the relationship between __name1__ and imperialist __name2__ is like that between the sheep and the wolf , and do n't expect the wolf to change its ambition ,
the wolf and the sheep can never be friends , even if so , it 's only an illusion on our part , it 's only a wolf in sheep 's clothing .
ultimately , it will reveal its wolf nature , and i hope the sheep will not be fooled by it .
the whole world expects __name1__ and __name2__ to coexist peacefully , jointly preside over and deal with international affairs , and build a peaceful new international order .
the peaceful coexistence of __name1__ and __name2__ is also the common wish of the people in the two countries .
nevertheless , the peace we aspire to will be only our good wish .
__name1__ is the fallen petals that have the intention , but imperialist __name2__ is the heartless flowing water .
maintaining friendly relations with imperialist __name2__ is only the wishful thinking of some __name1__ !
though there is a great distance between __name1__ and __name2__ and there are no territorial disputes , unlike our relationship with the __name3__ , there is a direct conflict of interest .
however , due to ideological difference between china and __name1__ and the lack of the necessary trust and communication in handling international affairs , it is particularly imperialist __name1__ , in its effort to contain the development of china and its threat to its hegemonic position , that makes trouble wherever possible to constrain the takeoff of the __name2__ dragon .
actually , imperialist __name1__ has the initiative in terms of whether the __quant1__ major countries , __name2__ and america can get along ,
__name1__ has done a __quant1__ , and sacrificed a __quant1__ , for the sino @-@ __name2__ relationship ,
out of its wishful thinking , china uses its warm face to caress the cold ass of imperialist __name2__ , but it is still unable to win imperialistic america 's sincerity , causing the __name1__ @-@ american relationship to waver and even fall backwards .
in future times , as __name1__ challenges its world hegemony and imperialist __name2__ attempts to retain it , more clashes will happen , conflicts will be inevitable , and the struggle will become ever more ferocious .
in recent years , as __name1__ 's reform and opening @-@ up campaign has reached greater depths , the people 's living standards have improved substantially , and its defense and military strength has also developed rapidly .
the status of __name1__ as a major world power has begun to be more prominent , and in dealing with and directing international affairs , china has played an ever more important role .
__name1__ 's rapid growth and rise has gradually threatened and challenged the hegemonic position of imperialist __name2__ .
this makes imperialist __name1__ restless , and it has devised every possible means to contain and check __name2__ 's development .
imperialist __name1__ wants to upset and restrain __name2__ with its military sales to __name3__ and the __name3__ issue !
the __name1__ issue has become an everlasting sorrow in the hearts of all descendants of __name2__ .
imperialist __name1__ wants to control the __name2__ and suppress __name3__ and __name4__ mainly because it covets the important strategic location and abundant resources of the middle east .
imperialist __name1__ wants to overthrow the __name2__ regime to get rid of the __name3__ 's only military base in the __name4__ ! it does not want the influence of the __name5__ to exist in the __name6__ region over the long term .
imperialist __name1__ wants to topple __name2__ mainly to take on china , to control china 's resources and contain __name3__ 's development .
in addition , it also wants to suppress the __name1__ and squeeze the living space of __name2__ and __name3__ .
in today 's world , the only countries that can constitute a threat to the hegemonic position of imperialist __name2__ are __name1__ and , to a lesser degree , the __name3__ .
imperialist __name1__ has had far @-@ reaching strategic foresight , and each step it takes serves to consolidate its hegemony .
imperialist __name1__ is suppressing __name2__ in an all @-@ round way , and we can see imperialist america 's meddling presence in the economy , politics and military affairs .
imperialist __name1__ has been supporting little __name2__ , __name3__ , the __name4__ servants and the __name5__ monkeys , disturbing the stable environment around __name6__ to disrupt the peaceful development and rise of china .
imperialist __name1__ is now pompously returning to the __name3__ region and reshuffling its military deployment , directly targeting __name2__ .
__name1__ is the deepest pain for all __name2__ , because imperialist __name3__ has long taken taiwan as a pawn and used it as a bargaining chip in the struggle with china .
it 's a pity that many __name1__ are still hoping to make friends with imperialist america and maintain a friendship with imperialist america from generation to generation .
furthermore , the many strategic adjustments and ideas of imperialist __name1__ are all aimed at the rising __name2__ .
many advanced weapons have been tailor @-@ made for __name1__ .
compatriots ! wake up ! imperialist __name1__ has already aimed its guns to our heads , do not keep daydreaming !
imperialist __name1__ takes __name2__ as its prime rival and enemy , give up your fantasy that you can make friends with the enemy !
the best method is to make good use of our time to step up our own defense and military construction , cast away all the illusions , and get ready for war !
our ancestors wisely said , " harbor no ill intention against others , but never relax one 's vigilance "!
this is the necessary psychology for getting along with friends , but at this moment imperialist __name1__ is our enemy staring like a tiger watching its prey , making it more necessary for us to remain vigilant at this time !
__name1__ has made a lot of sacrifices to improve its relations with imperialist __name2__ , and china has all along tried to become friends with imperialist america ,
although __name1__ now needs a peaceful and stable environment for its development , we can n't make continual investments without any return .
can __name1__ @-@ __name2__ relations be improved ? is friendly development possible ? the key question lies with imperialist __name3__ , not __name4__ .
imperialist __name1__ has always held the initiative in the development of __name2__ @-@ american relations .
in fact , it is not difficult for __name1__ and __name2__ to become friends , because __name1__ and __name2__ , despite their ideological differences , have no land or territorial disputes .
though china and america have fought each other on the battlefield , the wars were not directly between __name1__ and __name2__ .
if imperialist __name1__ sincerely wants to make friends with china , it must display its sincerity and let the __name2__ people see actual actions and results .
for __name1__ , the greatest interest concerning imperialist __name3__ lies in the __name2__ issue .
if imperialist __name1__ can stop its military sales to __name3__ , provide no support to taiwan , and ensure peace across the __name4__ , it will allow __name2__ to accomplish its great cause of national reunification .
if it refrains from meddling in china 's internal human rights issues , and also does not intervene in other affairs such as __name3__ , i believe that __name1__ will also sacrifice its other interests to reciprocate the good faith of imperialist __name2__ !
only if imperialist america does this can __name2__ and __name1__ truly become friends and co @-@ exist peacefully as friends from generation to generation .
will imperialist __name1__ give up __name2__ ? absolutely not !
being used to being a hegemon , imperialist __name1__ likes to intervene in the internal affairs and human rights affairs of other countries , and __name2__ is the best chess piece for containing __name3__ , so i believe imperialist america will not easily let go of it !
there is even less possibility that it will tolerate a __name1__ challenge to its position as the world hegemon !
in the years to come , instead of becoming friends , __name1__ and __name2__ will only become rivals and even enemies !
therefore , it 's unnecessary to harbor any fantasies about imperialist __name3__ , __name2__ should fundamentally change its mentality , there is no need to fear imperialist america , and we should be ready for a military confrontations with imperialist __name3__ at any time .
let 's win the respect of imperialist __name1__ and the whole world with our strength .
a peaceful rise is only our unilateral notion , because the big powers of the world will not accept the appearance of a powerful __name1__ .
only baptized by war can __name1__ really become a world power .
the __name1__ should be ever vigilant and not be deceived by the present peace , active war preparation is the only right choice ,
only when our defense and military have become strong , will we be able to eradicate all aggressors , and only through the baptism of war can __name1__ become a truly powerful country .
in my personal opinion , there must be a war between __name1__ and __name2__ in the future !
what __name1__ needs to do is to cast away its illusions and get ready for war .
__name2__ __name1__ is no doubt a monopolized operator in __name2__ , the biggest mobile phone market in the world . it has also expressed clearly its ambition to step outside the country and participate in global competitions .
even though the performances of __name2__ companies are not outstanding in the course of globalization , wang jianzhou , president and ceo of __name1__ , is determined to change all this .
on the eve of the business week ceo forum held in __name3__ on __month1__ __day1__ , __name2__ gave an exclusive interview to the editor of the __name1__ .
he stated that the objective of __name1__ is to become a world @-@ class company .
__name1__ , __quant1__ , said in fluent __name6__ that __name5__ __name2__ , which is listed on the __name3__ , has close to __quant2__ mobile phone users in mainland __name5__ , an equivalent of the entire population of the __name4__ .
this signifies that __name1__ occupies almost __value1__ percent of the market share in mainland __name2__ .
__name1__ , __name2__ , shen nanpeng , __name3__ ...
in the past __quant1__ years , behind these __name3__ high @-@ tech magnates who emerged one after another was sure to be the shadow of the __name2__ owned __name1__ ( idg ) .
the __quant1__ idg conference was held in __name1__ , __name2__ on __month1__ __day1__ .
apart from the __quant1__ partners , who are called the ' __quant1__ swords ' inside idg , the participants also included over 190 ceos of companies that __name1__ invested in and representatives from investment banks and consulting agencies .
according to the practice of the past __quant1__ years , after each idg conference , there will always be some participants who make the list of magnates of the year .
i insisted on not paying him . finally , he cracked and fled in panic .
however , i was also at the verge of collapse because the people 's police at 110 whom i looked forward to still had not arrived yet .
these days , overseas study has become popular . to friends and relatives , it 's a proud thing to be mentioned .
children of the rich and government officials , who does n't want to enhance their status through overseas study ?
let alone that getting oneself a __name1__ diploma will make getting a good job easier in the future . even old dad and mom making a parade of it everywhere would look exceedingly good !
however , those in middle class families or even laid @-@ off workers see those children of the wealthy and powerful go overseas , come back cloaked in glory and all have a good future ( they do n't know that family wealth and good backgrounds of those are the only real guarantees ) . how wonderful ! thereupon , they pinch and scrape to send their child overseas ,
it seems that once they are sent overseas , nothing but a wonderful future and unlimited glory will return .
nowadays , it is more often the case that those who do n't pass the university entrance exam and are wasting their days at home without doing anything are sent overseas . with a bit of " toughening up ", everything will be okay .
wrong ! with a huge chunk of cash spent , the frightening thing is that the payoff falls far short of expectations .
even more frightening is that it holds the child back .
__quant1__ 've been in __name1__ for several years !
what i have experienced myself or , even more , what __quant1__ have seen are the countless who have given up their studies year by year , those with wrecked health everywhere , those who sold their souls and even those who lost their lives .
overseas study is a splendid term , but in return it demands youth , effort and staunch perseverance , as well as sufficient rationality .
life is never a bed of roses in any location , even more in a foreign land where there is a language barrier , different customs and no family or friends .
malformed society
the proposal on " the transfer of reproduction rights " is originate from the same track the proposal on " controlling the number of rural children going to college "! what else are these representatives if not do @-@ nothing politicians ?
fuck you ! go to hell ! fuck your mother !
complete and obvious bullshit ! more sinister than directly selling and buying infants !
can __name1__ still be saved ?
the __quant1__ @-@ child policy is the most insidious policy , thoroughly antihuman and racially discriminatory , an open trampling on the right of survival right for __name3__ people as a whole . those who formulated and implemented this policy are all __name1__ ; they should be brought to trial at the __name2__ , and the people principally responsible for it should be hanged .
this guy really is a " representative ", a @-@ ha .
as known to all , __name1__ and __name2__ have very low birth rates and mainly depend on migrants to maintain their population sizes and keep their populations young ; there is good economic development ;
in recent years , due to labor shortages , millions of black people and __name1__ have come to the __name1__ , and have caused varied degrees of deterioration in social order .
just like __name2__ and __name3__ , __name1__ depends on immigrants and at the same time pursues the __quant1__ @-@ child policy , making the planning policy look like a very clever policy !
__name1__ and __name2__ maintain their social development by absorbing migrants from other provinces , what will happen if __name3__ prepares herbal medicine by the prescribed method and absorbs foreigners ?
do n't wait till the situation has become unmanageable and then drive away the gypsies as __name1__ did ; __name3__ chancellor __name2__ has just recently declared that germany has failed to build a diversified society and will limit the development of the immigrant population ; now that the sheep have been stolen , no choice but to mend the fold !
before long , the dividends for the population would wear out . as immigrant laborers swarmed in ( these people are not subject to family planning ) , the population would soon experience racial replacement , and __name1__ , as __name2__ did , would soon disintegrate !
the blacks , __name1__ , and __name2__ , one after another , would demand their rights , autonomy , and independence !
one after another , the local areas would become independent , as __name1__ did !
the minority peoples in __name1__ and __name2__ can bear more children , causing the proportion of the __name3__ people compared to the population of the frontier ethnic regions to decline quickly ;
the regiments of troops and __name1__ women that such national heroes as __name2__ and __name3__ took great pains to transplant into __name4__ and __name5__ are being quickly exterminated by the __quant1__ @-@ child policy ; the undercurrents of __name6__ and __name7__ are getting ever more rampant !
the family planning policy and the __quant1__ @-@ child policy have put the country in an dangerous as stacking eggs , and posed a threat to the survival of the nation .
family planning has effectively reduced the __name1__ population by 300 million , postponing the __name2__ by __quant1__ years ; according to the plan of the __name3__ , even if the __name4__ population is reduced by __quant2__ billion , the day of 7 billion will be postponed for just another few years !
but the __name1__ nation will be on the brink of extinction . such selfless notions which nobody will have until evolving into a nonhuman creature , surprisingly , has become a reality in china !
the issues of population and ethnical structure are major issues for the survival of the country !
family planning is part of the plan to massively exterminate the __name1__ people , and the beginning of dividing __name2__ !
the family planning policy is extremely stupid and the ultimate in self @-@ castration . it is unprecedented from a historic perspective and will be unmatchable in the future ; and in the global perspective , it is totally unique !
the self @-@ harming policy fully embodies the malice of the enemy and the stupidity of the those in power , brings disasters to both the country and the people , is totally void of conscience , contributes nothing to the contemporary time , leaves a legacy of trouble for a long time in future , and will definitely become a joke that those throughout all history will ridicule !
the other day , __name1__ reported that the difficulty for enterprises to hire workers has extended to the west and swept the whole country !
the family planning policy is extremely stupid , brings disasters to both the country and the people , and is totally void of conscience !
improving population quality requires transferring reproduction rights to the rich ?
through free exchanges on the market , nearly everything can be bought and sold .
today , the right to bear a __value1__ child is also becoming a popular product with the rich .
they have money to buy the right , to bear the child , and to raise the child .
as to these transfers and transactions of the right to bear a __value1__ child , let 's have a look at how the representatives argued and legally struggled with government officials at the " two meetings ".
why did they propose such a transfer on the right to bear a __value1__ child ?
to this question , li xinghao @-@ the author of this proposal , __name1__ representative and chairman of zhigao group , said that such a transfer is beneficial to improving the quality of the population .
transferred to which kind of person , exactly ?
this representative identified __quant1__ groups : first , people with strong educational backgrounds ; second , the rich class ; third , civil servants .
li xinghao asserts that " in today 's society , people with strong educational backgrounds , the rich class , and civil servants have relatively high social status , relatively good economics means , and can ensure basic educational conditions and a good environment for the newborn population to develop in ".
why is such transfer practical ?
li xinghao gave his own specific explanation from the angle of market supply and demand .
he said , " for a transfer , people are not classified into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not .
he said that the original motive for this proposal was rooted in his discovery that some families legally allowed to bear a __value1__ child , due to their poverty and other reasons , would become even more impoverished if they were to do so ;
while some rich families had a strong desire to bear a __value1__ child but did not have the allowance to do so .
he thinks that this conflict really exists , and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a transfer platform ."
this transfer proposal by representative li is indeed very smart .
on the one hand , it helps the government to reduce and narrow the gap of wealth ;
on the other hand , it also solves the structural conflict of the reproduction right market @-@ the poor have allowances but cannot afford the birth and upbringing , while the rich want to bear children but do n't have the allowance .
based on representative li 's proposal , the rich will voluntarily reduce their per capita wealth by bearing and raising more children , while the poor will increase their per capita wealth by bearing and raising fewer children .
through such transfers and transactions of the right to bear a __value1__ child between the rich and the poor , the government can unnoticeably narrow the ever @-@ increasing gap between the poor and the rich without spending a single cent .
how can the wealth gap be narrowed through such transfer ?
this representative li has envisioned a fast track for the get @-@ rich @-@ first people to guide and assist the get @-@ rich @-@ later people . that is , " the allowance transferee shall give the transferor ' an entire sequence ' of help and support ."
" according to li xinghao 's plan , through lottery @-@ type drawing , the transfer platform establishes a one @-@ on @-@ one guidance and assistance relationship between the transferee and the transferor .
as part of the assistance , the couple applying for the allowance to be transferred in to them will buy the transferring couple all the basic insurances currently required by the government , including social insurance , medical insurance , and personal accident insurance , and will continue to provide them with a minimum living guarantee for the rest of their lives .
meanwhile , the applicant couple will also provide financial support for the education of the transferring couple 's child until he or she graduates from university .
what 's more , if the transferring couple intend to register as permanent urban residents , the applicant couple shall buy them a 35m2 socially subsidized apartment in the city where the applicants dwell , but all of the transferring couple 's land use rights in the countryside will belong to the applicant couple ."
what do our family planning officials think of this proposal that the state " utilize the transferring of rights to bear a __value1__ @-@ child to improve the population quality and make the get @-@ rich @-@ first help the get @-@ rich @-@ later so as to realize common prosperity "?
in response , " yesterday , __name1__ , director of guangdong provincial family planning commission , made his stance clear to the media that the right to reproduce is absolutely not transferrable .
in the event that the right to reproduce is transferred , it would not only be a violation of law , but also bring moral questions if it involved a transaction ."
through transferring their right to bear a __value1__ child and the concomitant obligations imposed on the transferees , the poor can get rich with the guidance and assistance from the get @-@ rich @-@ first class , if the proposal can pass and become law , the poor undoubtedly have found in the rich class , well @-@ educated class , and the bureaucratic class an obedient son to provide for them up until they die . marvelous indeed .
he claims it is not a transaction , but how can it be otherwise ? in this bundle of obligations for common prosperity , where is the dignity of the poor ?
does not the bundle of obligations proposed by this representative li still imply a contract on the exchange and transaction of land use rights ?
certainly , without such exchange of interests , why would the rich take an interest in providing for the children of the poor ?
if the legislature really wants to adopt this proposal on the premise of the get @-@ rich @-@ first class leading the get @-@ rich @-@ later class to become rich by giving them one @-@ on @-@ one guidance and assistance so as to improve our population quality and narrow our wealth gap , it must ensure fairness in such exchange of interests and during the transfer .
transferred together with a wet nurse .
following it with interest .
for a transfer of the right to marry , people are not classified into the rich and the poor , but into those who have a demand and those who do not . since i discovered that some men who have a legal right to marry , due to their poverty and other reasons , would become even more impoverished if they did marry ;
while some rich men have a strong desire to marry n concubines ( because their mistresses often fuss about wanting to get married ) but they do not have the allowance , and would be guilty of bigamy .
i think that this conflict really exists , and the relevant governmental departments can take the initiative to establish a platform to transfer the right to marry .
pillaging the flesh till the bones are seen ?
interesting ... interesting
logic of hooligans .
directly transfer the wife
a pack of luxury cigarettes ranges from as little as a few __quant2__ of yuan to more than a __quant3__ yuan , if you smoke a stick , you are puffing away __quant1__ month 's salary for an ordinary worker .
if it was bought with public funds , it may be said that what they are smoking are not cigarettes but the " blood and sweat " of the taxpayers .
__name1__ representative ma wenfang proposed that consumption of tobacco products on public expenses should be universally banned .
there are of course many reasons as to why we lag far behind in meeting our tobacco control objectives .
but one of the undisputable reasons is that a huge smoker 's group exists within our huge contingent of civil servants .
among this legion of smokers , a considerable number smoke " free cigarettes " which they do n't have to buy with their own money , as they were received as gifts or bought with public funds .
it is precisely because they are not using their own money that they usually smoke luxury cigarettes which are unaffordable for most people .
their track performance for blowing smoke rings also has a compounding effect in repeatedly setting new records for consumption expenses by civil servants , and it has become an organic portion of officialdom corruption as a whole .
it was precisely this horrifying social backdrop that prompted __name1__ representative ma wenfang to solemnly set forth her proposal that consumption of tobacco products on public funds be universally banned .
in our country , there are many civil servants who think their family name is " gong " and such that every expense incurred by them , regardless of whether it is for public or private purpose , should be borne by the public . therefore , consumption on public expenses can involve almost everything imaginable .
for instance , besides luxury cigarettes , other examples include luxury liquor , fine wining and dining , luxury cars , and overseas tours , and whatever luxury enjoyment and extravagant entertainment they can imagine , they would want to have them all and enjoy them to fullest , using public funds to settle the bill in full .
if the supreme authorities had to draw up separate regulatory documents to address every single item for consumption on public expenses for nationwide circulation in order to check such extravagances , the mountain of documents will really extend towards the sky .
in fact , all that needs to be done is to clearly include tobacco products within the anti @-@ corruption regulations ' relevant clauses for prohibition of consumption on public funds , and it will suffice .
as for the remaining issues , we must ensure that the orders and prohibitions are fully enforced . if any civil servant dares to violate the law , he will be severely punished according to the law and regulations .
if this was really carried out in all localities at every level , there would be no cause to worry that the corrupt practice of consumption on public expenses , including smoking on public funds , cannot be curbed .
after deputies and committee members have moved into their quarters in the hotel , how would service staff greet them ?
some greet them with " deputy __name1__ @-@ __name1__ @-@ __name1__ " or " committee member so @-@ and @-@ so ; " while some call __name2__ deputies " chief , " which makes some deputies , especially deputies from the grass @-@ roots level , feel somewhat embarrassed . some deputies even request service staff to " not call me chief ."
calling deputies and committee members who have moved into their quarters in the hotel " chief " is , of course , out of the hotel service staff member 's formal respect , but it has actually caused misunderstanding of the identity of deputy or committee member .
as major national events , the convening of the __quant1__ conferences has clearly provided the path ahead for our development .
however , at the __quant1__ conferences , according to common sense , the identity of " deputy " or " committee member " is generally used , that is , " deputy xx " or " committee member xx." but i cannot say much for the mention of " deputy as a chief ."
through the subtlety of greeting , we can see common people 's sense of awe towards " deputies " and " committee members ."
actually , when providing services to deputies and committee members , what 's wrong with being a bit simple ?
would n't it appear more cordial to directly greet them as " deputy xx " or " committee member xx ? "
after greeting them as chiefs , do n't you have a sense of awe and awkwardness ?
as deputies , they should equally treasure their own __value1__ identity . deputy or committee member is neither an administrative official post nor a honorary title . this identity means enormous responsibility .
at the " times of the __quant1__ conferences , " deputies and committee members should have an even heightened sense of responsibility . no matter what kind of social status you yourself have , remember firmly your own __value1__ identity and most important identity is a deputy , a committee member .
this is just a tidbit at the __quant1__ conferences . the conferences that follow will unfold more exciting contents in front of us .
they are scumbags
gosh , they even dare to use the word ' awe .' common people could n't wait to ' despise ' them , how could they have a sense of ' awe ? '
what would you say , which thingy there is publicly elected by common people formed by the __value1__ , __value2__ , and __value3__ person such as you , me , and him ?
before the __quant1__ national conferences were convened , various major news websites and periodicals across the country in succession invited netizens and readers nationwide to submit " suggestions for the two conferences ."
this writer from " suggestions for the __quant1__ conferences " submitted by netizens across the country on various major news websites on the central government 's strengthening of efforts to oppose corruption and promote honest government , better supervision of the government and officials , and severe punishment for people engaged in embezzlement and corruption .
when __name1__ delegate mao xinyu checked in to attend the " __quant1__ conferences " and spoke of a motion he proposed this year , he said the emphasis was on anti @-@ corruption efforts .
the anti @-@ corruption drive involves everyone , from the ordinary people below up to and including the delegates to the __quant1__ conferences .
at present , public expenditure on food and entertainment nationwide has already reached __quant1__ __quant2__ year .
such a huge figure for public expenditure on food and entertainment crowds out expenditure on things vital for people 's welfare , including education , hygiene , healthcare , and social security .
figures listed in a bill drawn up by the __name1__ 's central organization before the __quant1__ conference in __year1__
are really unbelievable : __quant1__ public expenditure on food and entertainment actually reaches __quant2__ ! how large is this figure of __quant3__ ?
if we saved this __quant1__ and invested it in the economically undeveloped and impoverished regions in __name1__ , how many schools could we build ?
how many poor families could we assist ? how many children forced to leave school could we assist ?
it 's a pity that this __quant1__ is squandered with no results , wasted in the pursuit of debauchery , by corrupt officials - how could our people not hate the " parasites " hidden among the membership ranks of the __name1__ ?
when corruption among government officials is brought up , the ordinary people all gnash their teeth , but the ordinary people are , after all , the ordinary people , and can only look on helplessly in silent fury .
the ordinary people cannot afford to upset government officials , for if the ordinary people dared to upset government officials , they would be cracking eggs against rocks . not only could they get more than they bargained for ; if something went wrong , they could end up in prison , or even endanger their lives .
every year , there are cases across the country where ordinary people , because of reporting government officials , suffer the disaster of imprisonment if they get up lightly or the disaster of death if they are dealt with harshly .
it is common for ordinary people , with no other means of redress , to post on the internet out of resentment against savage land requisitions or the savage demolition of homes and forced relocation by local government officials , but what fate do they often bring on themselves ?
local government officials easily pin some labels on you , and you can even be chased and arrested by public security bodies across provincial boundaries .
the most terrible thing is not the government officials , but the power that lies in the hands of these officials .
how can we prevent the " __quant1__ types of consumption on public funds ? "
if we are to prevent the " __quant1__ types of consumption on public funds , " we must first " block " the officials ' mouths ,
but this is easier said than done . why ?
as people working in a lower @-@ level work unit , if leaders from higher @-@ level work units come , do you dare not to entertain them in the most respectful way with nice things to eat and drink ?
if they are not entertained well with nice things to eat and drink , after they 've gone , will officials in the lower @-@ level work unit still have a future ?
to their subordinates , senior leaders are all their " masters." you can n't afford to upset any of them , and whoever upsets them is in for it . if you rub them up the wrong way when you 're trying to butter them up , you won't just jeopardize your official position , you won't even know what the consequences will be .
to stop the " __quant1__ types of consumption on public funds , " senior officials must first " block " their own mouths .
in __month1__ __year1__ , when the no. 6 inspection group of __name1__ 's provincial party committee went to __name2__ city on an inspection tour of __name3__ county , a national @-@ level impoverished county , the local government officials were both delighted and worried .
what delighted them was that they had an opportunity to report their problems to senior leaders and have them taken seriously by them , and what worried them was that there were __quant1__ people in the inspection group , coming for __quant2__ days or so , and the entertainment expenses , the cost of the gifts , and the inspection fees and various other items of expenditure would altogether come to __quant3__ yuan .
how could this national @-@ level impoverished county pay the bills ?
this example is the best illustration that if we are to prevent the " __quant1__ types of consumption on public funds , " we must first stop the senior government officials .
if the upper beams are correctly placed , the lower beams will not go awry .
if the central state authorities are to stop the " __quant1__ types of consumption on public funds , " they must dare to do what they mean .
it should be said that wining and dining on public funds as pointed out by scholars is an objective reality .
with the increasing prevalence of the alcohol culture at the grass @-@ roots institutions , alcohol has already been fermented and adulterated by the so @-@ called " bureaucratic culture " beyond recognition .
some people put on high @-@ end wine banquets trying to please their superiors , some people use alcohol as gifts to seek personal gain , some people consider it a type of pleasure to get people to drink by using beer games , and some people get carried away because of their addiction to alcohol or drunkenness , adversely affecting their work .
every year the amounts of food trashed and money wasted as a result of wining and dining on public funds are even more appalling .
this writer has lived for a long time at the grass @-@ roots level and often heard and witnessed some grass @-@ roots officials almost sitting at meal gatherings or attending banquets every day , and never getting tired of it .
how much is the wining and dining expense at the grass @-@ roots level in __quant1__ year ? a specific number is virtually never published .
actually , the insiders are well aware that this is a considerably high expenditure .
who should be blamed for the grass @-@ roots officials ' wining and dining becoming common practice ?
speaking with regard to the grass @-@ roots levels , it is indeed necessary to conduct rectification and to straighten things up according to the relevant regulations , but focusing on the grass @-@ roots levels alone may not be enough .
throughout the year , various types of inspection groups and investigation groups , as numerous as the hairs on an ox , come and go in an endless stream , also making the grass @-@ roots institutions overburdened . some grass @-@ roots leading cadres , with no choice but to run between the various dinner parties every day , also feel somewhat helpless .
there are also many people wallowing in the array of wine glasses and poker chips becoming " vessels for wine and bags for food ."
this writer met with some township officials . facing more and more dinner parties , many of them are fed up with it , but also feel forced and helpless .
the reasoning they explained is that entertaining is just for solving problems .
a township official , using his fingers to count , told this writer that in order to solve financial , road repair , canal construction projects and so on , they must entertain the relevant personnel and department heads , otherwise it will be of no avail .
when i look back to all these years , the urban construction in __name1__ has experienced rapid development .
some people said that it borrowed the easterly wind of the __name1__ . however , i think otherwise .
even though the __year1__ __name1__ allowed __name2__ to display its charisma in front of cameras of all caliber that frocked in from all sides ,
it has almost been __quant1__ years since the __name2__ and the urban development in __name1__ still has not stopped .
speaking of urban development , the most representative one is none other than the __name1__ subway .
those who were born and raised in __name1__ in the 80 s can almost be called the generation who grew up sitting on the subway .
the public transportation then could not be considered as convenient compared to now . buses could hardly be said as providing easy access to all directions .
however , with their extensive coverage , the __quant1__ subway lines provided novelty and convenience to many __name1__ residents and visitors who travelled from afar .
the subway is a distinguishing traffic feature of __name1__ . as __value1__ of the __value1__ __name2__ cities to have underground transportation , the emergence of subway has provided everyone more choices .
this underground railway line that runs through eastern and western beijing has become beijing 's symbol of alternative culture .
day by day , __name1__ is developing , so are its public transport and highways . eventually , it will usher in the alarming data of __quant1__ cars in __year1__ .
meanwhile , the crowded highways and complicated road traffic cause people to have greater expectations in the development of the subway .
i have to applaud the continuous increase in the efforts in subway construction of __name1__ in all these years when i talk about subway development .
in __month1__ __year1__ , with the success in the bid to host the __name3__ , __name2__ __name1__ also ushered in the completion of the entire line and became the newest member of the beijing subway family .
meanwhile , in __month1__ __year1__ , the closely watched subway __name1__ went into operation . it became the new trunk that links southern and northern __name2__ and intersects with __name3__ .
while __name4__ residents enjoyed the modernization of subway __name5__ , in __month1__ __year1__ , the __value1__ phase of construction of subway __name1__ and in __month2__ __year2__ , subway __name2__ and __name3__ all became operational __value1__ after another . at the same time , all suburban districts and counties are all connected by the subway successively .
in about __quant3__ years time , the __name1__ subway transformed from an underground supplementary means of transport that only had __quant2__ lines to a __quant1__ @-@ lined underground transportation network that covers almost the entire __name1__ from __name2__ in the north to __name3__ in the south , __name4__ in the west , and __name5__ in the east .
such rapid development was almost unimaginable by anyone and unachievable by any country .
while __year1__ is quickly approaching , there is even the spectacular scene of __quant1__ lines opening at the same time . it is veritably " putting all firepower into operation "!
the rapid coverage of underground transportation has brought along prosperity to surrounding communities of the subway . residents no longer have to worry about which bus route to take when they go out .
more residents gladly choose to travel by subway . it is both convenient and cozy .
needless to say , the subway has brought about convenience to the travel and work of the residents . more commendable is that the convenient subway has allowed more residents to give up their cars and choose such green means of transportation that is environmental friendly .
not only does a reduction in cars on the road alleviate traffic pressure on the road ; it also reduces the pressure of air pollution so that more residents can cheer for the blue sky of __name1__ from their heart .
these are all contributions of the subway . yet , where did the contributions of the subway come from ? they were naturally from the rapid development of the subway in __name1__ within these __quant1__ years .
the development of the subway is the same as the rapid global development of the city of __name1__ , it will become a permanent city symbol of __name2__ and a benefiting project that earns the satisfaction of the residents and the respect of the world .
__name1__ forces __name2__ @-@ __name2__ to declare stand on unification , __name3__ can no longer turn back
it can be said that the elections that cover __quant1__ major cities have stirred up a storm in __name1__ .
in the midst of all this commotion , __name1__ made a sudden appearance to come head to head with __name2__ @-@ __name2__ in the elections .
this made the already worried __name1__ @-@ __name1__ even more anxious , but there is nothing he can do .
this is linked to the earlier stand mainland __name1__ made regarding military cooperation with __name2__ . in addition , __name3__ has expressed clearly that his taking part in the elections is to tell __name5__ @-@ __name5__ that he had worked hard to get the __name4__ from mainland __name1__ and __name5__ should not let everyone down .
regarding the chaos in __name1__ and the future ultimate unification of mainland __name2__ and taiwan , what else do we still need to face ? what else do we have to do ?
regarding the " weathervane " of __name1__ @-@ __name1__ 's stand , what other preparations should we make ?
__name1__ 's transfer of allegiance is to force the undecided __name2__ @-@ __name2__ to declare his stand on the ultimate unification
__name1__ 's transfer of allegiance is , in a certain sense , a kind of response to mainland __name2__ 's intention .
on the issue of mainland __name2__ and __name3__ , __name1__ @-@ __name1__ has gotten a lot of room for maneuvering ,
from playing the __name1__ independence card for the sake of the elections to playing the card of attacking mainland __name2__ and achieving military balance for the sake of the elections . however , on the issue of the ultimate unification of mainland china and __name1__ , not only did __name3__ @-@ __name3__ fail to make any progress , he even took a big step backward .
in the past , he was standing close to the middle . now , he is starting to gradually follow the footsteps of the __name1__ . he keeps pushing the bottom line of mainland __name2__ for the mere sake of manipulating the elections . furthermore , he completely ignores the compromises made by mainland __name3__ and the effort it has put in for peaceful unification .
to save the taiwanese economy , mainland __name1__ has made huge policy adjustments such as absorbing __name2__ 's excess industrial capacity , buying __name2__ 's excess agricultural products , giving several taiwanese political figures room for international affairs to carry out international affairs , etc.
however , after all this waiting , in the end it has to face __name1__ @-@ jeou'a a double @-@ headed snake that is seemingly false and real at the same time .
therefore , facing this undecided __name2__ @-@ __name2__ , __name1__ stepped up to defend mainland __name3__ !
is n't __name1__ @-@ __name1__ wanting to score more points for his selection ? is n't he wanting to elevate his position through manipulating the people ?
the moment __name1__ appeared , the situation changed ! this is to force __name2__ @-@ __name2__ to stop manipulating the elections and declare his stand on the ultimate unification of mainland __name3__ and __name4__ !
__name2__ @-@ __name2__ is not mainland __name1__ 's only choice , but mainland __name1__ is going to be __name2__ @-@ __name2__ 's only choice
so , what cards is old ma left with to play ?
military purchase - fetus died in the womb ;
economic development - eclipsed by the prosperity of mainland __name1__ ;
culture - fully integrated with mainland __name1__ as well ;
as for military affairs - __name2__ soldiers , whether ex @-@ service or in service , are all under the control of mainland __name1__ 's military departments .
as for the key __name2__ figures who hold military power , mainland __name1__ has long ago convinced them with reasons .
fellow countrymen should not slaughter one another , and brothers should not turn against one another - this makes the __name1__ military less hostile towards mainland __name2__ .
as for the withdrawal of missiles proposed by __name1__ @-@ __name1__ , it is also no longer an issue now .
so what is __name1__ @-@ __name1__ still waiting for ? for a major change to take place in __name2__ ?
to mainland __name1__ , __name2__ @-@ __name2__ is no longer mainland __name1__ 's only choice .
mainland __name1__ is actively seeking all forces in __name2__ that can be sought . even the __name3__ is starting to change its course .
however , __name1__ @-@ __name1__ , who is holding on and keeping his mouth tight , has no other choices except mainland __name2__ , in other words , mainland __name2__ is __name1__ @-@ __name1__ 's only choice .
basically , all the big bosses of the __name1__ have visited mainland __name2__ and even received vip treatment , getting all the respect they deserved .
so , is __name1__ @-@ __name1__ thinking about his future position or the great cause of the national unification ?
__name1__ @-@ __name1__ might offend some people in __name2__ who are eager to achieve taiwan independence , but __name1__ @-@ __name1__ can gain the respect of the entire __name3__ population of __quant1__ . comparing the __quant2__ , it should be clear which is important and which is not .
when __name1__ visited china back then , he turned the __name2__ @-@ __name3__ relationship around . so , does n't __name4__ @-@ __name4__ want his name to go down in history ?
could it be that being the bill of a chicken is really better than being the anus of an ox ?
hence , __name1__ @-@ __name1__ should understand that he is only one of the choices of mainland __name2__ . it is up to him whether he wants to achieve success and acquire fame .
watch out for __name1__ @-@ __name1__ 's continued military resistance against unification by the lease @-@ to @-@ own method
though the __name1__ has recently increased its military presence in the __name3__ region , it is showing a rare undecided stand on the __name2__ issue .
the __name2__ is no longer able to tell where taiwan is heading , because all __name1__ senior politicians are talking about unification and there is less and less talk about secession .
furthermore , a certain tacit agreement between mainland __name1__ and __name3__ regarding the __name2__ has made the __name4__ feel somewhat unable to do what it wants to do .
however , some people from the __name1__ and __name2__ are still somewhat intelligent .
they no longer talk about military purchase but started proposing a lease @-@ to @-@ own method for __name1__ to get weapons .
the weapons __name1__ has now are old .
the lease @-@ to @-@ own method might bring some advantages in conducting cutting @-@ edge military confrontation with mainland __name2__ , but fundamentally speaking , __name1__ no longer has the strength to fight against mainland __name2__ .
if it continues to take its old path of resisting unification through military forces , then it will meet a very tragic ending !
__name1__ will be a touchstone - __name2__ can no longer turn back
of course , there are still many opportunities for mainland __name1__ and __name2__ . for example , the __name5__ is the __value1__ touchstone of cooperation between mainland __name3__ and __name4__ .
when it comes to the __name3__ , mainland __name1__ and __name2__ can jointly deploy naval vessels , jointly defend the __name3__ , and join hands in fighting __name4__ .
recently , within taiwan , active actions have been taken concerning the ownership of __name1__ as well .
for example , there have been active changes as to how the __name1__ issue is treated , how the historical issue of the resistance war is treated , and how the issue of __name3__ as part of mainland __name2__ in the past is treated .
it is these changes that made the entire __name1__ , from top to bottom , reach a consensus that it can survive by staying close to mainland __name2__ .
facing mainland __name1__ 's offensive efforts towards unification , __name2__ can no longer turn back .
__name3__ will become another traitor if it goes into __name2__ 's embrace . only by going into mainland __name1__ 's embrace will __name3__ have a bright future !
in short , __name2__ is merely someone through whom mainland __name1__ 's stance ranging from active cooperation to slight warning is demonstrated .
if __name1__ @-@ __name1__ does not want to oversleep after going back to bed in the morning , he must truly face what the people of both sides of the strait have been hoping for for __quant1__ century !
it is up to him whether he wants to be a sinner of the nation or a meritorious contributor to the nation !
when that time comes , the people of mainland __name1__ will respond enthusiastically to __name2__ @-@ __name2__ !
what 's going on !
damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . why are they coming out ?
endangering the society !
really , one should not be a samaritan
if you help the other person get up but she does not appreciate it and even pushes you , then you should not help her anymore .
yet you help her again ...
do n't tell jokes at the seaside . it will trigger tsunami
it is really too tragic
meeting violence with violence does not benefit anyone
woes of the society .
those who make trouble after getting drunk should be punished without leniency . detestable
the following is a quote from qiuyeyuanmaoerkong from the __value1__ posting :
the perpetrators are not going to be held responsible just because they said they are poor ! ? who dares to be a samaritan in future ! ? ...
it is really tough being a good person .
the old man was looking for trouble ...
nowadays , there are many scumbags around~
the following is a quote from *miyamiya* from the __value1__ posting :
nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either
damn , nowadays one should not be a good person
" the society always makes you feel painfully scared . every day , there always seem to be countless reasons that make people curse ! "
this is well said ...
this is what you call unforeseen misfortune
people say , do not do good things . he did n't listen ... sigh ,
scary
the following is a quote from ninth inspiration from the __value1__ posting :
what 's going on ! damn , these people who do n't learn to be good should rot at home . why are they coming out ? endangering the society ! ...
why did n't they get knocked down by a car and die after getting drunk ? scumbags !
the following is a quote from zhukong81 from the __value1__ th posting :
woes of the society ...
good people are beaten into extinction just like this , they 're all done for
right , you 're so old , why did you go and help a young man up ... it 's tough to be a good person
it 's tough to be a good person
never be a good person ... always remember ...
if severe punishment is not given , in future everyone will pretend to be drunk and make trouble

a letter from the victim 's family
first of all , i would like to thank a kind @-@ hearted person for calling the police immediately . i would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrators .
early in the morning on __month1__ __day1__ , my father , as usual , was riding his bicycle to gucheng park for exercise . at jiuli street , he saw someone lying on the side of the road , and so , out of kindness , he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon . then , __quant1__ people ran up to him , kicking and beaing him ( according to the police , they had drunk __quant2__ cases of beer at the time ) . as a result , my father 's skull suffered serious injury . he bled profusely and lost consciousness . by the time he was taken to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . however , with prompt rescue given by a doctor , he survived . as there was serious bleeding , the doctor performed a life @-@ saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father 's head to remove blood clots . due to profuse bleeding , some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain , putting his life in danger .
right now , my father is in very serious condition . on __month2__ __quant2__ , he underwent a __quant1__ @-@ hour craniotomy . on __month2__ __day2__ , he had a tracheotomy and a respirator was used to help him breathe . currently , he is still unconscious . after these few days of hospital treatment , he is sometimes able to move his arms and feet , and he is showing signs of recovery .
as his children , we feel very terrible now . it has been __quant3__ days since the incident . under the police 's advice , the perpetrators finally gave __quant1__ yuan . we have already delivered the money to the hospital . now , almost __quant2__ yuan has been spent on the medical bills . we do n't know when we can get money to pay for future medical bills .
we have now already received a payment reminder from the hospital . if we do not pay on time , the hospital will stop supplying medications . when that happens , i cannot bear to think of what will happen to my father .
our family has very poor living conditions . my mother only gets a minimum welfare pay of __quant1__ yuan , and she has diabetes . my father is a retired coking plant worker . his pay is also just a bit over __quant2__ yuan . i am doing odd jobs at a factory , and i have not even made any medical insurance or pension contributions . my elder sister is also an odd @-@ job worker . she has also not made any pension or medical insurance contributions . furthermore , i am going to be a father soon . i have a very heavy family burden . our family now can only rely on my father 's pay to survive . we absolutely cannot afford such high hospital costs .
it has been __quant1__ days since the incident . as victims , we have the rights of a citizen to know some things :
1 . where are the perpetrators from ? how are their family and financial conditions ?
2 . when can the case be submitted to the procuratorate ? when can public prosecution be initiated ?
3 . we hope the perpetrators can cooperate actively and take practical actions to work together to first save my father 's life .
4 . we request to meet the parents of the perpetrators .
we hope the news media can help us to jointly save the life of my kind @-@ hearted father .
we also ask the government departments to coordinate with one another and be flexible to activate my father 's medical insurance card and save his life .
after the court verdict is out , all medical costs will be paid back to the medical insurance bureau .
a __quant1__ thanks to the city residents and media for the concern they have shown us in this incident . may all you kind @-@ hearted people have a life of peace !
victim 's son
why helped him up when he was sleeping happily ?
faint . the social morality system is about to collapse . everything must be torn down and start all over again . sigh
manhunt . post the pictures of that bunch of perpetrators !
tragedy
what a turbulent society
nowadays , to be a good person is really not something you can do casually
hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities
nowadays , to be a good person is really not something you can do casually . hope the perpetrators can assume the responsibilities
sentence all of them to life imprisonment and let 's see if they are going to pay
poor old man . he 's still stuck in the era of learning from __name1__ . the society today is a mess .
it 's tough to be a good person !
it 's tough to be a good person !
punish severely ! it looks like we have to mind our own business !
it is legal as long as __quant1__ hours of sunshine can be achieved .
most high @-@ rise buildings with a spacing of __quant1__ meters can certainly achieve that .
__quant1__ hours of sunshine , from morning till night , can certainly be achieved .
most sunlight issues raised by the elderly men and women are indeed not against the national requirements , so they 're merely unreasonable complaints of the elderly as a result of their perceived discomfort .
even if there is a court judgment confirming that the developer is not against the law , they will still persist with their unreasonable demands .
reply to light @-@ and @-@ shadow @-@ hero on the __value1__ th floor :
__quant1__ hours of sunshine is a technical term . sunlight analysis is needed . setbacks of spacing are related to not only the sunshine spacing but also the floor thickness . a sunshine spacing coefficient of 1 @:@ 1.4 can meet the requirement for __quant2__ hours of sunshine on the day of great cold in __name1__ . all we want is that the developer does the job legally , and makes it clear that sunshine analysis has shown that the minimum national requirements can be met !
but what you said is also somewhat reasonable . the minimum standards are not acceptable to most people . they have a good reason to ask for more sunlight . however , this developer is too strong . we just want to secure the minimum legitimate interests according to the national regulations , but even that is so difficult for us !
__name1__ and operations , alas .
i remain poised
__name1__ : there are too many issues now ! is that because good officials are too few ?
developers always want to make more money . we have a building here , which has not been pulled down so far even after exposed by __name1__ . how powerful the developers are .
the following is a quotation of all owners of pengxinlidu building no. 14 's words on the __value1__ st floor :
all netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in general secretary __name1__ 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer ! ...
uh ... do you have legislative power or enforcement power ?
in __name1__ , __name2__ , an old man doing morning exercise helped a drunk man up and was mistaken as a thief and badly beaten up
__quant1__ young men who work as chefs at zhenjiang hotel were strolling on the street in the early morning on the __day1__ nd after downing several bottles of beer .
one of the men , ji , squatted on the stone step of a bus stop .
mr. yang , an old man from __name1__ who is in his __quant1__ s , was passing by while on his morning exercise . after seeing that , he asked ji to go home soon , and then held out his hands to help ji up .
however , ji mistook mr. yang for wanting to steal his things , so immediately together with wu and ma , he battered the old man violently till he was seriously injured !
murderers all go for the head !
i think they meant to kill him !
latest news : victim mr. yang passed away around __time1__ a.m . on __time1__ @/@ __day1__ @/@ __year1__ . perpetrators remain under criminal detention .
however , this incident has not yet come to a close . the victim 's family may still have to wait for the police to conduct an autopsy on the victim .
regarding this incident , both sides involved have posted relevant comments in this thread . they are in postings no. __value1__ and no. __value2__ .
a letter from the victim 's family
first of all , i would like to thank a kind @-@ hearted person for calling the police immediately . i would also like to thank the public security authority for the prompt capture of the perpetrators .
early in the morning on __month1__ __day1__ , my father , as usual , was riding his bicycle to gucheng park for exercise .
at jiuli street , he saw someone lying on the side of the road , and so , out of kindness , he went up to check up on him and ask him to go home soon .
then , __quant1__ people ran up to him , kicking and beating him
( according to the police , they had drunk __quant1__ cases of beer at the time ) ,
as a result , my father 's skull suffered serious injury . he bled profusely and lost consciousness . by the time he was taken to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated .
however , with prompt rescue given by a doctor , he survived .
as there was serious bleeding , the doctor performed a life @-@ saving surgery to cut off a piece of skull from my father 's head to remove blood clots .
due to profuse bleeding , some of the blood had already flowed into the brainstem and bottom of the brain , putting his life in danger .
right now , my father is in very serious condition .
on __month2__ __day1__ , he underwent a __quant1__ @-@ hour craniotomy . on __month2__ __day2__ , he had a tracheotomy , and a respirator was used to help him breathe .

victim 's son
latest development
victim : old mr. yang is currently still unconscious and in critical condition .
the family members of old mr. yang said tearfully that when the old man was being sent to the hospital , his pupils were already dilated . he has been transferred to icu ( intensive care unit ) after receiving emergency treatment given by the hospital .
the medical costs alone add up to as much as more than __quant1__ yuan __quant2__ day .
perpetrators : __quant1__ men have been criminally detained by __name2__ __name1__ police .
after the __quant1__ of them paid __quant2__ yuan in total for the medical costs ,
the family of ma recently again raised __quant1__ yuan to pay for surgery .
hereby , we hope the perpetrators will be able to show resolution in taking on responsibilities and face seriously the mistake that has been committed .
victim 's family : as old mr. yang is still in a toxic and unconscious state , he is unable to provide information about what happened at the time of the incident .
though the __quant1__ perpetrators have paid __quant2__ yuan compensation in total , it is obviously not enough to pay for the current medical costs that are increasing sharply by the day .
furthermore , in view of the criminal detention time limit , can such punishment have a deterrent effect on the perpetrators ?
how about future medical costs ?
the yang family hopes to get legal and media assistance .
associated incidents
the moment this incident came out , this writer could not help but recall the " touch porcelain " case that happened __quant1__ years ago !
cases like the one where " a vehicle owner who helped an old lady lying on the ground get up was accused of knocking her down " all raised a huge uproar across town .
sometimes , i even doubt the frequency at which such incidents happen , life is getting to really look like fiction !
the society always makes you feel painfully scared . every day , there always seem to be countless reasons that make people curse .
let 's not say much . let 's pray for the injured and hope the perpetrators get punished .
the perpetrators are not going to be held responsible just because they said they are poor ! ?
who dares to be a samaritan in future ?
the important thing is to save life !
are there any solutions ? provide legal assistance !
let the law show its might~
it takes __quant1__ days before public prosecution is initiated . even day lilies wither by then ! ~
this is actually not about being a samaritan or not . many drunkards have lost their consciousness and will get in a drunken fit .
when you want to help , you have to see who it is . if you can n't handle , just call __value1__ . sigh ...
severe punishment still should be given to those who commit crimes after drinking . if not , it will be chaos if everyone pretends to be drunk and bashes up others .
nowadays , one should not do evil , but one should not do good , either
such a cup .
the old man was looking for trouble . he should have kept a distance after seeing those drunkards .
would everyone agree with illegal construction of high @-@ rise buildings ?
now , in the hometown of our beloved general secretary __name1__ , such a strange thing is happening .
here is the thing : shenzhen maoye developer has come to __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ for urban construction , and is welcomed by our people .
we do not oppose the construction of high @-@ rise buildings . however , the developer is going to construct a high @-@ rise building against the law . that is what we are resolutely opposed to !
maoye developer has planned a high @-@ rise building of __quant1__ m in the julangchao lot of the old east station , __name1__ , __name2__ .
julangchao used to be the eastern suburbs park , for which many of the old __name1__ people have great affection .
pengxinlidu building no. 14 is just located at the back of the julangchao lot , and now pengxinlidu building no. 14 is only about __quant1__ meters from the external walls of the original buildings at the farthest end of the julangchao lot .
how does the developer meet the national requirement for building setbacks based on a minimum sunshine spacing of 1 @:@ 1.4 in __name1__ ?
aside from the other sunshine shelters , how can the developer ensure a minimum __quant1__ hours of sunshine on the day of great cold ?
it is certainly not feasible if they want to cheat about the __quant1__ hours technically ,
the plain fact is just in front of us . moreover , are those few entities the only ones capable of doing sunshine analysis in __name1__ ?
we certainly will verify it . a lie will never become the truth !
if the developer can not even give us owners a minimum of __quant1__ hours on the day of great cold in accordance with the national requirement , which has ensured its best interests , how can it give a reasonable and fair explanation to the society , the vast community of netizens and the masses ?
where are the conscience and morals of the developer ?
we understand that the developer wants to get more benefits , but those are supposed to be legitimate benefits !
on the one hand , such act , if illegally infringing upon other people 's interests , will be detrimental to the reputation and long @-@ term future development of the entire __name1__ group . on the other hand , are people whose interests are infringed all fools ?
will they just let the infringement occur ?
the minimum __quant1__ hours is already difficult to accept . if it is basically an illegal act that makes the fundamental __quant2__ hours even less , think about it - how will things evolve ?
finally , the contradictions are bound to intensify , making the situation out of hand .
we hope that the developer can seriously think about this issue , avoid losses and seek its own legal interests through rational development and reasonable development according to law !
if the developer are determined to infringe on our rights and interests , we will surely unite as one to defend our legitimate rights and interests !
the most strange thing is that some people of high rank even agree with the illegal construction of high @-@ rise buildings . we hereby earnestly request the people of high rank who agree with the illegal construction of high @-@ rise buildings to raise their hands and give us a way out !
all netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in general secretary __name1__ 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer !
all netizens are welcome to look into this matter !
hello , everyone !
previously , due to issues about the high @-@ rise buildings on __name1__ 's pre @-@ sale renderings and eia by the taizhou municipal environmental protection bureau , the young and old of pengxinlidu building no. 14 were neither sleeping nor eating well . some were depressed , and some were irritated . in short , we felt very angry .
now taizhou municipal planning bureau has given us a clear answer that those were simply renderings . upon verification , the __name1__ has requested the developer to make modification . the __name2__ will definitely exercise administration according to law , and never approve anything unless it is legal , reasonable and fair ! a forum and a hearing will also be held prior to approval ! a large stone in our hearts has finally dropped onto the ground .
we are moved that in the face of such a huge benefit , our leaders of taizhou municipal government and taizhou municipal planning bureau have stood unswayed , showing a very noble sentiment and reflecting the characteristics of the __name1__ in serving the people , which is truly admirable !
all owners of pengxinlidu building no. 14 hereby express deep respect and gratitude to taizhou municipal government and taizhou municipal planning bureau for upholding justice ! people living in __name1__ are happy , thanks to the officials caring for them like their parents !
we thank the government for its concerns over people ! we strongly support for the government administration according to law !
all owners , pengxinlidu building no.14
__month1__ __day1__ , __year1__
i hope that the developer does not come to compete against us for sunlight . how do we live without sunlight ?
all netizens and media are welcome to look into this matter . let 's see whether it will ultimately be " power over law " or " law over power " for the officials in general secretary __name1__ 's hometown when dealing with matters concerning a big developer ! for us ordinary people who are like dog shit in this society , it is ridiculous to discuss whether power or law is superior .
i feel really good about that oh oh
what 's the point of law over power ?
it is the powerful that make the final execution .
yeah , in the real world , we vulnerable groups really feel at a loss as to what to do so often . the power of developers is too great ,
some relevant government departments just blatantly give the green light to developers against the law and help them fool people !
so we have to frequently ask ourselves : is the law enacted by this country really useful ?
is it really capable of restraining developers from grabbing through deceit or by force and illegally obtaining benefits ?
but we can not just watch as the developer take away our sunlight , leaving children and the elderly shivering at home in cold winter . if so , we can n't live a healthy life , nor can we enjoy the warmth of the sun !
__name1__ had been thinking about invading __name2__ for a long time . would it need the assignment from __name3__ to decide whether to invade __name2__ or not ? not to mention that the __name4__ only acts against the political system of china ? was it still not enough for __name5__ to be fooled after __year1__ ?
the weapons market in __name1__ has been dominated by the hairy country . though it is weakened by the __name3__ weapons market , however , the __name2__ weapons market still occupies the major portion .
it is not __name1__ deliberately making use of countries on the __name2__ to besiege __name3__ .
looking at the chaos in the __name3__ and the __name4__ , even thinking with your ass , you will also know that it is the __name1__ rather than __name2__ trying to cause trouble .
firstly , __name1__ is not a country with sea power . it has no interest in intervening and meddling in the issues of the __name2__ and __name3__ .
secondly , at present , with the expansion and extrusion of __name1__ , __name2__ can hardly protect its own traditional zone of influence . we can say it is busy enough with its own affairs .
and presently , the asia @-@ pacific military cooperation and __name1__ are all products of the __name2__ 's __quant1__ @-@ ocean strategy .
after __name1__ , __quant1__ systems had taken place . one is the versailles system in __name2__ and the __name3__ , and the other was the us @-@ japanese washington system in the __name4__ and the __name5__ .
the __name1__ stretches over the __quant1__ oceans , and controls the __quant2__ systems at the same time .
after __name5__ , it took control of the __quant1__ systems respectively , castrating __name1__ in __name2__ , and __name3__ staying alone in __name4__ to be hermaphrodites , living on by helping the us manufacture electronics and automobile products .
and now , the biggest enemies for the __name4__ are such large geopolitical powers in the __name1__ as __name2__ and __name3__ .
while __name2__ and the __name3__ have no so @-@ called estrangement in ideology and political system , __name1__ still continues to expand to the east .
and now the asia @-@ pacific military cooperation is setting up a blockage line and a ring of encirclement around the coastal regions in __name1__ and __name2__ .
the coup in __name1__ has not succeeded . otherwise , once the ring of encirclement is completed , the northern land will cause a headache to you just as the __name2__ and the __name3__ .
do you still believe that __name1__ can become a friend of the __name2__ as long as it changes its ideology and system ?
the reasons for __name3__ to ally with __name4__ are that both __name4__ and __name3__ need to heal their wounds from after the disintegration of the __name1__ and with the savage hegemony of the __name2__ .
solving the existing territorial disputes is an important means of realizing mutual trust . of course __name1__ has made great concessions . there is no other choice .
in fact , unlike __name2__ , __name1__ has neither the policy of reform of opening up nor a good future ( this precious opportunity was seized by __name3__ at the historical turning point then , while in __name4__ , it was ruined by the __quant1__ idiots at the critical moment . it also shows that the __name5__ are relatively inferior to the __name6__ people in terms of both iq and eq ) .
the __name1__ are bare @-@ footed , so they are not afraid of a __name2__ with shoes .
__name1__ has enough reasons to make concessions to __name3__ . __name1__ has no fear . __name1__ has many opportunities and __name2__ has other approaches .
although __name1__ is not our friend , we should not turn it into an enemy .
__name1__ and __name2__ should not be equated with each other .
to the chinese people , if __name2__ wantonly killed chinese people in __name1__ 's traditional area of activities like __name3__ did , then in the sentiments of ordinary chinese people , they would hate __name2__ as much as they hate japan . however , they did not .
the only case where they wantonly killed __name1__ people happened at the end of the __name2__ . it was the disputable hailanpao slaughter .
thousands or tens of thousands , the number is just a small proportion even compared with the population of the __name1__ .
it can even be ignored if compared with the __name1__ population of nearly 400 million . can it be equated with __name2__ 's massacre of __name3__ people in the populated north and southeast of china ?
besides , __name1__ is a __name2__ country with its strategic focus in the __name3__ . the __name4__ is never its focus .
if the __name1__ really want to seriously take __name3__ as their arch enemy , they should strive to construct the __name2__ .
however , nowadays , with its own serious problems , it continues to abandon the __name1__ and many cities have become heaps of ruins .
it shows that __name1__ 's strategic focus has been in the __name2__ , addressing the expansion of __name3__ . only traitors will be advocating hostile relations between __name4__ and __name1__ here .
the __name1__ can pose a greater threat and impact upon china than __name2__ , especially in the core area of china .
the reasons are simple . __name2__ is a __name1__ country . the __name3__ is not its focus , while the __name5__ is a country in the __name4__ @-@ __name4__ region .
do you know the theory of sea control ? nowadays , is there more influence from the __name1__ or __name2__ in the issues of the __name3__ and the __name4__ and the __name5__ ? it is the __name6__ ! this is clear proof !
do you think that territorial waters are n't territory ? in modern times , the strategic and economic values of territorial waters are much more than those of land territories . one can only become a strong power and have a say in the international community by controlling the sea .
why was it not __name3__ , its neighbor , but instead __name1__ , separated by vast oceans , that made __name2__ into a colony ?
nowadays , __name1__ has serious problems itself . its armaments are quite obsolete , and the living conditions for its people are extremely adverse . the population has faced a sharp reduction .
the national elites all know the home country is hopeless , so they all run abroad .
it has become common practice for women to marry foreigners , and many of them come to __name1__ and become prostitutes .
even the productivity of the population is seriously lacking . it is impossible for it to constitute a threat to __name1__ .
and nowadays the __name1__ is besieging and containing china openly with a view of disrupting china .
why leave the current problems unsolved , but seize on __name1__ , which has no ability to pose a threat to __name2__ at present ?
when it comes to that __name2__ occupied __name3__ 's territory , that is another story like the japanese did . __name4__ wanted to invade the whole country of __name1__ , but can __name2__ do that ?
__name4__ is a __name1__ country with its strategic focus on the __name2__ , rather than the __name5__ . its expansion to the __name5__ in history was also partly non @-@ governmental and partly governmental .
__name1__ is separated from __name4__ only by a strait , with the spacious __name3__ behind it . there is no menace from the rear if it invades __name4__ with all its strength . can __name2__ do that ?
even if __name2__ puts a little bit more energy into the issues of __name3__ and the __name4__ , can it ignore the affairs in __name1__ ?
moreover , we would rather say that __name1__ has availed itself of opportunities , than to say that it had invaded and occupied __name2__ 's territories .
at that time , those places were far away from __name1__ 's traditional living area . __name1__ 's exploration was a little bit later at that time . there have been few inhabitants around those places in history .
at that time , those places were bitterly cold places covered with waist @-@ deep snows . so we pay no heed to them .
although when it comes to now , these places are of great economic and strategic importance . however , at that time we did n't discover that ; therefore , at that time even the ruler of __name1__ paid no heed to the places , and sent no immigrants there for quite a long time .
just like today 's oceans . from the perspective of today , they have huge economic values , so territorial waters are also important territories .
however , in the past , they were not discovered . and territorial waters were not regarded as territories . they even exercised trade prohibition on the sea area and closed the coastlines .
yet the __name2__ availed themselves of a favorable geological location to occupy those places ahead of us . the __name2__ were just availing themselves of opportunities .
at that time , it was a time when big powers established colonies everywhere . unlike today , when the behavior of all countries are bound by international laws .
other big powers had to capture colonies by war . for example , it was through war that __name1__ and __name2__ occupied __name3__ and __name4__ respectively .
however , the __name1__ got such a big place without much effort . that was because the ruler of __name2__ did n't care for the unexplored places .
they just availed themselves of opportunities . things such as territory are hard to talk about .
if it was your imminent area of activity , it might be justifiable .
however , if it was a place that you did n't send immigrants to explore for a long period throughout history , and was taken by others because of a favorable geographical location and convenient access , then as time goes by it would be hard to say , after a certain length of time .
it would be barely passable for you to claim it to be yours . this is totally different from __name1__ . can __name2__ launch a barbaric war of aggression to occupy __name3__ 's imminent territories like japan did ?
can it provoke * to invade northeast china and launch an all @-@ out war of aggression against __name1__ because northeast china had become an imminent territory of china like northern china with the arrival and exploration of large number of immigrants from inside __name2__ ? it is impossible .
the opinions of the writer wuhan tuo la ji shou on the upper floor are brilliant ! however , by reversing the order of " subjugation of the nation " and " elimination of the entire race , " would it be in line with the historical facts ?
right now __name1__ is clamoring " to build __name2__ into the top military power in asia." __name3__ personally sealed the arms sale deal to sell __name6__ advanced weapons such as aircraft carriers , nuclear @-@ powered submarines , __name4__ fighters and __name5__ missiles ... even the weapons it sells to __name8__ are more advanced than those it sells to __name9__ . and it only sells __name9__ big airplanes and carrier aircraft . its wild ambitions are thoroughly exposed !
it is a pity that the present dynasty are national scum supported by the __name1__ ! while the yellow __name2__ are prevailing , what else can the grass @-@ root folks do ?
it seems that all __name1__ hate __name2__ , and i am not an exception . however , has everybody thought it over that it was __name6__ who stirred up the war between __name8__ and __name5__ for fear that __name4__ would reclaim territories from it ? it was also __name6__ that went between the __name3__ and the __name7__ and was able to achieve success one way or the other . and at the end of the war of resistance , it then stirred up the civil war , and lured china to get involved in the __name9__ . if __name11__ was still alive , __name10__ would have more trouble !
even if it has propped up an agent in china , it is still concerned about __name1__ . and in the __century1__ st century , it continues to play little tricks of provoking anti @-@ __name2__ sentiments . it sold weapons to __name3__ and checked and seized the cargos of __name4__ merchants . its crimes are so numerous that bamboo strips would be exhausted before they could all be recorded .
what is regretful is that our government deals with such kind of things in different ways . if the us or __name3__ does so , __name1__ and __name2__ would absolutely deliver a so @-@ called just and severe statement of condemnation . yet with regard to the incident of the __name5__ boatmen who were shot by __name4__ , there was not even a protest presented . and it became an incident with no definite results in the year __year1__ .
the greatest threat of subjugation of the nation comes from __name1__ . in history , countries being eliminated by this nation were as many as the stars in the sky . moreover , in the history of __name2__ , almost all geographical threats came from the north .
the greatest threat of " elimination of the entire race " comes from __name1__ . the seed of national hatred is indelible . once discharged accidentally , it would not be just territorial conflicts , but a massacre .
the greatest threat of downfall of __value2__ comes from the __name1__ . the dramatic contrast of ideology causes the __name2__ to treat all dictating ds in the world as targets to be removed .
however , there is no need to worry that he would have any claims for territory .
the greatest threat to the economy comes from the __name4__ . the __name4__ frequently takes the opportunity of trade or human right conflicts between __name2__ and the __name3__ to grab a large portion of the market , and squeezes the surplus values . now it has become our biggest trading partner .
personally i think the geopolitical environment of __name1__ is quite adverse . however , just as what the floor host said , the real threat comes from __name2__ .

nowadays , the development of the internet makes a lot of things very convenient ... with the increase of internet users , companies and enterprises pay much attention to their online
images . however , negative news about a company or enterprise spreads much faster than positive news . once spread out , it is unmanageable @/@ difficult to delete
negative news on the internet . online marketing or online publicity . for details , please contact at
__name1__ : __value1__
phone : __value1__
i come to support , support it
do you think nowadays that __name1__ still has the capacity to do that ?
if the __name4__ does not put the practical interests of the people first , but continues to tolerate the corrupt governments , the people would lose their faith in the party , and in the near future it could hardly be avoided that the territories of __name3__ would be divided by an alliance of the __name1__ and __name2__ !
it was foreseeable that they have put their hands into our neighboring countries , and they have instigated pressures on our country from all sides . has n't the government in power run by the __name1__ been claiming to be strong ? and now it is time for you to bring your wisdom into play~
the sino @-@ __name1__ war and the civil war of china were stirred up by __name2__ , and __name2__ has the ability to force china to send troops to __name3__ ? nonsense !
for __name1__ , __name1__ and __name2__ have the biggest relationship in the world , and the sino @-@ us relationship is a trade @-@ off relationship .
in the most recent visit to the __name1__ by __name3__ , which is an exercise before he becomes the top official in __name2__ , the primary topic discussed was mutually beneficial economic cooperation of the two sides .
the __name1__ @-@ __name2__ relationship is very complicated . economically , the __quant1__ sides are partners on unequal footings ,
politically , it is a relationship between __name1__ and capitalism ; militarily , __name2__ and __name3__ militaries are in an isolated state .
therefore , currently __name1__ is playing games with the __name2__ , i.e. how to offset the latter __quant1__ relationships with economic cooperation .
next is a brief analysis of the main strategy of __name1__ 's visit to the __name2__ :
first , what is the biggest puzzle between __name1__ and the __name2__ ?
the biggest puzzle in front of __name1__ is how to maintain its relationship with the __name2__ as it becomes increasingly powerful .
to __name1__ , it cannot fall out with the __name2__ .
if __name1__ falls out with the __name2__ , then it will seriously consumes china 's strengths and will be very unfavorable for future development of china ,
because __name1__ will lose the situation of peaceful development internationally , such that __name3__ has to cope with not only the powerful military threat posed by the __name2__ , but also complicated relations in the neighboring areas . this will seriously consume __name3__ energy for development .
therefore , on the premise of not falling out with the __name2__ , __name1__ , on the one hand , still has to maintain relationship with the __name2__ , while on the other hand , it has to precaution against the dirty tricks that the us plays on __name1__ .
second , it is not time yet to be tough to the __name1__ .
some believe that __name1__ should be tough to the __name3__ . is the __name3__ someone that yields to hawkishness ?
in the soviet union era , it got in a race for hegemony against the __name1__ , where both sides were so tough that they became enemies , which provided the __name1__ the opportunity to break up thoroughly with the __name2__ .
as the __name1__ does not need the __name2__ to exist as a great power , the __name1__ could attack the __name2__ and tackle the ussr without any hesitation .
the road __name1__ is going along at present is one where the __quant1__ sides are intertwined with each other , such that the __name2__ also suffers great loss when attacking and imposing sanctions on __name1__ .
what 's more , many businesspeople in the __name1__ also come out to oppose the government 's behaviors . __name2__ will be able to truly rise as long as it can keep on for __quant1__ years .
as the ancient saying goes , a gentleman can afford to wait for as long as __quant1__ years to avenge . if __name1__ falls out with the us too early , it will put itself in a very disadvantaged position .
although we are strong today , it 's not time yet to fight the final battle with the __name1__ .
third , the __quant1__ phases that the __name1__ @-@ __name2__ relationship will go through .
it is not advisable to fight a major war in the __name1__ 's dealings with the __name2__ .
the author believes the __quant1__ sides could only undergo __quant2__ phases . the __value1__ is a period which sees __name1__ grow in strength and the __name2__ feel seriously threatened .
the __value1__ stage is when __name1__ has become strong , the __name2__ is no longer certain about winning a war with __name1__ , such that it has no choice than to cooperate in order to obtain more benefits .
to avoid war between __name1__ and the __name2__ , it appears extremely important to carry out exchanges between the __quant1__ peoples .
next let 's have a look at survey results of __name1__ view towards __name2__ :
an opinion poll of a __name1__ website shows that __value1__ % of the people believe __name2__ and the us are " allies , " __value2__ % think they are " friendly but not allies , " and __value3__ % believe they are " enemies ."
survey results also show that __value1__ % of the __name2__ believe __name1__ @-@ __name2__ relations are " very important or somewhat important , " while the proportion is __value2__ % in opinion leaders .
on the __day1__ th , the __name1__ said that in an opinion poll it conducted jointly with the __name3__ , __value1__ % of the respondents saw __name2__ in a negative way .
this result reflects __quant1__ urgent issues . first , __name1__ is not that bad in the mind of __name2__ people , and there is still environment and scope to continue expanding exchanges .
second , if __name1__ and the __name2__ do not handle their relations properly , lacking in communications between its peoples and the foundation or friendship , then the chinese and __name2__ peoples may turn hostile .
therefore , the __name1__ and __name2__ peoples must enhance cooperation and bring the two sides closer through economic cooperation , so as to offset the discrepancies brought by military and politics .
however , it is undeniable that serious conflicts remain between __name1__ and the __name2__ in some important areas .
for instance : the __name1__ issue ; human rights and democracy ; __name2__ ; __name3__ ; proliferation of weapons of mass destruction ; __name4__ ; geopolitics and military strategy ; trade and currency ; intellectual property rights and internet spies .
these puzzles cannot be overcome with the __quant1__ characters of friendship alone . after all it involves major interests .
so it is no secret to the __quant1__ sides . just like vice president __name2__ counts on the __name3__ to oppose __name4__ independence and __name5__ , how could __name1__ count on a geopolitical enemy ?
national presidents are all masters in politics , who know what 's at stake . however , what should be said should be said . the thing is if the __name1__ has said something , it will break its words if it does n't do what it said , which will show to people in the world that the __name1__ is immoral and its words do n't count .
anyway , between __name1__ and the __name2__ in the future , whoever is a better strategist and whoever comes up with more sophisticated strategy wins .
it requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy . you can only fight a __quant1__ wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
this view tells us a fact that one will earn respect by developing military force
the cannons are thicker
it requires wisdom to be friends with an enemy . you can only fight a __quant1__ wars without defeat only if you know yourself and the enemy well .
chairman __name1__ has said a long time ago : one will be beaten if he @/@ she is backward . only development is of overriding importance !
it is fun ? they are ordering the dog they feed at home to bark at you , yet you have gone to shake hands with them , looking for slaps
it is fun ? they are ordering the dog they feed at home to bark at you , yet you have gone to shake hands with them , looking for slaps
brainwash the __name1__ people on behalf of the __name2__ .
brainwash the __name1__ people on behalf of the __name2__ .
is it the __name1__ system that 's superior or the __name2__ system that 's superior after all ?
i think __name1__ and the mainland are already distinguishing relative superiority or inferiority between them . the thread starter should take a look outside the country more
you look but not see the zg 's chaos in society , or is it voluntary blindness !
i also feel that there are more modern " traitors of __name1__ " than during __name2__ .
everyone has eyes , look at the living situations of __name1__ and __name2__ - do you still not understand ?
venture exchange ,
if i take care of myself , that 's good enough , when the country needs me , i 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness
if these traitors of __name1__ existed around __quant1__ , __quant2__ years ago , they would already have been executed by firing squad .
to make a conclusion , you must have something to demonstrate it
i do n't have time to go searching
i wish lz would explain them one by one ...
their property and families are all outside of the country , of course they will , just like the officials .
when the country needs me , i 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness
i can just take a look , and dare not to speak my mind , the police can grab people , thread starter , i admire you for daring to speak ! bump !
the ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of __name1__ !
comrade __name1__ once said that the __name2__ will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself .
former __name2__ ambassador to __name3__ __name1__ once said in a speech in the __name2__ : we will raise __quant1__ spokespeople in __name3__ , let the chinese themselves topple china -
and the __name1__ then used __quant2__ __quant1__ yuan subsidy to help these domestic so @-@ called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsiders use us .
in the summer of __year1__ , a picture that people have long been looking forward to started emerging with frequency in various major __name1__ media .
with their unique charm , these well - known cartoon images once again caused __name1__ to be a focus of worldwide attention .
the world 's __value1__ __name1__ park will soon open to the public here .
the most important thing about __name1__ is that it is a global brand .
well , for several years , although it was still under construction and , er , not yet open , it can be said that many people have viewed __name1__ with new respect .
then welcome to the official writing ceremony of __name1__ .
the construction of __name1__ began __quant1__ years ago , in __year1__ .
in __month1__ of that year , the __name1__ government turned over to __name3__ __quant1__ hectares of land at the foot of __name2__ that was obtained following the largest land reclamation project in recent years .
one .
since then , this area has become a prohibited zone in __name1__ .
as its neighbor on __name2__ , __name1__ had to change its flight routes to make this area a no - fly zone .
__name1__ 's new home , settling on __name2__ land for the __value1__ time , has captured worldwide attention .
there 's only __quant1__ month left before the opening of __name1__ on __month1__ __day1__ .
the subway to __name1__ has already been constructed .
at subway stations , passengers will frequently press the station for __name1__ on ticket machines , trying to purchase tickets to enjoy the park when it __value1__ opens .
meanwhile , the __name1__ subway station is scheduled to open on the same day as the park .
for __quant1__ years , __name1__ has constantly maintained its mystery .
no media have been allowed to enter for photos .
we took a taxi along the path of the highway that heads toward disney , trying to experience this mysterious park from close by .
however , before any of the disney symbols were in sight , the car was stopped by a security guard at the intersection of the road towards __name1__ .
on our way back , the taxi driver gave us an explanation after understanding our intentions .
er , according to what the security guard said , for the time before everything is officially opened , opened , all , no cars can enter unless they have special permission .
no one can enter otherwise .
video recording is especially forbidden .
ah , everything is top secret .
if pictures are taken without permission , %pw that is to say , it will at all times be pursued by legal action , a big hassle .
although __name1__ chose __name2__ as the venue for the __name4__ __name3__ park , what they are actually most excited about is the mainland china tourist market .
since the implementation of the __name2__ between hong kong and the mainland , more and more mainland tourists are coming to visit __name1__ .
from the beginning up till now , more than seven million individual tourists have , have come to __name1__ .
well , we now , er , believe more will be coming .
at this point , it has been about __quant1__ years .
also , the current number of 34 cities will be increased .
__name1__ was developed from a fishing harbor __quant1__ years ago to become today 's international metropolis .
here , __name1__ and __name2__ cultures have gathered , and the new and the old coexist .
when in __name2__ , you can wander among skyscrapers , heartily enjoy shopping sprees in well - known stores and malls for goods from various countries , and taste delicious snacks from all over the world at tea shops or at street stands in __name1__ .
you can go to burn incense and make a vow at the __name1__ , where all deities gather .
you can enjoy the most charming sun - filled sandy beaches in __name1__ .
you can ascend __name1__ to get a panoramic view of __name2__ 's beautiful scenery .
or hop onto a trolley with over __quant1__ century of history , and feel the city 's blend of the old and the modern in slow motion .
after dark , cruise __name1__ at night to enjoy the enchanting evening view .
every corner of __name1__ is filled with fun .
meanwhile , as various new items are constantly being added , what other kinds of pleasant surprises will the __name1__ tourism industry bring us ?
over the past __quant1__ years , the __name1__ has basically been a must - see destination for tourists coming to __name2__ .
watch spectacular performances by dolphins and sea lions at the ocean theater , and experience passionate screaming and accelerating heart - beat adventures on amusement rides .
or ride the giant __name1__ wheel to get a bird 's eye view from high above of the magnificent panorama of __name2__ and the __name3__ .
these items , which were the pride of the __name1__ , have made this place the most popular tourist attraction in __name2__ for some time .
however , since __name2__ entered __name3__ , the __name1__ , sharing the same city as __name2__ , has felt the pressure of competition .
to improve the park 's brand , they are planning to invest __quant1__ in a renovation project starting in __year1__ .
it seems that for the future , we have a scheme , a major renovation plan .
that is , the entire park will be divided into __quant1__ sections for renovation .
ah , additional , newer , ah , attractions will be available for tourists .
it seems that those attractions like the __name1__ and the marine life center will also be renovated after several years .
are they going to be different from what they are now ?
they will be , in __quant1__ years .
ah , there will be more animals , and more animal species , different from what there is now .
it looks like we will also bring in whales .
er , we will implement this plan as soon as it is approved by the government .
groundbreaking is expected to start next year .
yes .
the area of __name1__ is only __quant1__ - plus square kilometers .
the population is dense .
natural resources are relatively scarce .
however , the clever __name1__ people will utilize all resources they have created for developing the hong kong tourism industry .
among these is the __name1__ .
entering hollywood of the east ,
here , you can come up close with the stars in your mind .
he is my .
she is my __name1__ , ah .
please stay with us on new world travel .
__name1__ has always worn the crown of hollywood of the east .
over the past __quant1__ years of film history , __name1__ cinema has nurtured many internationally renowned directors , actors , and screenwriters .
they have shortened the distance between __name1__ and the world .
hong kong movies have even become a window for the world to see hong kong , which have made the image of metropolitan __name1__ more prominent internationally .
for this reason , in __year1__ , on __name2__ __name4__ originally constructed for viewing only __name2__ scenery of __name5__ and __name6__ , __name2__ __name1__ also constructed __name2__ , memorializing __name3__ 's __quant1__ - year film history .
here , tourists can learn about __name1__ 's film history , and can come up close with the stars in their mind .
__name1__ is a busy metropolis .
even at dusk , the city 's pulse never stops beating .
across from __name1__ , a special performance is staged every weekend .
%pw as our __name1__ is %pw very famous , and , er , our nightscape is already very beautiful , by what means could we enhance the dynamic beauty of our nightscape ?
so , __quant1__ idea was to transform __name1__ into a performance stage .
er , each key building is like a performer .
it is based on this that music and lights are arranged to reflect each other and perform a unique , er , and fascinating multi @-@ media world - class light show .
let me now introduce to you all the well - known skyscrapers participating in this large - scale light and music show .
the pla hong kong garrison plaza , __name1__ , at 8 @:@ __time1__ every saturday night , __name2__ .
their performances will be on schedule .
center of the __name1__ .
__quant1__ landmark buildings located on __name1__ reveal themselves one by one , participating in the show in full splendor , presenting a world - class light extravaganza to a musical rhythm .
whenever there is a major event or holiday , fireworks are also added to the light show .
some , er , cities have consulted with us .
uh @-@ huh .
their area of surprise was that those private , er , buildings , that is , the business community , ah , is willing to invest in our overall project .
yes .
the answer is that this is a reward to the entire society , not an individual building 's reward .
er , of course , after sars , we felt that all of __name1__ hopes to be involved , so that the hong kong tourism industry will recover , rebound together with other sectors .
__name1__ , which is currently under construction , is also one of the designated new projects of the __name2__ government for advancing the hong kong tourism industry .
this is a park intimately connected with nature , being built by the __name1__ government for its people who live in a city of reinforced concrete .
__name1__ covers an area of __quant1__ hectares , including a __quant2__ square meter visitor 's center and a __quant3__ hectare outdoor wildlife habitat .
in the indoor exhibition hall , tourists can learn about types of wetlands in various parts of the world , and to gain knowledge about wetlands .
outdoors , they can also personally experience wetland ecology .
at the highest point of __name1__ , er , from the highest point we can see __quant1__ different ecological environments .
ha , on that side are many tall buildings , that is , towns with lots of people living there ,
but behind me is our __name1__ .
ha , entirely different .
quite primitive ,
er , a fresh water swamp ,
er , the wetland park exploration center .
lastly , farthest away you can see __name1__ of __name2__ .
then , the bridge is , on the bridge is __name1__ and outside is __name2__ .
you can come into intimate contact with nature in the outdoor wetland environment .
children can get to know different animals and plants , and even some crops that are rarely seen in our __quant1__ life .
over here are paddy fields , which is rather unique .
ha , there are aquatic plants inside .
ah , the most special is rice , because %pw many __name1__ children nowadays have never seen what rice looks like .
look over there .
they are going to be ripe soon .
the long one over there .
oh .
yes .
with , with ears , ah .
where ?
ah , here .
perhaps there will be an introduction so that children will know the names of the crops when they see them .
let , let them get some understanding .
__name1__ adjacent to __name2__ is a major wildlife habitat within __name3__ .
each year , over 50,000 migratory birds fly over __name1__ 's skyscrapers and choose to roost for winter here .
as a result , __quant1__ different types of aviaries were built in __name1__ .
these have become the best spots to observe birds .
among common birds , a rather special one is the black - faced spoonbill .
it is an endangered bird species throughout the world .
uh @-@ huh .
ah , there are only about 1,500 in the world .
wow .
um , however , each year , about two to three hundred of them come to __name1__ to spend the winter .
some of them , er , have stayed in __name1__ .
uh @-@ huh .
so , our park 's logo is unique , featuring this black - faced spoonbill , which hopefully can draw people 's attention .
uh @-@ huh .
__name1__ workers are now in the middle of intensive work .
they will complete the park 's entire construction by the beginning of __year1__ , to be able to participate in the 2006 discover hong kong year campaign .
ah , we have established the year __year1__ as discover hong kong year .
why is that ?
because , as everyone knows , our __name1__ will open in __month1__ of this year .
in addition , we will have __name1__ , that is , the cable car , er , to the __name2__ .
they add to what we already have , like the __name1__ , which is also very famous .
moreover , er , we are including our software .
__name1__ 's software is very well known .
like what 's used in our __name1__ .
we hope to use , er , a variety of hardware and software to package this entire __year1__ discover hong kong year .
without planning it in advance , they chose to settle here .
a dream that has been anticipated for more than __quant1__ years will soon come true here .
because your line connects us with __quant1__ --
in recent years , __name1__ 's tourist attractions have gradually moved from __name2__ to __name3__ and the __name4__ .
__quant1__ out of the __quant2__ new attractions participating in the __year1__ discover hong kong year are located on __name1__ of the __name2__ .
for this reason , __name1__ has become a new __name2__ tourism popular spot .
the earliest to settle here was this world 's largest outdoor seated bronze __name1__ .
in __name2__ __name1__ , there are __quant1__ directions - east , west , south , north , and center - and __quant2__ buddhas .
therefore , __name2__ 's __name1__ at the most southern tip of __name3__ , together with __name4__ in the east , __name5__ giant __name7__ in the west , __name6__ in the north , and __name7__ giant __name7__ in the __name8__ , exist as the representative buddhas for each of the __quant1__ directions of china .
as a result , this place has become holy land in the hearts of male and female devotees .
however , to common tourists , more of what this place brings them is wonder and awe .
since this giant bronze __name4__ settled on __name5__ , the world renowned __name1__ at __name2__ and __name3__ have also been constructed here in succession .
the important status of __name1__ is increasingly apparent .
no , it was totally inaccessible in the past .
in the near future , construction will also begin on a cross @-@ sea bridge connecting __name1__ , __name2__ , and __name3__ .
in __year1__ --
could n't go in summer --
so , after their return , __name1__ , and __name2__ , the __quant1__ special administrative regions , are basically still using ships and helicopters to stay connected .
it 's extremely troublesome to get there via land .
one has to go up to __name1__ , __name2__ , then go through __name3__ , keep going up , to __name4__ , and certainly go to __name5__ , then pass through zhuhai to get to __name6__ .
for a __name1__ person choosing to go there via land , it 's extremely inconvenient .
a full __quant1__ years ago , __name1__ chairman wu ying - sheung , a well - known construction tycoon , boldly made a cross @-@ sea bridge proposal .
with this bridge , the distance would be very small , only a little over __quant1__ kilometer .
however , due to various reasons , bridge construction was put off .
this is what we have seen since __year1__ .
anticipated for __quant1__ years , today this dream is finally coming true .
well , originally the construction of the new --
with this new hong kong - zhuhai - macao bridge that basically leads to all three places , __name1__ , __name3__ , and __name2__ , basically , at the start of the bridge , you can get on the separate road to the place you want to go .
__name1__ is this way , and __name2__ is this way .
from the perspective of either __name1__ , __name2__ , or __name3__ , our concept is a tourism zone .
er , %pw __name1__ for sightseeing tours , __name2__ for entertainment , and we have __name3__ and other , other attractions in __name4__ .
each place has different attractions of its own .
so , with this bridge , when some old friends , friends from mainland __name1__ or from foreign countries come to our place , it seems they can basically enjoy a complete tour with great convenience in several days , before , ha , going home .
__quant1__ the __name3__ - __name3__ - __name3__ is built , it will no longer be a dream of tourists to enjoy gourmet food in __name1__ before having fun at __name2__ just __quant1__ hour later .
promotion of __name1__ has long since begun .
however , even though it has entered the __value1__ countdown period before its final opening , this wonderland is still unwilling to take off its mysterious veil .
ah , currently it has been decided that disney will open on __month1__ __day1__ .
there 's also what we call soft opening .
ah , they are now rehearsing .
ah , different , ah , some groups , they are rehearsing their service , well , hoping that they will become used to the service , be familiar with it , when our tourists come in __month1__ .
well , i am very confident , that when our tourists come to __name1__ , they will certainly return home very satisfied .
the wonder tour will start from __name1__ .
this dynamic metropolis never ceases its movement .
it continues to explore ; it continues to open new worlds .
each day , there is always something new for people to experience and to love about this city .
__name1__ is a world famous shopping paradise .
what determined the position of __name1__ as a shopping paradise ?
is it because of abundant merchandise or high quality at low prices ?
is it a paradise for the rich or the general public ?
after all , what are the joyful memories from inside paradise ?
we respectfully invite you to watch hong kong : a shopping paradise in this edition of __name1__ .
hello , everyone .
this is the cross strait program on __name1__ .
welcome to our program .
first let 's focus on the main contents of today 's program .
__name1__ - __name1__ says that he has decided not to continue serving as __name2__ vice chairman .
candidates for the giant pandas to be presented to __name1__ as gifts from the mainland may increase .
__name1__ 's military uses taipei aerospace exhibition as an opportunity for pressing arms procurement .
recently , the __year1__ ningxia investment and trade fair and ningxia - taiwan economic and trade cooperation seminar were held in the city of __name1__ .
more than three hundred __name1__ businesspeople gathered in this land known as " lush southern - type fields north of the __name2__ , " beginning their tour and inspection journey .
well , what is the unique charm in __name2__ of the western region that has attracted the attention of so many __name1__ businesspeople ?
please watch this edition of hot topic analysis for a detailed report .
the __name1__ vice chairman arrived at party headquarters to meet with kmt chairman __name2__ on the afternoon of %pw .
after a long talk of over __quant1__ hour , __name1__ - __name1__ expressed his wish not to renew his term as __name2__ vice chairman .
he said that he will follow __name1__ as a lifelong volunteer .
%pw
he can n't seem to help himself from apologizing for anything and everything .
__name1__ could make a fortune off of this guy .
i do n't follow , why should he apologize to __name1__ ?
did __name1__ apologize to __name2__ ?
he needs to conduct a beer summit between __name1__ and __name2__ .
mend some fences and get this country moving .
he could call it the apologies on beer tour .
hell , sell tickets and hire the __name1__ to cater the event .
who drops out after __name1__ ?
i think __name1__ wins big today and obviously stays in .
__name1__ gets enough of a boost to do the __name2__ hangs around .
i think __name1__ 's sole win in __name2__ is enough to hang it up and go back to making __quant1__ in the private sector .
i think the __name1__ is too crazy to hang it up .
i will stick around until the end .
no one
i think __name1__ drops out ...
ok , my answer is no one and __name1__ wins the __name2__ .
the only one with any reason to will be __name1__ , but i do n't think that he will .
__name1__ says tornado victims should not get aid
nuts .
my heart goes out to the people in tornado alley and i have no problem with my tax dollars going to help the survivors rebuild their lives .
if you have no problem with your tax dollars going to aid them then you 'd have no problem donating to them of your own free will .
not to mention that he 's absolutely right that they should have insurance to cover them .
__name1__ is not quite bright .
he 's right in some ways but it does n't translate into being right across the board .
this is n't like someone 's house burning down and they make an insurance claim .
everything is gone , the entire infrastructure is gone .
even if someone has insurance to cover their loss , that won't extend to the roads , power lines , sewers , public buildings .
the problem with this regime is aid is not distributed equally .
__name1__ get it , minorities get it , white __name2__ jurisdictions do n't .
aid is now patronage , good party members get it .
is n't it interesting how libertarians ' desire for " freedom " correspond so neatly with skinflints who do n't want to give anyone , anything .
so while libertarianism attracts people who want to be " free " it also attracts cheap assholes who do n't want to pay their fair share .
perhaps when libertarians figure out a way to differentiate between the two , i 'll vote for them .
i get what __name1__ is saying .
thats what a hardcore libertarian would say .
but the rest of us are thinking about the people that do not have insurance and @/@ or need help right now .
kind of hard to build a house over night , mr __name1__ .
kind of hard to import food considering that the stores are probably wiped out too .
how does one survive until the insurance( hopefully by a respectable company ) claim comes through ?
how does one survive when you have the funds but the people you need to buy the goods from has no address ?
i know , you get into your pickup and drive over to the next town -- if you can find your damn pickup ! !
homeowners generally have insurance , but federal aid is necessary to provide for the clean up , repairs of electrical and water systems , roads , schools , buses , etc. etc.
keep in mind insurance companies are not in the business of paying claims , they are in the business of making money .
anyone who suffers a loss as have those who lost everything over the weekend will not be made whole , and whatever claim they receive will not come soon or easy .
__name1__ and his libertarian ideas are at best impractical .
no surprise there .
he had to win there to stay in , so ultimately this helps __name1__ keep the vote split .
best outcome of the night would have been __name1__ losing there .
he 's a nonfactor at this point and only in out of spite .
if he were out of the race , __name1__ might have had a chance .
the __name1__ is opposed to contraception for moral reasons .
where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities ?
where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent ?
where is the morality when disease is spread ?
where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence ?
when a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control ?
i am with you .
if you cant feed , house and take care of a baby you have no business having one .
why is it literally __value1__ % impossible for the liberal mind to understand that just because you do n't want government involved in something does n't mean you 're against it ?
i 'm in favor of feeding , clothing , and giving shelter to the poor . i 'm against all the gov't institutions that tax our brains out and who inefficiently attempt to provide some of these things .
now am i just a genius who does n't know it , or is it really not that hard to understand such a simple concept ?
will they try to prop __name1__ up with a strong vp to help make him more palatable - or will they bring in a new face ?
either way , they 've got a big problem .
are n't you one of the assholes who assured us how __name1__ was inevitable as the __name2__ nominee ?
i do n't think __name1__ will tank , its going to be a close one till the very end , i am still rooting for a __name2__ @/@ __name3__ ticket .
wow , another __name1__ @-@ type company who took our money and failed in their goal .
they laid off __quant1__ employees , but gave big raises to executives .
another scam that the media will ignore .
after seeing those bus tours to __name1__ execs homes , promoted on __name2__ 's website , i am wondering why those same people are n't outraged at this .
maybe because it would look bad for the guy who promises to pay their mortgages , put gas in their tanks , gave them free cell phones and increased the welfare rolls .
of course , the people on the __name1__ bus tours likely did n't get soaked with high taxes to pay for this scam , so why should they care ?
this is not surprising or shocking to me .
__name1__ must pay off his supporters by way of cash infusions and call it " stimulus " money .
he is not lying to call it stimulus .
it stimulates others to be big contributors so they may be in on the next wave of free cash from the boy king .
another victory for the left because there are more people in need .
the government will rush in and show these people that government dependency is better than working and providing for themselves .
that is the plan with all the liberal policies .
no one should be expected to practice self sufficiency or concern themselves with personal responsibility .
increase the welfare rolls till the takers outweigh the givers . only then can __name1__ creep in .
everything __name1__ has done is straight from __name3__ 's __name2__ . all of it .
if some on the left want to remain ignorant and not read alinky 's book to prove it , that is on them .
for those in the know , this was all quite predicable .
dumb , dumb dumb ...
i 've always been a critic of judges who decide they are going to disregard the will of legistlatures and the populace and impose these things , but here 's a case where they did it the right way ,
they passed a bill , and __name1__ decides he 's stull sucking up to be __name2__ 's running mate .
__name1__ is being set up on this one and the legislature called his bluff
it will make him a big shot with the __name1__ in __year1__ but by __year2__ if he were to run for president " __name2__ vetoed gay marriage " will be a millstone around his neck .
by __year1__ most __name1__ will have gay marriage available .
christies denial of marriage privleges to gays will alienate independents and his " i wanted to have the people vote on it " will ring hollow
it is __name1__ that is the by far major nonromney candidate and __name2__ would appear to be the spoiler .
when the situation was reversed __name1__ argued that __name2__ was helping __name3__ get the nomination and for the good of the conservative cause __name2__ should drop out .
now that the same logic would apply to __name1__ dropping out , should he ?
sure , why not .
i think __name1__ is going to be the __value1__ of the " not romneys ", and __name2__ has had his moment .
who know . he may make a comeback .
of course money is a problem for him so he may have to drop out .
__name1__ or __name2__ . i could vote for either one .
no , why should he ?
he is , if nothing else , insuring that he 'll be able to sell books after the election .
i mean you do n't really think that any of these guys really give a shit about their party or their nation , do ya ?
more than they care about themselves , i mean .
__name1__ ' assessment __name1__ __name2__ has hit a new low , with __value1__ % saying they approve of the way congress is handling its job .
the __value1__ % disapproval rating is also the worst __name1__ has measured in more than __quant1__ years of tracking __name2__ job performance .
ever notice that the more gridlock there is , the more __name1__ ' ratings go down .
in other words , __name1__ should stop all the politcal bickering , put their heads together and start working things out in a real bi @-@ partisan format .
it worked for __name1__ and __name2__ and look at the positive results .
i 'm not the least bit surprised .
i 'm still waiting for __name1__ to drain the damned swamp .
today on the __name3__ floor __name1__ said healthcare premiums will not go down and that the __name2__ needs to quit saying that ! !!!
then __name1__ in the __name3__ said we need to pass the __name2__ so " we can find out what 's in it....."
the __name1__ are slowy turning __name2__ into __name3__ 's bigtop circus ! !!!!
the insurance industry 's own institute said premiums would skyrocket .
how could they not ?
if you force them to accept pre @-@ existing conditions and accept other insured 's currently not eligible because they cost too much , who is going to pay for that extra risk ?
you can n't legislate risk away . of course premiums will rise .
the administration is in campaign mode , willing to say or do anything to get this turd passed .
the joke will be on __name1__ dems who are being promised a bill to " fix " the problems with teh __name2__ bill .
anyone who believes that will happen is dreaming .
__name1__ will hang them out to dry .
1 . ending the war in __name1__
2 . developing __name1__ energy independence
3 . universal healthcare for all __name1__
works for me ......
only if that means it is over because we won .
and we will have some very strategically located , large bases to counter __name1__ and __name2__ agression for the next __quant1__ years .
a good thing , but he will have to include things he opposes , like drilling and nuclear power , along with coal power to get there .
only if he adopts __name1__ 's plan of mandatory universal participation .
which means everyone , without exception , pays premiums .
here are the things that should be __name1__ 's top priorities .
#1 ending the war in __name1__
#2 bringing us universal healthcare
#3 repealing __name1__
#4 repealing the __name1__
#5 repealing __name1__ @-@ __name1__
#6 bringing __name1__ @/@ __name2__ up on criminal charges for war crimes . ( send them to __name3__ haig ! !!)
#7 fire __name1__ !
#8 strengthen the __name1__
#9 abolish the __name1__ !
#10 prosecute __name1__ !
what about when my favorite doctor quits because he is not going to take a pay cut ?
or just lets the quality of his practice go down the tubes ?
also , who is going to goto school for __quant1__ years to be a doctor , with major student loans and only make a sub @-@ par government salary ?
i 'll tell ya what , if were going to goto school for __quant1__ years , it would be for rocket science or computer engineering or something of that nature so i could easily make an above average salary .
__value1__ and most importantly , i never want to see any of my paycheck support some lazy person who does not work because the government pays for them to live their life .
i plan on voting against every single one of these dirtbags that call themselves representatives .
our __name1__ , be it the __name2__ or __name3__ , are a bunch of non @-@ representing representatives .
its as if the __name2__ __name1__ were in charge once again doing whatever is best for themselves irregardless of the consitution .
i say kick them all out of office , and then do it again every election for the next several cycles until they get the hint .
we are not happy , we are not gonna take it anymore ! !!!
am i the only one or are some of you feeling like this too ?
i 'm not a republican , i 'm not a democrat , i am an __name1__ ! !!!!
start respecting my country , my consitution , and our national heritage or get fired @/@ voted out .
add your __quant1__ cents people .
i 'll have a senator to vote for along with my representative , and senator __name1__ is not running in __year1__ so i 'll luckily have more options to vote for .
so far there are __quant1__ candidates in the race that i 'm aware of , and i 'm not impressed by any of them .
but hopefully somebody good pops up that i can support .
as far as my representative goes , i can n't wait to vote against him .
i do n't vote ' against ' anyone .
i vote ' for ' the best candidate for the job , regardless of political affiliation ( unless , of course , they are un @-@ american , like libtards and neocons ) .
since none of the incumbents in my district will get my vote , i guess you could say i 'm voting ' against ' them , but i 'm still not comfortable with that term .
where would __name1__ be without __name2__ ?
a lot of us , including myself , have had fun poking , jabbing , making fun of __name1__ , her lack of knowledge about the constitution , her appearance on __name2__ , etc....
but at this late date in the race ...
where would he , ( __name1__ ) , be if he did not have her as his running mate
imo .... she is helping him more now , because he is hurting himself , more .
__name1__ solidified the __name2__ base for __name3__ .
she invigorated the far right wingers to actually go out and campaign for __name1__ , instead of apathetically voting for mccain to spite __name2__ .
__name1__ is the real star behind the __name2__ ticket this year .
if it were anyone else , __name1__ would not have a shot in hell .
__name1__ invigorated __name2__ 's campaign , and she is one of the reasons __name2__ raised $ __quant1__ dollars in __month1__ .
when i saw her speech at the convention , i immediately sent __name1__ as much money as i could .
presidential candidates : __name1__ ( c ) __name2__ __name3__ ( l ) __name4__ __name5__ ( __name12__ ) __name7__ ( g ) __name8__ __name9__ ( i ) __name10__ __name11__ ( __name12__ )
looks like women have a candidate running for president .
why are n't women flocking to her ?
what 's wrong with the __name1__ ?
the woman is a nutjob .
she would make __name1__ look like __name2__ .
why on earth would women vote for the __name1__ just because they have a female candidate ?
sorry , i would n't have voted for __name1__ , either .
i would vote for __name1__ or __name2__ .
the __name1__ is the party for the libtards who are too crazy even for other libtards .
if the government provides health care , whether spelled out in this bill or not , it will ration the care .
that is how it works .
the government can not afford to pay for everything for everyone , even if they took all our money .
and in fact the research that backs up this health care bill out of the __name1__ spells it out clearly .
specifically it identifies the elderly and those under the age of __quant1__ as being less important and so they will be the __value1__ to suffer from reduced services .
knowing that the government can not efficiently run anything , i can promise it won't end there .
since all healthcare is rationed , the question for me is do i want those decisions to rest with corporations whose sole reason for existence is to make a profit --- profits which depend upon insuring the healthiest among us , and denying coverage for those whom they may have to pay claims ?
corporations where profits are dependent on not providing the services i pay for ?
that can at any point in time decide to cancel my policy , leaving me without any coverage at all and no prospects of obtaining coverage on my own ?
that spend 1 @/@ 3 of their revenue in administrative overhead ?
i have not seen much cold weather , or snow , here in the northeast .
meterologist say this will be a warmer than usual winter this year .
many temperatures have been above what is normal for this time of year .
is this winter weather going to be what winters will be like in the future.?
warmer temperatures.?
is what global warming is about.?
hey stupid , __name1__ 's getting __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ inches of snow tonight .
when it snowed in __month1__ it was global warming too
52 nd __name1__ all up in the white .
i see mr. biker boys . thanks for letting me know .
whats the name of that motor cycle gang you belong to ? ?
its warmer , therefore global warming
it 's snowing , therefore global warming
when will it be too late to do anything about global warming ?
have we already guaranteed our doom ?
so you are a warmist too ehh ?
sorry to hear .
the facts .... from about __year1__ to __year2__ we had a __quant1__ @/@ __quant1__ of a degree warming period .
this started the man made global warming claim .
another inconvenient fact for the man made global warming crowd . since __year1__ until today there has been no significant warming .
a further fact . in the early __century1__ 's scientists predicted that over the next __quant2__ years the temperature would go up globally about __quant1__ degree . and that is what it did .
so we had an __quant2__ year trend that saw a rise of __quant1__ @/@ __quant1__ of a degree world wide . followed to date by a __quant3__ year period with no appreciable warming . remind me again how we are all doomed ?
experiencing the great platonic year .
precission of the __name1__ equinox refers to the earth 's axis wobble moving in an unconventional way .
time period event is a __quant1__ yrs wobble path .
notice the ice cap weight shifting it is due to __name1__ own inertia and the sun moon alignment .
this vid indicates inertia shifts in ice not to be due to global warming but due to physics of the __name1__ , sun , moon system .
this inertia of the sun __name1__ moon generates potential physical plate movements on earth , ie earthquakes .
very cool stuff .
so is this because of global warming or is it __name1__ 's fault ?
it 's a good thing the polar ice cap is shrinking then right ?
this seems to explain the record snow fall in __name1__ and __name2__ .
nobody as yet really understands why periodically __name1__ undergoes geomagnetic reversal . but the wandering magnetic pole seems to have been happening for the last __quant1__ years .
happens regularly , and seems to have little effect on the biosphere as a whole .
no unusual events in the __name1__ record seem to be associated with magnetic reversals .
but everyone knows that what man makes doesnt count huh ?
not , i suspect , as it relates to magnetic pole shift or drift .
you just know that some ignorant fool is going to blame pollution .
this is really eye opening .
where are the environmentalists ?
have you seen the trash along the roads and in the ditches across this county ?
i see chairs couches refrigerators and who knows what else out here in the countryside .
people have no respect for their neighbors and i am talking about __name1__ here .
if they have no respect for their neighbors or fellow countrymen how can they have respect for themselves ?
its not everybody but a small segment of our society but the question is how small is this segment ?
now that is precisely what i am referring to .
instead of focusing on the filthy habits of illegals violating our border , you go one a mission to deflect .
not today , pal .
stay on point !
whole apartment was shaking .
far out and funky !
what the hell ?
two thumbs said he felt this too in pa .
nothing here in __name1__ though .
did you think earthquake at first ?
felt it here just outside of __name1__ , pa !
thought i was having a seizure or something at first , till i saw the water in my water bottle swaying back and forth .
the book shelf in my computer room was moving back and forth .
weird dude .
was going on for like __quant1__ seconds .
the time of water wars is upon us with the privatization of water resources worldwide by multinational conglomerates who are not accountable to , or suppressible by the local populations they effect , even here in __name1__ .
what say you ?
' __name1__ , ' a documentary on what the privatization of water really means which was the inspiration for me creating this thread .
it brings to light the insane and completely immoral behavior of water corporations ( __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , as well as __name4__ and __name5__ , and their involvement with the __name6__ ) ...
i am never going to buy another __name1__ , __name2__ , or __name3__ product until ...
i am dying of thirst , which is the situation many in the world find themselves in now .
allowing the privatization of public waters sources is stupid beyond all understanding .
water is resource of the commonweal and ought never to be allowed to become captured by any private concern .
right now corporations like nestles are buying up the world 's best springs to make bottled water .
allowing this to happen is a perfect example of how perverted our governments have become .
hey ........ __quant1__ years ago , i was reading about all kinds of hysterical doomsday theories of the extinction of this natural resource or that natural resource .
you get a few decades down the line and realize there are lots of smart people out there who roll out hysterical theories because they know there are millions of suckers out there who 'll buy it in a heartbeat and profit handsomely ftw ! !!
my wife works with the __name1__ a lot and she sent this report over to me .
they report on just how difficult it will be to regulate the amount of __name1__ being released .
__value1__
of course it will be difficult .
the energy companies are putting many , many __quant1__ of dollars into preventing anything at all from being done .
but we will probably start doing it well after it will make no differance .
our grandchildren will curse the blindness and greed of this generation .
i went to __name1__ and checked out the __name2__ oil crisis : all of the posts are __quant1__ month old , or older ...
how many million people post on __name1__ ?
the __value1__ __quant1__ months there were hundreds of private citizens with their video cams reporting about what was happening in the __name2__ ... showing everyone firsthand eyewitness accounts of the incompetence of __name1__ and the lack of government response .
now there are none : zero : nobody has posted __quant1__ single video on __name2__ about the __name1__ oil crisi for __quant2__ month .
this stinks to high heaven .
do n't tell me nobody has posted anything on the __name1__ crisis for __quant1__ month : there is a media bl ; ackouit going on .
the last time something like this happened that i know of ; was the __name3__ convention in __name1__ for the renomination of __name2__ for a __value1__ term in office .
would n't that be a __name1__ blackout , then ?
i mean , rather than a media blackout ?
__name1__ oil spill - google search = plenty of coverage about the oil spill still on the media .
that 's the point : the oil has not been cleaned up : its sunk below the surface : just like all the true facts have sunk out of sight .
the dispersant they used , __name1__ ; has destroyed all possibility of cleaning up the oil because it 's made the oil sunk below the surface .
__name1__ 's use of corexit is a quick way of sweeping the problem under the carpet : idiots who do n't see the oil on the surface will assume that there is n't any ecological damage going on .
instead , the ecological damage to the entire area is now a million times worse than it was when the oil was still on the surface .
the oil beneath the surface : __quant1__ and __quant1__ of gallons of oil is killing all wildlife , all the fish , all the dolphins , all the crabs , all the shrimp , everything .
to people who do n't live there : the horror of this catastrophe made worse by __name1__ cannot be understated enough .
yes you read that correctly .... lets just assign a number because we want too !
yeah that 's the ticket !
these clowns commit this fraudulent behavior all the fricking time and old fraud , chris , konradv , trolling blunder and a whole host of others ignore this .
what is so distorted in their fundamental makeup that they can see this desecration of science and ignore it ?
in fact they support and revere it .
bizarre .
yes , they have been extrapolating temps for areas where they had no direct measurement . however , as they stated , one should use the __name1__ measurements for those areas , if very accurate measurements are desired .
yet , for all of __name1__ yapping , none of this changes the fact that the warming continues , and differant agencies have better accuracy in some places than others , depending on the methods used .
another item concerning __name1__ .
he is not a meteorologist .
he is a fraud in that department .
tomorrow , the employment situation report comes out and as usual , there will be idiots claiming the government does n't count people not receiving unemployment benefits , or that the government is n't counting people who should be counted etc.
so let 's discuss .
question : what exactly do we want to measure and why ?
answer : we want to measure the labor market and how it is changing , especially how difficult it is to get a job .
first difficulty is that not everyone can freely participate in the labor market .
there are laws and barriers afffecting groups of people .
while children can work , there are significant restrictions as to field , hours , changing jobs etc.
at approx age __quant1__ the restrictions are gone , almost all jobs are open for full or part time work .
so we ignore anyone under __quant1__ .
next group are prisoners . while some " work " it 's not really a labor market system and working or not working are not free choices of entry and exit .
so we ignore prisoners .
next group are those mentally or physically incapable of working .
while many disabled and those with psychological conditions do work , those who are institutionalized or in long term care ( such as a hospice ) can n't .
so we ignore those in an institution or long term care .
there remains many disabled who can n't work but are n't in an institution , but since some can and some can n't work , there 's no bright line , so we include them all .
next : retirees .
many countries exclude those over the age of __quant1__ .
for a country with mandatory retirement , or generous government pensions , that is sensible as almost all those over 65 do n't need to work and do n't work and including them can distort the picture .
but in the __name1__ , there is no mandatory retirement ( except in military/police ) and retirement benefits are not as generous or universal .
so no maximum age limit for us .
last , military . for a while , they were counted as employed ( __year1__ @-@ __year2__ ) but since there 's no free exit and it 's not a market system , including them just raises the number of employed by a fairly constant level , so it 's better to exclude the military .
so we have our population : the adult civilian non @-@ institutional population .
how do we divide that up ?
the key is to be as objective as possible .
since we have to use a survey ( it 's just not possible to do a full count every month ) , any subjectivity will increase our error , so we have to avoid any possible overlaps or judgement calls .
let 's look at employed .
who is employed ?
some have suggested a minimum number of hours worked , but is that a good idea ?
plenty of people voluntarily work few hours , or in a particular week only work a few hours . should we say they do n't really have a job or are n't really working ?
that 's very subjecive . we do n't want to run into cases were someone nomrmally works __quant1__ hours __quant2__ week , but in the particular week of the survey she only worked __quant3__ hours and counted as unemployed .
so we set a bright line of __quant1__ hour for pay , and also include those as employed people temporarily absent due to brief illness , injury , vacation , strike , bad weather etc.
we can always look at sub groups later .
unpaid labor .
some people do n't get paid ( directly ) for work , either charity work or working on a family farm or family business .
let 's not include charity work , because that 's not really part of the labor market .
but family business @/@ farm is a different story ... the person is either just helping out , ( meaning if they do n't already have another job they would n't take one if they were n't working for family and @/@ or no one would have to be hired in their place ) or they are a substantial part of the business preventing them from another job and filling a job slot no one else can take .
so let 's set a bright line of __quant1__ hours __quant2__ week and anyone working without pay on family business farm __quant3__ hours or more __quant4__ week is employed .
what about someone hired but not yet working ?
many things can happen , so we won't call them employed until they 're actually working .
now for the unemployed .
in casual usage , this can mean many different things , but what we want is a precise , objective definition .
and what we 're looking for is available workers who are n't working .
this has an impact on the labor market..supply over demand .
some people do n't want to work ... retirees , housewives/husbands , full time students , and some people on drugs or alcohol or criminals or lazy .
so let 's not count anyone who does n't want a job .
should we count everyone who says they want a job ?
they could be lying .
they could be unable to take a job if offered ( meaning they 're not available labor ) .
so what bright line can we set ?
if someone is actually looking for work , sending a resume , going to an interview , on the union list , then we can safely assume that they are really available for work .
but if someone is n't doing anything about a getting a job , then they 're not available , anymore than someone who does n't want to work .
sure they may still consider themselves " unemployed " and they may sincerely want to work , but since they 're not available , since they 're not part of the actual supply of labor and can n't be hired , we exclude them .
so we have our employed , we have our unemployed .... this is our labor force , our available supply of people who can work or be hired .
everyone else is not in the labor force .
since the population tends to grow , for an historical comparison , it 's better to look at rates/ratios/percentages to get a clearer picture .
labor force participation rate : the labor force as a percent of the population .
this can be largely affected by non @-@ economic factors as the increase of women into the labor force in the 60 s and 70 s showed , but it gives a good look at how much of the population is trying to work .
employment @-@ population ratio : this tells us the percent of the population that 's actually working .
again , non @-@ economic factors play a role but looking at the changes can tell us useful things .
unemployment rate : unemployed as a percent of the labor force .
this tells us how much of available labor ... people willing and able and available to work ... is not being used .
this is all economic factors ... the percent of people trying and failing to get a job .
does this give a complete picture of the labor market ?
of course not ... it 's not meant to .
it does n't tell us types of job , if people are working as much as they want to , people who do n't believe they would be successful .
but it tells us what we 're looking for : the percent of people who we know for sure cannot get a job .
i think that explains the basics .
i 'll be happy to clarify questions or discuss any real issues .
the issue is simple , when 150k jobs are created and you need 250 to maintain ...
yet the ue rate goes down.2 % then you have a choice ...
you can make believe things are getting better or you can understand that things are getting worse and deal with it .
you chose to make believe .
neither side expects the other to be consistant .
i remember the libs making this argument during the __name1__ years .
of course , the real cuteness was during the __name1__ years during the run up to the __year1__ election when the military was added to the employed part of the picture .
presto , __quant1__ more employed persons and the unemployment rate when down by a substantial fraction .
that got quietly reversed after the election .
what is important here is that unemployment is no longer the short term thing it has usually been .
we have people looking for work who have been looking for __quant1__ years or more .
we have folks just plain resigning from the work force and do n't look any more .
people who __quant1__ years ago had successful careers .
even under the regime of __quant1__ week unemployment rather than __quant2__ week , we have large numbers who have gone beyond benefits .
to maintain what ?
and does " it " need to be maintained ?
or you can do actual analysis of the data .
" jobs " comes from the current employment statistics survey ( ces ) while unemployment ( and total employment ) comes from the __name1__ ( cps ) .
the ces is non @-@ farm payroll employment . it excludes agriculture , the self @-@ employed , unpaid family workers and private employees ( private cooks , nannies , maids , etc ) .
so " jobs " may go up 150k , but total employment goes up 300k .
you can n't directly compare __quant2__ measures that measure different things .
much of the drop in ue has been for the wrong reasons ... a decreasing labor force .
that was not the case for the __month1__ drop .
at best things have been spotty lately ... up and down .
you can n't just look at __quant1__ number or __quant2__ measure and say " things are good " or " things are bad ."
the best unit of measure is , i think to determine how many __name1__ are working .
instead we get reports on the number of people who self reported they are n't working but are looking for work .
to find out all we have to do is ask __name1__ and remember that __name2__ voted to the left of sanders while in the __name3__ .
__name1__ help us all if __name2__ ever got to appoint a liberal inflationist __name3__ chairman .
oh , and we might remember that when their __name2__ , __name1__ , was asked about the future consequencs of his ultra easy monetary policies he said , do n't worry about the future , we 'll all be dead .
__name1__ : another very important issue is with unemployment so high , how can we strengthen the fed 's full @-@ employment mandate [ with inflation ] and ensure that it conducts monetary policy to achieve maximum employment ? [ through inflation ] .
in other words the fed has a number of mandates and one of them is to control inflation .
but one of them also is to pursue policies that lead to full employment .
is the fed doing that in an adequate way ?
well i would argue that by definition when you have __value1__ % of people unemployed and underemployed it really is not .
they 'd do exactly what they 've done since __year1__ .
lend out " money " that does n't exist , charge interest for it , inflate the hell out of the currency and line their pockets in the process .
then , they 'd bankroll endless stupid foreign wars , the __name1__ welfare state , massive __name2__ schemes , endless bailouts of states , cities , corporations and foreign nations ....
the same thing a conservative fed would do , and then they 'd call it brilliant and give __name1__ the credit .
an __name1__ target can fix the unemployment problem without resulting in inflation .
that 's a gross misunderstanding of the __name1__ quote .
what he 's saying is n't , obviously , that we should n't care about the long run .
what he 's saying is that economists are taking the easy way out only ever considering the long run .
we need not only theories of the long run , but also theories of the short run .
nobody can " fix the unemployment problem " ....
this is the fatal conceit of socialistic central planners coming out of the chute .
" global warming is real - it is man @-@ made and it is an important problem . but it is not the end of the world." - who said it ?
__name2__ - __name1__ , the free encyclopedia
i think this issue is only valuable for the purposes of supporting commoditization of __name1__ . that 's my explanation for why all of the funded scientists point to the gas and build the anthro argument . i dont see how it is credible in light of more dominant causes .
i 'm curious dante...dosen't the temp change by about __quant1__ degrees , every year , in the northern and southern hemisphere ? also , with warmer temps and more __name1__ in the atmosphere , would n't the number and variety of plants and trees increase ? what ever happened to the rain forest , nuclear meltdown , ozone layer , global cooling , or any of the other iminent catastrophes that will befall us if we do n't do something right now ! !? the only environmental issue important to envronmentalists is whatever one can generate the most money . at least oil companies get their cash by providing us with something we need . you enviro @-@ whackos get yours by doing absolutely nothing at all , except making life harder for everyone else .
in reality humans contribute about __value1__ % to global worming in terms of __name1__ release into the atmosphere . yes it is true that we are responsible for this number and trying to minimize it in whatever way we can , but humans are not ultimately the source of global worming . it is arrogant of us to think that we can effect the ecosystem of the world in such a drastic way in only __quant1__ years . science is divided on the issues with scientists in government labs reporting that global warming is an imminent threat caused by humans and only we can save the planet while scientists at universities and private organizations generally suggest that man is not the ultimate cause and in reality contributes little . the __name2__ has published documentation and recommendations about global warming at regular intervals and it was not until one of their more recent publications that they completely overturned their previous data showing global warming to be natural in favor of new data that showed global warming to be human caused . the problem is that they used the same relative data set and simply changed the way it is viewed to maximize the human contribution . they have also been known to falsify information to suit their purposes and destroy information that proves them incorrect .
so it would appear that politics drives natural history and our relation to the ecosystem ... inherent problems there .
consider too rapid climate change events as documented by paleoclimatological data from ice cores drilled out of __name1__ and atmospheric analysis of gas frozen in the ice . this heating process occurs every __quant1__ years like clockwork for the past __quant2__ years that our records go back . guess what ... it has been just about __quant3__ years ... fancy that .
remember in the __decade1__ s when the next ice age was around the corner and we were all going to freeze to death ?
very simple . adapting to a rapidly changing climate is preferable to changing our present habits , no matter how destructive they are to the coming generations , or to the rest of the biosphere .
for most people , the present rapid changes are already stretching their abilities to adapt . they see jobs that they considered safe niches now gone forever , with no demand for skills that took __quant1__ to develop , and now the scientists are telling them that they have to change even more . that we should cease to use fossil fuels asap , that we need to switch to an energy base that features nuclear , wind , solar , geothermal , and other non @-@ polluting sources , that they do not understand , and have no experiance with .
i see otherwise intelligent people convincing themselves of the scientific equivelant of the sun rising in the west simply because they wish to avoid any more changes in the lives , and the way that they live . which , of course , pushes the changes onto their children , and grandchildren , who will be facing a much more serious situation concerning the effects of a changing climate , a rapidly changing climate , than we face today .
well , that is the culture of this nation , and our children will suffer the consequences of our inability to face reality .
how long would we live if we could replace body parts with exact matches ?
how about replacing our whole bodies and exchanging brains with that of a clone ?
someday the micro surgery techiques will be available .
would you participate ?
i would if it was sure fire .
they are patenting human genes right now .
perhaps one has an inalienable right to patent ones own body and its specific type .
do we own our own uniqueness ?
your thoughts ?
interesting book ... __name1__ ... talk about how this generation has accepted the merging of man/machine/animals....that there are about 2000 patented life forms ...
i am not real sure what that means but i am sure xox can explain it ...
i find the idea of " cloning " sillie ...
the so called " clone " is a human from your cells ... not a spare parts factory for you .
are there not still questions concerning the aging of cells in the " clone " animal or person ...
that dollie 's lambs ( remember the sheep that was cloned ) age faster due to her age at the beginning ....
so you would have to clone your infant ...
now tell me .... you have spare infant identical to the one you gave birth too and your not gonna love it ....
now that would be a brave new world .
would i be able to order clones of __name1__ and __name2__ that i could keep as sex slaves ?
if so , count me in .
go ahead and slap a property tax on them too , i 'm good for it .
__quant1__ __name1__ troops were killed when the __name2__ carrying them crashed .
may they rest in peace and condolences to the families and loved ones of these brave young men .
__quant1__ coalition troops killed this year ? man , that 's a lot .
i did n't realize the casualties were that high this year .
our __name1__ does n't seem very interested in covering the __name2__ war much . i 'm really not sure why .
that 's bad but this is the unnecessary war __name1__ started .
this is war and people die in wars .
over one million __name1__ deaths caused by __name2__ occupation
this happened in __year1__ .
they are the __value1__ and only __value1__ , i believe .
they did the same training , made it through .
that is pretty cool .
it 's like the " softest " branch of the military and the toughest assignment together .
so these guys can be sitting in a bar next to some __name1__ .
__name1__ say , " so what are you ? "
and they say , " we 're in the __name1__ ."
and maybe they snicker a little , but they should n't !
what makes people assume the __name1__ is the softest branch ?
ignorance ?
maybe you never served in any military branch and have no frame of reference ?
not to diminish the great navy fleet sailors who keep the gigantic ships running with all kinds of technical skills , __name1__ people are the real sailors who navigate tiny boats in high seas to rescue people , arrest criminals and keep __name2__ 's shores safe .
it 's not surprising that they could complete __name1__ training if they wanted to .
i 've been reading through several news sites tonight and i just picked up on a great story about a __name1__ pilot who probably saved a lot of __name2__ lives in the early goings of the __name3__ war .
now let 's get one thing straight , i initially agreed with the reason for going into __name1__ , but i no longer agree with it .
i support __name1__ 's decision to pull our troops out by next year .
i always , __value1__ % side with our brave men and women who are putting themselves in harm 's way .
now today , i came upon this story on tv .
lieutenant colonel victor fehrenbach .
he was promoted to lt. colenel in __year1__ .
he 's part of the 325 th __name1__ that serves off of __name2__ flying __name3__ @-@ 15c 's and __name3__ @-@ __name3__ .
he 's been in the __name1__ for __quant1__ years .
he is just __quant1__ years short of retirement .
he 's flown missions in __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ and has been awaiting re @-@ deployment a new tour of duty .
if you know anything about __name1__ , he 's afelm jt fly trng .
back in __year1__ this hero won the air medal for heroism .
back in __month1__ , __year1__ the __name2__ was making the initial advance to capture __name3__ int'l __name3__ , victor and his wingmen found an __name1__ ambush site of about 12 apcs that were less than __quant1__ mile from the army advance .
at the time , his wingman was suffering from a major malfunction in his plane that prohibited him from deploying his weapons .
within a timespan of __quant2__ @-@ __quant3__ minutes , he and his wingman were finally able to deploy all of their weapons and destroy the __quant1__ apcs that were about to ambush the __name1__ on their mission to take __name2__ .
they took out the entire enemy position and that night the __name1__ captured __name2__ .
why am i posting this when there have been several hundred if not thousand of other __name1__ soldiers , seamen and pilots who have each served their country heroicly and have also won medals , which some have even died for ?
because this hero was __quant1__ years away from retirement and is being discharged , against his will , from the __name1__ . is this because of bad behavior ? no. he has an excellent record of service and has never had any problems . then why , if this __quant2__ @-@ year veteran who is an excellent pilot of the __name2__ being discharged against his will , __quant3__ years before he retires ?
because he 's openly gay . he 's commanded squadrons , saved other __name1__ soldiers ' lives and served with honor .
but because he is different than we are , because he is sexually attracted to men , his sexuality trumps the incredible record of service he 's had over __quant1__ years .
are you telling me that the most professionally trained , the meanest , the fiercest military in the world that can destroy any other enemy and accomplish any goal its given , cannot accept men or women who have different seuxality tastes than other people ?
this do n't __name1__ , do n't __name1__ law absolutely must be repealed immediately !
men and women who fight to save our country , who are more than willing to die to protect our freedom , must not be discriminated against .
it 's time to end prejudice and time to accept human beings for who they are - espeically our heroic men and women in the __name1__ . support our troops !
all of them !
in these troubled times we simply cannot do without this significant portion of potential enlistees , and talented senior members , to uphold an absurd , and bigoted , policy .
most absurdly , we are allowing ourselves to fire __name1__ language specialists , people whose positions are critical at this time , due to a trait that has no effect on the performance of their duties .
i know __name1__ has a lot on their plates right now , but they need to move on this soon .
preferably with a solution that would allow soldiers lost to this idiotic policy to reenlist if they still wish to .
its not that the military is against gays .
the military is against things that make it run less efficiently .
allowing blacks to enter the military increased its numbers and productivity thus the long term goals outweighed the short term unease .
allowing openly gay men @/@ women into the service would create long term discomfort and you would see a decrease in troop numbers as well as military efficiency .
because of the nature of the military and close quarters shared especially among men in war simulation , training and actual warfare the distraction of having someone who you know may be attracted to you can ultimately cause death because you are distracted .
as part of the __name1__ ?
they do pretty much the same things though the __name1__ has the much more elite units and more highly trained infantry .
the army , as demonstrated by its successful execution of __name1__ @-@ __name1__ during __name2__ , is also capable of making daring amphibious assaults , so why not just disolve the __name3__ into the army ?
you are aware that the __name2__ is the only service that is protected by __name1__ act ?
the __name1__ must maintain a minimum of 3 divisions and can not be disbanded without a __name2__ act .
this was done in the early __year1__ 's because of rejects like you .
because the __name1__ needs bodyguards for the officer corps and a expeditionary force , too .
leave the fucking __name1__ alone .
they 're one of the few organizations i still have some respect for in this nation .
to be honest , the __name1__ is a great service .
i have served with several stellar performers from __name1__ and 3 rdarmored .
got friends in the __name1__ and 82 nd __name2__ or airmoble .
the bottom line ( and the hook and sinker ) is that man for man , and dollar for dollar the __name1__ cannot match the " kick in the door " specialty that our __name2__ do .
btw i did a force on force with the 10 th __name1__ in the late 80 's .
they were attempting to go @-@ light and were using our fmfm 's to teach em techniques .
and besides , they aint ready to be __name1__ yet .
you just know i have to weigh in on this one !
each service and the __name1__ have their unique roles .
there are of course some similarities and overlap between them .
that is what allows the __name1__ military great flexibility in operational execution .
funding will always be an issue .
each service thinks their requirements are more important than the other service 's .
because not everything gets funded , we go to war with the military we have and not the military we want .
obviously , there has been interservice rivalry since the first ship went to sea with fighting men on board .
the __name1__ has brotherhood beef with the __name2__ but we recognize that the marines are a unique unrivaled infantry machine .
the __name1__ has the ability to meet any infantry requirement anywhere and is set up for long term missions .
the long term ability of the __name1__ mesh 's with the immediate ferocity of the __name2__ .
they are far from the same and if combined would defeat the purpose of their original designs .
a funny story ( at least to me ) .
i have __quant1__ sons in the __name1__ corp , both of whome recently completed their mos training and headed to their permanent duty stations .
__quant1__ of them went through mos school at __name1__ , mo .
he was telling me that the __name1__ trainee 's had top salute the __name2__ ( no matter their rank ) ....
that to me shows the respect that the __name1__ has for the elite __name2__ fighting force ... and a respect that would be lost if they were part of the army .
he also told me that the __name1__ guys got additional pay for being stationed on the same base as __name2__ and that the __name2__ were not allowed to go round in groups of more than 4 , because they were concerned about what they could do to anyone .
be afraid ... be very afraid .... __name1__ all the way ! !!!
man , how the hell can people do this ? ?
and a mother especially ..... where is the motherly love and the mother instinct to protect her children ? ?
blind rage is just that @- blind .
i once found myself holding a steak knife @- ready to plunge it into my chest .
and i did , in my mind .
i was already dead .
but by some other force , i did n't .
i still do n't know why .
it was __quant1__ of but __quant2__ miracles that i 've witnessed in my life .
folks black out so to speak .
they black out to one singular vision that is a reality of past present and future . and for that i hold them ( and once myself ) harmless .
drugs . valle had over 20 different kinds of drugs she was taking .
it 's a wonder she could find the bathtub .
neither one will go down in the history books as the best in theirsports ............................
both were considered shoe @-@ ins duringtheirprime
i want to say something else too though .
i watched a documentary about __name1__ once , it was one that focused more on his fighting career than his personal life .
my god , as a boxer that young man was simply awesome - and that is not a word that i use very often .
if i remember correctly he won __quant1__ out of his __value1__ __quant2__ professional fights by __value1__ round knock out , generally consummated by a left @-@ upper @-@ cut struck on the jaw that would lift a __quant3__ @-@ pound man __quant4__ feet off the mat .
its impossible to compare athletes from different eras .
in golf alone the equipment is so much better now than it was even __quant1__ years ago let alone __quant2__ or __quant3__ years ago .
its also impossible to compare the competition levels .
i do n't think __name1__ was ever slated to be the greatest boxer of all time .
regardless of his skills , he never had the competition during his era to be considered the greatest
__name1__ defeated __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ and __name5__ who were all better than anyone __name6__ ever faced
i found out today that the __name1__ that i go to is closing down .
this is the __value1__ store in my area to close in the last year , and i 'm actually a bit upset about it , because the few that remain are n't close enough to drive to .
__name1__ already drove the mom and pop videostores out of business , and they are being driven out by movies on line , movies on demand , and movies by mail @- businesses they are trying to get into .
i guess some would call this progress , but i think we are losing something as well .
redbox is a simpler version of __name1__ , in that you can still go to a __name2__ and browse and get a movie right then and there .
i actually prefer the __name1__ because it does n't have nearly as much selection .
enough but not so much that __quant1__ stand there for __quant1__ hour , you know ?
all of the __name1__ around us closed down .
you can get some great deals on movies @/@ tv shows as they unload their inventory .
they drop the prices each week so if you 're looking for something in @-@ particular , nows a good time to keep an eye out for it .
also , when ours closed down they offered a free movie ( that you were buying anyways , __quant1__ think whatever the cheapest movie you were purchasing ) and __quant1__ month free of blockbuster online ( it 's like __name1__ ) .
you can just cancel before the __quant1__ month timeframe is over .
i took them up on the offer ... good deal .
for me , part of the fun of renting movies was going to the store with your chick and picking them out , bullshitting with other people in the store , etc.
god forbid we have to leave the house for __quant1__ hour and move our limbs .
what guy hears about a little boy being raped and dosen't call the cops .
the guy that notified his superiors , who should have called the cops .
fire them all
i assume he assumed after reporting it up the chain that something would be done .
i do though think the school made the right move last night , just wish __name1__ had been able to go out on a more positive note after what he 's done for nearly __quant1__ years at __name2__ .
wish him a long and happy retirement .
how interesting is this .
some guy is going to tweet __name1__ in " real time " as it happened way back when .
i imagine you could tweet vintage ww2 headlines __quant1__ but not much else .
the minutiea of such an undertaking are indeciperable .
this quest is noble .
__name1__ has beaten her predecessor __name2__ in a ballot for the federal __name3__ leadership by a margin of 73 votes to 29 .
follow events as they happen on our live blog .
2 . __name1__ has said he would retire if he lost .
now is not the time to be bickering with an election coming .
4 . i 've been in __name1__ the past __quant1__ weeks ...
... where the __name1__ political story has been top news .
the local papers are of the opinion that , whomever won the leadership contest , the __name1__ party was likely to be heavily damaged going into next year 's elections .
local __name1__ activists were part of this protest .
file this under " holy s***!"
hundreds of protesters from various groups converged on the state capitol in __name2__ , __name1__ today .
shortly before the protesters arrived , capitol police discovered a truck laden with explosives parked outside the capitol .
yeah , this sounds like bullshit .
one , the protesters were not targeted .
that 's an invention of the blog reprinting this .
second , i have a really hard time believing that there were any actual " explosives , " since the news story they link to talks about __quant1__ guy getting arrested for threatening governor __name1__ .
nothing about explosives charges , etcetera , which they 'd be quick on top of if there were any actual explosives .
given the way these stories get exaggerated , " several improvised explosive devices " could mean anything down to a few bundles of firecrackers -- or nothing at all , since false reports are n't at all uncommon .
doubly so since they apparently did not even bother to tow the truck , so clearly there was n't a serious threat .
translation out of hype @-@ speak : some kook made threatening noises at __name1__ and got arrested . the end .
of what am i trying to convince you ?
i 'm expressing my own views here .
what you believe is of concern only in terms of debate .
and possibly adding to my knowledge if i 'm convinced there 's justification .
so far , not .
if that article represents the final word on " substance " to you , that 's fine with me .
i am , and remain skeptical .
i 'm sure they found something .
hard to make any case at all without something tangible .
what it is , who put it there , and why remain , for me , unknown , and also remain deciding factors for me .
wingnut @/@ hard for me to grasp . goodness , disagreeing with you causes personal attacks . not hard to believe when considering the weakness of your argument .
this is excellent news , we needed a counter balance !
it was revealed in __month1__ that __name1__ @/@ __name2__ were creating the right wing __name4__ version of __name3__ .
1 . what makes u think these channels will be a counter balance to anything lol nt
2 . because when all else fails , i still trust in __name1__ !
3 . __name2__ 's __name1__ network has been rated the __value1__ most conservative news coverage .
still , a conservatively biased channel is preferable to a conservative propaganda channel , which is what the __name1__ __name2__ channel will certainly be .
4 . how is univisions coverage ?
i understood that it was a center left network .
i turned on my coputer this morning and instead of opening the internet to my __name2__ home page ( white ) it opened to a page called " __name1__ " which was black .
i thought , hmm , they do funny things with the __name1__ letters for holidays , so maybe today is __name2__ wednesday or something .
i " blackled " it and found out they changed the page to black to save energy .
does this make sense ?
any teeth to this and if so , does it make enough of a differrence for web developers to switch ?
i just googled __name1__ and when i click on the __value1__ selection it takes me to the white __name1__ page , so apparently we still have a choice .
the new search from __name1__ has the __name2__ address , not google .
also , when we have a choice for skins , like i think we do ( or did at one time ) here on __name1__ , then we could all contribute to the energy savings by using the black skin , right ?
so , we could participate that way , too .
( although i find the black page harder to read .)
anyone familiar with the workings of energy that could explain the black page using less ?
or , whether or not it is that significant ?
only so long as they have no redeeming qualities , i imagine .
it is always wrong to kill anybody , whatever they have done .
i heard it costs upwards of __quant3__ __quant2__ dollars to execute __quant1__ prisoner ; that sure buys a whole lot of years in prison .
a concurrent thread has touched on the the role of religion in the __name1__ civil rights movement , and its place in the us constitution .
is the " equality " issue " religious wish fulfilment " which flies in the face of biological and sociological " fact " ?
i think you are answering if __quant1__ men are the " same " and not necessarily if they are equal in rights or should be .
t k o
i see equality as a goal to strive for , although in effect , it is somewhat arbitrary , dependant on the whims of changing times .
while riding the bus earlier this week , i overheard a man say that if he " had the guts to do it , " he would jump off an overpass .
he followed up with an affirmation that he would never do it because he would never find those guts .
we are probably all familiar with the traditional saying regarding suicide - that it is a " coward 's way out ."
my question is this : is it really ? or is it the opposite ?
that is , does the act of suicide actually require courage to commit ?
personally i believe it requires a tremendous amount of courage and perhaps the greatest amount of courage of any possible action .
after all , we are speaking of terminating one 's own life , perhaps forever ending one 's existence .
we all have our thoughts on what comes next , but no one can be certain .
one may be forever ending his existence , or he may be forever subjecting himself to punishment if the religious views on suicide being a sin are correct .
either way though , one is entering the unknown by willingly terminating his life , which blatantly violates the biological drive to live , to continue existing .
how can this not be an extremely courageous act , much more so that " finding the courage to remain alive in the face of unbeatable problems ? "
remaining alive to face one 's problems is continuing the state of existence that one has always known .
ending that life is journeying into something new , something that may be better or may be worse than the current state of existence the individual is comfortably familiar with .
either way he is terminating his life and accepting the state of death that deep down we all fear .
how can one consider voluntarily entering that state cowardly ?
@elmud , well , i think your reasoning has merit :
[ indent]one is fearful of some thing one overcomes their fear to do that thing in so doing , one can therefore said to have courage [/indent ]
so yes ; strictly speaking , i think you 're correct .
although i must admit , it strikes me as very unproductive to give praiseworthy words to such an act .
" he had the courage to kill himself "; though correct in this sense , leads to a ' destructive ' conclusion .
as a side note , labeling it as a " cowardly " or " easy " way out - i think - is simply people using derision to express their disapproval .
such disapproval may be certainly warranted - and i disapprove of it generally - but what one must go through ( mentally , emotionally and @/@ or experiencially ) can hardly be called " easy ".
i can also envision a state where , for me , such a solution could be warranted ; not a good __quant1__ to be sure , but conceivable nonetheless .
to fight with every last stitch of breath for even the most @-@ remote possibility for " things getting better " is what i hold to .
interesting twist on the issue . thanks for posting
@withoutreason , it is a purely courageous act , especially if you prepared for it so that it was least painful for your loved ones .
i do n't know if it could be argued as a logical choice , per se , especially if you had not yet tried letting go of all the things that bring you down ( psychologically speaking ) .
but , if you just got your arms and legs blown off by and ied , then by all means , have at it . ( err ... have someone do it for you .)
according to most analyses , from within and without the petroleum industry , the world supply of oil , relative consumption , will effectively peak in the next decade .
what does this mean ?
if demand exceeds supply , someone will neccessarily have to go without .
the issue is who ?
some nations will be priced out , most likely the relatively undeveloped countries in which automotive transportation is not really essential .
however , when there is not enough oil to satisfy even the industrialized nations , which totally depend on oil not only for transportation , but for farming , various chemicals industries , etc. , how will they likely respond ?
obviously , war is a possiblity ; they have been fought for far less in the past .
of course , access to petroleum itelf is not the only issue .
most of the world 's food is grown using modern farming methods that require enormous amounts of gas .
if the amount of surplus food suddenly decreases as a result of peak oil , the poor around the world will starve , lamentable in itself , causing instabilities that could lead to conflict over scarce resoures .
__name1__ comes to mind .
the economy of that nation is being built , with questionable logic by the central planners , on the __name1__ model : i.e. dependent on cheap petroleum .
what is unique about __name1__ is that the ruling party 's legitmacy is intimately assosciated with rapid economic progress .
if this were suddenly to halt or risk collapse , would that ruling party push the country into war , either to acquire access to oil or simply as a distraction , as so many authoritarian regimes have done in the past ?
there is shift of power occuring in __name1__ , as __name2__ and __name3__ exert their influence .
the __name1__ of which they , along with ian , __name2__ and most of the former __name3__ republics , are memebers , has stated that it intends to remove __name4__ influence from the region and failitate the rise of a ' multi @-@ polar world .'
i do n't want to guess their specific motives , but it seems to me that such an arrangement could be very advanategous for those nations in the event of a crisis brought on by peak oil .
between __name1__ and __name2__ , they would have access to enormous oil reserves , from which they could , if supplies were too short , deny the __name3__ __name4__ comes to mind as well .
as anyone who has done even the most superficial research on that nation would know , the __name1__ is a joke , a paper tiger and a tyranny hated by most of its people .
if elections were held their , or if there was a struggle for power , the regime that woudl arise would be friendly with __name1__ and extremely antagonistic to the u.s.: quite understandably i might add .
with the largest oil reserves in the world , it is vital that the __name1__ maintain contorl over __name2__ , which means propping up the __name3__ , and it would be equally benificial to __name4__ or to __name5__ and its partners in __name6__ to facilitate a revolution there , which would allow them greater access by default .
and so , after all that , which you might justly consider paranoia , my question is basically this ; in light of the threat of peak oil , and of the general decline in __name1__ economic might relative the rest of the world ( not to mention the current u.s. crisis ) , what do think the world will look like in __quant1__ decade or __quant2__ ?
if __name1__ hegemony fails , as appears inevitable , what will be its replacement ?
nice post and important issue .
i really , really hope that alternative sources are being as enthusiastically @-@ pursued as the urgency of the situation dictates they should .
but the __value1__ , perhaps facetious , response i had to " what would happen "-question was to recall the 80 's movies : __name1__ , and __name2__ : __name2__
i 'll admit though : there 's a part of me that wants to see all this fossil @-@ fuel b.s. come tumbling down .
even if it set transportation , technology and civilization in general back some , i 'd think a " reboot in a better direction " ( read : away from finite resources , fossil fuels ) is so much the better .
yea , more war over oil resources is likely ; perhaps even inevitable .
there is no question that the coming century will see a confluence and will be a critical turning point in human history .
peak oil will be one of the primary drivers of this process .
we may very well be called upon to choose between collective life and death .
the potential is there for both .
if we so choose to do so the technology we will have available in the near term future is perfectly capable of salvaging the situation .
but if we do n't and we allow our technological civilisation to collapse under its own weight , the next generations of humans will have to do without the major stepping stone of an oil based economy .
there simply will not be enough oil left .
they may not be able to kickstart their own industrial era .
i think what you are going to see is a shift towards localized economies .
as the oil supply becomes smaller and population grows there just will not be enough to feed the system .
hopefully , people realize that it is going to take oil to move beyond oil , so the focus should be using what is readily available wisely , before the shift becomes extremely expensive .
i just read of __name1__ 's death in __name2__ -- he is primarily know as a science fiction author , but his science fiction presaged many of the technologies that we now consider plebian .
his prediction of geosychronous satellites in the 40 's are now so utilitarian that this __quant1__ hour equatorial __name1__ is now known as the clark __name1__ ,
many other of his ' fictions ' have now become casual technology .
i remember when he did that show " __name1__ " about enigmas and theories about things like __name2__ , great pyramids , and __name3__ .
great man , great body of work , a truly enlightened soul who will revisit us again i 'm sure .
see you in the blink of an eye , buddy .
this was sad news .
i enjoyed his books and his perspective on things .
another giant gone .
shame nobody ( except a quoted person ) spelled his name right .
i could n't for the life of me figure out where to post this question , so i thought i 'd put it here since it 's biologically relevant ... somewhat .
do n't ask me why but i need to know what happens if you dye your eyebrows .
say you want to disguise yourself by bleaching dark hair blonde and that you wanted to do the eyebrows as well to complete the disguise .
now the hair on your head will eventually grow and you 'll lose the blonde @-@ ness , but what about the eyebrows ?
i do n't remember ever having them cut or trimmed , so would they stay blonde ?
eyebrows have a different " terminal length " than head @-@ hair -- that is , they grow to a certain length ( and not longer ) , then fall out .
they 're still going through the growth process , though .
the old ones fall out , the new ones fall in .
so it 'd have to be re @-@ done at intervals , yep .
this excessive concern with little eyebrows is a trifle odd .
i do n't think soz is looking to disguise herself .
i think she 's on the vamp .
according to __name1__ it is the males who do the vamping .
what 's the scientific explanation of the reversal in humans ?
its the same with long @-@ haired dogs and short @-@ haired dogs .
the short haired dog has hair strands that ( on the average ) fall out or break before the average long @-@ haired dog 's .
eyebrow hairs grow much slower than head hair , so if you dye everything together , your head hair will show " roots " long before the eyebrows do .
i dye my eyebrows all the time , whether i 'm doing a touch up to the roots , or my entire head .
so , that 's every __quant1__ weeks .
i do n't know how fast my eyebrows grow , but after __quant1__ weeks there 's always a grey one in there somewhere .
i guess they grow as fast as women seem to need to pluck them .
btw , when you 're dying them , use a __name1__ @-@ __name1__ , and make sure you get it all the way to the root .
i rather suspect that the " there is a god who always was -- and the god created what we see and can infer exists " scenario has more appeal forl you .
am i correct ?
a " theory " is nothing more than an explanation of known facts ... when and if the facts change , the theory would be expected to change . therefore , any proposed " theory " that is not supported by known facts is to be rejected . however , support for any one theory does not
automatically lead to a rejection of a __value1__ or even a __value2__ if those
theories are also supported by the facts .
facts , not interpetations , are the basis for evaluation . an open and
curious mind and a regard for truth are still the basis for good science .
media coverage and political support are not .
it 's a common argument that the universe is tuned " just so " for life to exist , and that any slight modification means that " life " would be impossible .
but this premise assumes that life as we know it is the only form of life that *can* exist . and i disagree with this assumption .
the life we see around us evolved in this universe as conditions allowed , so it 's not surprising at all that everything fits nicely . other universes with different rules would necessarily have life in them which fits that universe . and universes which are sterile have no life in them to question the fact that they are not there .
the really interesting thing to realize is that life evolves in universes ( at least this __quant1__ ) at all . is the evolution of life in a universe pure chance , or is it inevitable ?
in our universe at least , life not only can exist , but does exist . and that means that our universe is itself , alive , in a very real sense . and we are its thoughts .
a variant on the multi universe which seems to me obvious , and very real , is the infinite universe .
here the universe that we perceive is simply __quant1__ cell of infinity , the others being like or unlike " cells " beyond our own , but filling the remainder of " everything " beyond our specific " this " with " otherthings ", identical , or not .
if we look at the magnitudinal stratification of this universe we go from , as we interpret it , and with our current ability to decern at sub nano levels , the smallest subatomic particles through atoms , molecules , solids , constructs , and on , and on , and on , to planets , star systems , galaxies , and on to our entire known universe .
would it not be foolish to assume this " __name1__ " like lattice would stop at the extreem of our meagre ability to observe , rather than continue to follow its serial makeup to unimagined levels of structure , and beyond to infinity ( infinity , of course not being a point , but rather a lack of constraint quantifier ) .
multiverse
i was working on a research project on the concept of the multiverse and while i enjoyed the incoherent rambling argument on whether there is a god or not im feeling kind of empty . the universe is the way it is because if it werent then we wouldnt be able to contemplate on whether therte is a god or not . and trying to justify the existence of god through anything dealing with relativity is laughable . god is only able to exist through faith . and faith goes against everything that science stands for .
a key issue in disscussion of " life " and " universes " is what constitutes " structure " or " order ". for example , to take bgw 's ( and __name1__ 's ) fractal model of embedded " structures " we are still left with the regression problem of " who observes @/@ defines such structure ".
my own conclusion is that terms like " multiverse " have no separate reality with respect to a singular concept whilst the criteria for " reality " concern explanation of what we call " events " in the single universe . i am saying that the occurence of " life " is not an " event " in the usual sense because events presuppose " observers " who classify them as such . ( observation in " our minds eye " is cognitive sleight of hand ) note also the term " multi " implies " one who classifies or counts " and we can ask again who is this other than ourselves ?
in short , the corollary the universe appears like it is because we are like we are is equally valid .
the transcendent question is of course " what constitutes explanation " and how can this encompass the interaction of observer and observed ?
rather than take a reductionist view proposing infinite , slightly different universes that somehow interact ( alah m @-@ theory ) , allow for strong emergence via the landauer @-@ lloyd analysis of flaws in the of the __name1__ argument that supports reductionists . basically this states the final outcome of a system may not be soley defined by outcomes written into the basic laws of physics * a gazzillion atoms , but there can be " a cosmic imperative " written into the laws of nature ( __name2__ - __name3__ uni - __name4__ , __name5__ - emergent biological principles and the computational resources of the universe , __name6__ vol 10( 2 ) , p1 "
so basically ultra complex systems can produce wierd outcomes ; such as rocks , intelligent life or high temperature superconductors all from the same raw materials - simply arranged slightly differentally . this might bring down the number of universes required to create life from infinite to merely fairly large !
can we please get these people a voice in __name1__ ?
how long are we supposed to wait to see if this womans brain will ever rewire effectively before we move on ?
we __name1__ have let our victim fetish get so bad that we are pathetic .
if i were in __name1__ @-@ __name1__ , i think this would be a fair question but i 'm not sure of what the mechanism to remove a congresswoman is other than the ballot box .
__name1__ was not all there but still held his office with the consent of his constituents .
i think as long as her constituents are ok with it , we do n't get a say .
as butrflynet pointed out , __name1__ 's office is doing quite a lot .
that does n't seem incidental or trivial to me .
__name1__ was voted in because people agreed with her policies and approach to politics .
she hand @-@ selected this group of people who now make up her office , with the intent of working together to implement her vision .
in that way , she is still the representative , as these people take her stated vision and priorities and work to make them happen .
if __name1__ is unable to recover fully before the next election , i think it would make sense that her __value1__ @-@ in @-@ command , or whomever has been most instrumental in the work that her office has been doing since the injury , goes ahead and runs in her place .
i think engineer 's point about not encouraging removal from office by gunshot is a good one .
the members of the minority party in the __name1__ are largely ciphers anyway , although only a few of them have the excuse that they suffer from medically certifiable brain damage .
all the __name1__ in the __name2__ could take __quant1__ year @-@ long vacation and the results would largely be the same , so giffords 's absence from her duties is hardly consequential .
indeed , the country would benefit if more congressmen could be induced to take extended breaks from their duties .
it might be a good idea to keep track of this woman . some basics from her __name1__ biography might be helpful .
the congresswoman , who is about to turn __quant1__ , was born in __name1__ . when her parents divorced , she moved to __name2__ with her mother . she worked in a kibbutz after high school , attended __name3__ , the now defunct law school at __name4__ and the __name5__ law school where she took a master 's degree in tax law .
she has been married for __quant1__ years . " __name1__ and her husband own a __name2__ counseling clinic in __name3__ , __name4__ .
__name1__ also has an ownership stake in __name2__ , __name3__ farm land . since the death of her father @-@ in @-@ law , the farm and its buildings have been rented out to a neighboring farmer who maintains a dairy herd on the farm . from __year1__ through __year2__ , the tenant @-@ farmer received $ __quant1__ in __name4__ subsidies , chiefly for dairy and corn price supports ."
initially a __name2__ , she became disillusioned with __name1__ . in __year1__ , the __name4__ documentary by __name5__ , " __name3__ live ? " impelled her to take up an anti @-@ abortion stance and she and her fiance began praying outside abortion facilities .
" in __year1__ , __name1__ and other parents started a k @-@ __value1__ charter school in __name2__ , and she began speaking against a state @-@ mandated set of educational standards , which propelled her into the world of politics .
__name1__ became an outspoken critic and opponent of __name3__ 's __name2__ @-@ __name2__ @-@ __name2__ policies . in a __year1__ column , she wrote : " school @-@ to @-@ work alters the basic mission and purpose of k @-@ __value1__ academic education away from traditional broad @-@ based academic studies geared toward maximizing intellectual achievement of the individual . instead , school @-@ to @-@ work utilizes the school day to promote children 's acquisition of workplace skills , viewing children as trainees for increased economic productivity."*
* my reaction : what a surprise .
i love __name1__ !
with any luck , she will be the __name1__ nominee for the __year1__ presidential race .
a dream opponent for the dems , really .
now , if her running mate were to be someone named turner , the dems could be in trouble , like , a __name1__ @-@ turner ticket would blow them off the road once the campaign got into overdrive .
doubt if she 'd adopt an anti @-@ vocational ed stance , though .
all i know , is the more i see her on television , the better .
__name1__ : __value1__
@33export ,
i 'm not certain that everyone will " get " the reference to __name3__ @-@ __name3__ . the __name2__ , however , will .
@plainoldme ,
it made me laugh ( and i am american ) .
thats only because you aint seen nothing yet .
@maxdancona ,
my comment was simply a reply to the backhanded reference to __name1__ .
imho , __name1__ is not as sharp as a bowling ball and has no business even thinking about running for president .
i love watching __name1__ . she is funnier than any sitcom on television . bad thing is she makes __name2__ ronmey look very solid . i mean , compared to __name4__ and bachmann , romney sounds like __name3__ lol .
@jcboy ,
i believe that __name1__ has a real chance of beating __name2__ for the nomination . i think it will come down to the __quant1__ of them , and romney 's negatives , from being a __name3__ to having taken so many positions in the past that annoy __name4__ .
a " selection of recent articles on the __name1__ presidential wannabe and __name2__ darling ", from the __name3__ here
@walter hinteler ,
as amusing as a __name1__ candidacy would be , itll never happen . there are some intelligent people in the rnc who realize that this would be tantamount to handing over the presidential race to __name2__ without firing a shot . the rnc is scared that the public may love her like they do sarah.with the __name3__ trying to find its " center of mass " they are p[arading out these clowns that can only cause them big trouble in __month1__ __year1__
it 's that time again .
politicians running for mid @-@ term elections are attacking their opponents and in doing so , stretching truths where ever they may be found .
i want to get a list of fact check websites going .
it 'd be interesting to see if different sites come up with the same facts ....
i figure someone should just start a website called they all lie dot com and just post pics of all the candidates , that would certainly make it easier
i 'm kind of cynical that fact even matter anymore .
we 've left the information age , we are well into the opinion age .
that idiotic __name3__ " __name2__ " was ripped to shreds by __name1__ , but it won't matter because those who believe it ( or at least believe in the idea of it ) won't ever dare venture near a fact checking source .
i think we need a new web service that fact checks , but also tracks who comes and reads the facts .
you must have been reading the __name1__ , in which the __name2__ promises to return the country to failed __name3__ policies of borrow and spend and the elimination of oversight and regulation .
it was his policies that brought us a net job loss over __quant1__ years ( __value1__ in history ) , banks that became , in essence , hedge funds , sleazy sub @-@ prime mortgage loans , torture , corruption , etc.
moreover , privatizing __name1__ and __name2__ is a prescription for disaster .
( check with the brits who went through this relative to their version of __name1__ .)
while the hostilities between internal factions of the clerical regime and their feuding over the sham election is escalating , the people of __name1__ , particularly young people , demonstrated in their thousands in different parts of the city including fatemi street , __name2__ @-@ __name2__ and square , vanak square , shariati street , takht @-@ e @-@ tavoos __name2__ and __name3__ against the illegitimate and fraudulent election .
whereas i take every single word uttered by __name1__ with a grain of salt the size of __name2__ , even i can smell the stink from that election .
dear fellow __name1__ , this __day1__ th of __month1__ , while you and your family celebrate the __value1__ th anniversary of the founding of our great nation , there 's __quant1__ party you won't be invited to ...
... and that 's the party that __name1__ is throwing at __name2__ headquarters in __name3__ -- using your tax dollars -- for nearly fifty dictatorships , __quant1__ terrorist states , governments that endorse execution based on religious faith , and a multitude of other nations from around the globe .
you see , this party is n't to honor your freedoms -- but to conspire to take them away .
over our __month1__ __day1__ th holiday , on __name2__ soil , they are preparing to enact a legally @-@ binding treaty that would give the u.n. unchallengeable power to ban civilian ownership of all firearms .
that means your rifles , your shotguns and your handguns . and your freedom !
to learn what you can do to stop the u.n .' s global gun ban treaty @-@ before it destroys our __name1__ right to keep and bear arms visit __value1__ .
just as a handful of patriots fired the " shot heard ' round the world " at __name2__ , it 's up to you and me and every patriot who cherishes our __name1__ to tell the world today that our nation will not be bullied by the u.n.
thank you for acting today .
throw ' em out , and drop out .
this organization has been financed with __name1__ tax dollars since its inception , and all it does it feed off of the money and try to kill the host . f--- ' em .
odd , such an extensive website about the threat of this global gun ban treaty , a dozen webpages at least -- and it doesnt actually seem to have a single link to the actual text of said proposed ban .
do n't those __name1__ members want to check out for themselves what the text actually says ?
do n't you think it 's odd ?
do n't you want to know what that ban treaty actually says ?
the treaty can be found here..
it seems that __name1__ is in support of criminals based on the what this treaty does .
try reading the __name1__ treaty when you sober up cj..
you might find it is n't even close to what you desperately want to think it is .
what makes you think the __name1__ lets little facts like that get in the way of stirring up fear ?
like the __name1__ is going to actually demand that we close our firearm factories , and they are just going to lock the doors because of this treaty .
lethal injection electric chair gas chamber hanging firing sqaud
who cares , would you rather have your hard earned tax dollars spent by keeping them behind bars .
i would n't .
lethal injection followed by hanging .
firing squad is probably pretty quick , but i do n't know that it 's used much .
the electric chair and gas chamber are nothing short of barbaric .
on the ballet i filled out yesterday , there was a __name1__ party running for president .
i tried to look up their website , but it was blocked at work .
so this even peaked my curiousity even more ( as the other candidates websites are not blocked ) .
anyone have a clue ?
here is their mission statement .
interesting - i have n't heard of them before and was curious .
what could have been so offensive that the website was blocked ?
__name1__ 's view that affirmative action should , after these many years , continue may lead to his defeat in __month1__ .
and this may be the correct result .
affirmative action equates to discrimination against nonbeneficiaries , usually while males . __name1__ says he is against quotas , but so @-@ called goals are invariable set up .
moreover , the goals are a euphemism for quotas .
__name1__ should assidiously avoid the __name2__ term and instead embrace programs the benefit the economically disadvantaged , regardless of race , gender , or ethnic origin .
depends on how it 's framed .
by far , the largest group benefiting from affirmative action is .... wait for it ..... white women .
affirmative action has been essential in allowing women to break into some high paying , male dominated fields .
many of these fields are clearly still male dominated in the management areas .
all __name1__ has to do it make the point , repeatedly , that __name2__ 's position is anti @-@ women and he is for increasing the roles women play in the workplace and he 's got a winner .
what is telling is that even when talking about __name1__ 's " defeat " the other guy never gets mentioned .
if this prediction were true i would think one would consider it what 's his name 's " victory " rather than __name1__ 's defeat .
they can n't both lose ...
the funny thing is that more __name1__ support affirmative action than oppose it ( this __name2__ shows __value1__ @-@ __value2__ in favor of aa for racial minorities ) .
the conservatives do n't understand that turning the majority of __name1__ into " liberals " is not a good electoral strategy ( as they saw in the __year1__ elections and will see again in __month1__ ) .
i 'm always surprised to see affirmative action discussed in terms of liberal/conservative .
my brother , who is a general in the __name1__ army , self identifies as conservative but is a big believer in affirmative action .
i self identify as a moderate liberal and definately identify as a woman am not nearly the supporter he is .
so i 'm just going to read along to see if the why of this being a liberal v . conservative issue becomes any clearer ......
quotas are racist .
there is no getting around it .
they are a means of making a choice based on race .
why does it surprise anyone that __name1__ would support quotas ?
__name1__ is n't against all racism , just some of it .
are those who question __month1__ @/@ __day1__ anti @-@ semites ?
anti @-@ semitism is one of the most frequent allegations levied by defenders of the government 's version of __month1__ @/@ __day1__ against people questioning that account .
is it true ?
are __name1__ @/@ __name1__ activists really anti @-@ semites ?
not anti @-@ semites .
just anti @-@ logical
so out of the __quant1__ __name2__ voters who say we need new 911 investigations there are no __name1__ ?
not likely .
this post is based on the incorrect statement that :
" anti @-@ semitism is one of the most frequent allegations levied by defenders of the government 's version of __month1__ @/@ __day1__ against people questioning that account ."
no. anti @-@ semitism is not the most frequent accusation against those that question the governments explanation of __month1__ @/@ __day1__ .
only when obvious anti @-@ semites try to say " the jews did it , " might that allegation made .
and , that i thought was a version of __month1__ @/@ __day1__ that is accepted in many muslim countries as the most popular notion .
unfortunately , anti @-@ zionism and anti @-@ semitism have been melded in the popular culture by many people .
so , anti @-@ zionists often become anti @-@ semites , rather than do the intellectual efforts to parse the __quant1__ concepts .
i saw __name1__ on a show this weekend .
when asked why no economists support her tax holiday plan , she said they were elitists who do n't understand the pain the common man is in .
just to review , __name1__ and __name2__ have proposed eliminating the federal gas tax of $ 0.18/gallon during the summer driving season .
__name1__ says he will pay for it with spending reductions , __name2__ with taxes on oil companies .
__name1__ ( and all economists ) say this is a bad idea and results in insignificant savings .
there is no support for this in congress and the president has denounced it .
if the tax is repealed , several commentators feel the refiners will take some for themselves since they have also been hurt by rising prices .
what burns me is the " elitist " comment applied to economists .
we tell our children to work hard , get a good education and become experts in their fields , but if they disagree with a politician , they become latte drinking elitists out of touch with the hard working common man .
is n't this just what __name1__ has done to the scientific community in miniture ?
is n't advice from experts required to run a country like the us ?
i 'm sure there are some economists of priviledge out there as well as some who propose solutions based on theories without regard to the impact of their ideas , but __name1__ does n't have any economists who support her proposal , so what 's the deal ?
( i do n't know about __name1__ 's beliefs since __name2__ has been doing the heavy lifting so far .)
interesting i think , is the poll released this morning on __name1__ detailing that __value1__ % think the gas tax holiday is a good thing while __value2__ % think it 's bad .
whatever , i think it 's just plain sleazy .
engineer engineer , i repeat my response on another of your topics .
i agree with you and dyslexia .
__name1__ 's desperation " gas vacation " proposal is about the __value1__ straw with me .
she has really demeaned herself as far as i 'm concerned .
it 's not only her pandering , it 's that the proposal is so stupid .
the oil companies would end up with the money by raising their prices and the public would get nothing .
__name1__ for __name2__ majority leader is now my choice for her . __value1__
__name1__ and __name2__ are trying to win votes with nickle and dime stuff ;
our economy is straining so badly , it needs more than $ __quant1__ tax rebates or one @-@ time summer relief from taxes ;
it 's called a ) saving homes of millions of families , b ) our economy , and c ) the war in __name1__ and __name2__ .
some dunderheads will fall for these gimmicks , and vote for them in __month1__ .
i have gone thru countless elections and many things are said in the heat of the campaign .
__name1__ once elected might go not thru with it .
that is not to say she lied but that wiser heads may counsel her to pass it up .
where is __name1__ ?
why has he deserted ?
his absence has been explained many times in many different ways , but he has virtually disappeared from the scene .
this would n't be so important , but he still is the vice president , is n't he ?
things are looking very muddled right now .
__name1__ , who was enjoying a limelight , is now being asked to keep a low profile , since his abrasive personality has alienated so many .
poor __name1__ , no matter how many times they parade him , still is n't impressive .
and __name1__ is beginning to look like a desperate man in search of some dignity .
a lot of public appearance is left to __name1__ , which is his job , but he does n't exactly have such an ingratiating personality either .
which does n't leave us very much in the way of impressive @-@ looking leadership .
so where is __name1__ ?
he 's in the underground command center ....
he 'll resurface soon ...
maybe he is in a cryogenic chamber right next to __name1__ .
in other words they are keeping him on ice .
moonlighting for __name1__
weird , is n't it .
i 've been wondering where he wandered off to .
he 's been ' off the radar ' for a long time .
but he told us all at the outset that this is the way it would be .
he is spending time in the bowels of __name1__ with his real boss , plotting and planning .
yes and getting richer by the day .
maybe a low profile because his name is now showing up in arabic and __name1__ papers regarding that very same __name2__ bit ?
as __name1__ would say here we go again .
__name1__ @-@ __name1__ is closing __quant1__ stores and laying off approximately 35,000 people .
it is almost __quant1__ ritual with the announcement of massive layoffs .
president __name1__ on the other hand continues to claim the economy is strong , not as strong as it could be but strong nonetheless .
he has however presented a package which he contends will stimulate the economy and create jobs .
over half of the package $ __quant1__ will come by removing the tax on dividends .
what do you think of the package will it stimulate the economy ?
in addition if the economy remains sluggish what are __name1__ 's chances for re @-@ election ?
yeah , it 'll stimulate the top __value1__ percent of the wealthy in this country , but will do nothing for our economy .
money must be put into the hands of the middle class and the poor for our economy to be stimulated .
the best way to accomplish that is to cut everybody 's taxes by __value1__ percent effective __day1__ , __year1__ .
that 'll pump about a half trillion dollars into our economy . c.i .
well , i thought it would be nice to see that title somewhere ... since i can n't find it in reality ....
it is wild to me how such an effective , strong , woman -- the closest advisor to the most powerful person in the world -- has garnered no more support , no accolades from women and blacks -- __quant1__ groups who are always trying to find successful sisters or positive stories of black achievement .
i have noticed a distinct discrimination among women and blacks in whom they will ballyhoo , and whom they won't .
if any other woman in this country had soared to the heights __name1__ has reached , it would be mardi gras 24 @/@ 7 ...
__name1__ is unwelcomed among his own race .
the __value1__ black person to serve on the __name1__ .
even if he had a disfiguring pigment problem and a __value1__ leg , if he were the slightest bit liberal -- he 'd have statues and streets named after him already .
i heard a __name1__ mayor on __name2__ today , and was heartened .
he was explaining to the ( of course , liberal ) quizzical reporter how he could be a __name1__ .
it was as if he had to apologize to the entire black community ...
i was proud that he told the reporter he felt racially stereotyped to be expected to be a __name1__ .
he should n't be expected to be anything .
it is to the great , abiding shame of women and blacks to turn their backs on the great achievements of these people .
it is the new racism ; by blacks against blacks .
the new feminist sexism . appalling .
some liberals do n't much cotton to " uppity " blacks like __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ confronting racial discrimination and outright racism and leaving the plantation of dependency on white liberals and achieving the great things they are capable of .
gotta ' keep ' em in their place , you know .
what does women or black have to do with it .
__name1__ had a women secretary of state , and __name2__ does not represent blacks , so what is your beef ?
what amuses me about __name1__ is that she lived in the __name2__ during the __name3__ , and that experience seems to have left her untouched .
yet __name1__ mentioned that background as though she actually did anything beyond striving toward her own growth .
more power to her for her achievements .
but do n't be surprised if you 're not hearing wild applause from her community , because i 'm not sure she has one ...
assuming she establishes a credible name for herself as secretary of state , i am cautiously anticipating the __name1__ nominee in __year1__ to be __name2__ .
and yes , i think she can be elected easily assuming that the __name1__ is allowed something close to a level playing field .
i think __name1__ against __name2__ or __name3__ in the last __quant1__ elections would have won by a landslide .
__name2__ , especially __name1__ __name2__ , have largely left issues of racism and @/@ or stereotypical prejudice and bigotry well behind them .
any qualified person with charisma and a track record can compete with clout .
i keep hearing that inflation is under control .
and i suppose it is if one does not need to put food on the table , buy gasoline , heating oil , electricity and many of the necessities of life .
from your prospective do you find inflation to be a non @-@ factor ?
did n't seem to have much effect on the last couple of yachts i bought .
now , i hear that high end housing ( 1 1 @/@ 2 million +) are also holding the line in some areas .
this whole economy seems to be based on the comfort level of the ones referred to by __name1__ as his base .
lock up all scumbags .
lock 'm up .
make 'm work .
break up the gangs .
if you get caught with meth , got to jail ...
there is no unfortunate case .
you had dope its illegal , you knew it was illegal before you had the dope .
and to whomever spoke of the innocence in prison , quit talking like that is the norm .
__value1__ %of inmates deserve to be there .
i will take those odds in __name1__ any day .
please pick __name1__ to be your vicepresident .
please read this if you do n't instantly see why ... http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1632736,00.html
he would ensure that moderates , libertarians , and technocrats sick of politics as usual would vote for you .
he is easily among the most competent politicians we have .
he researches and practices evidence based politics and thus virtually every policy he sought no matter how unpopular proved a success .
and he like you knows how to balance budgets without hurting the economy .
he can also pay for the election campaign .
i highly doubt that __name1__ is going to switch parties .
he 's already an independent ( switched from __name1__ ) .
but , offset __name1__ 's " __name2__ elite " and " inexperienced " negatives with __name3__ 's " __name2__ elite " and " inexperienced " negatives ? not so much .
personally i look upon this conflict as the source of __value1__ % of __name1__ @-@ __name2__ 's confrontation ,
the __name1__ needs and so supports israel , israel wants to stop attacks on its citizens and so strike on __name2__ targets , which in turn results in more attacks on israel , this increases the number of radical __name3__ too , which results in attacks against america around the world( military targets , embassies , and citizens ) resulting in american foriegn policy like the war on __name4__ and @/@ or __name5__ , and the circle continues , reactions to actions resulting in reactions , this circle having no beginning and no end
is not easy to solve , but if we try to and start by the issue at core( __name1__ @-@ __name2__ conflict ) the rest can be handled ,
i want to start a thread here , that simulates peace negotiations between __quant1__ sides , palestinians ( me and who ever volunteers ) against __name1__ side ( i suppose volunteer wouldnot mind representing them and any one he chooses )
each side is allowed __quant2__ posting per day , then after every __quant3__ posts its discussed freely by all for __quant3__ days , then each side makes a post , as the __name1__ side is the __quant2__ with most demands lets let them start( if its ok by all ) ,
i need ur ok guys and girls .
very true , the same people who said __name1__ violated __name2__ resolutions , seem to forget , __name3__ has been in violation of un resolutions for __quant1__ .
give up hell , tell them to come get it ?
that goes for isreal too , if __name1__ or __name2__ were anything worthwhile , isreal would n't of got what they did .
to the victor goes the spoils .
glad i 've never backed the __name1__ .
__name2__ is __name1__ , civilized , the progenitors of the __quant1__ __name3__ community , and facing total annihilation every day of its life , thanks to being surrounded by psycopathic states .
therefore ....... we must back it . :headbang :
so you think if isreal stopped retaliating , the attacks would stop ?
no chance of that , they would chip at them untill they were extinct .
__name1__ goes to the young republicans convention in __name2__ , and asks why none of them - who strongly support the __name3__ and the __name4__ - have bothered to sign up and serve in the armed forces .
unsurprisingly , there were plenty of excuses banded about .
__name1__ get mad when the ' chickenhawk ' argument is brought up , and this is because it is damned effective .
they usually attempt to counter with some version of this line :
it is n't stupid , though .
there is a perceivable and significant differnce between those who discuss war , who think it is sometimes necessary , and who are willing to do what must be done for __name1__ safety ; and the war cheerleaders .
the actively aggressive advocates of warfare as a solution to life 's problems .
those are the chickenhawks : the ones who continually advocate the solving of our national foreign policy problems using armed force .
the ones who suggest that the __name1__ is so strong , we can go it alone if we have to and we should n't be held back from attacking other countries by little things like , say , international conventions .
they advocate using maximum force to win ; their problem with the war in __name1__ is that we are n't killing enough people over there , innocents included .
these people , who cheer on the deaths of others , who think that force is the best way to get what we want - but do n't sign up to serve themselves - are chickenhawks .
they are too cowardly to put their ass on the line , but continually advocate that others do so .
this topic is right on the money .
these leeches and vultures are the ones getting rich off of the nation 's blood .
they stand safely back , saying , " let 's you and them fight .
me ? i 'll cheer you on , while me and my friends get rich off your efforts ."
there was a time when i strongly supported the invasion of __name1__ , and it had nothing to do with presenting the good people of iraq with a democratic form of government .
oh , i also spent __quant1__ years in the us __name1__ , from a time when most of __name1__ had heard of __name2__ , through the period when just everybody could name each country in the region .
so , i 'm an oddball . s'okay .
yes , i would imagiane that __name1__ most likely did n't need the $ when he enlisted but it is curious why __name2__ rendered the investigation of his death as a secret of national security .
the __name1__ are going to stab us in the back . if we do n't turn away from __name2__ and __name3__ to rebuild @/@ recover our strength . where they 're financially and militarily , bleeding us to death .
fine , threaten to sell __name1__ equipped ships to __name2__ if they do so .
if __name1__ were to do that , they would be cutting their own throats .
the __value2__ thing that __name1__ wants is a weak dollar because that would completely wipe out any chance of a trade surplus from their __value1__ trading partner ... the __name2__
a weak dollar means lots and lots of closed down factories in __name1__ because the __name2__ can n't afford their widgets and doohickies .
they will threaten , they will try to influence , but they won't ' drop the bomb ' unless they have a guarantee of some other country willing to buy several __quant1__ dollars worth of junk __quant2__ year .
what do you think the consequences would be ?
do you think the __name1__ could pull it off ?
if not , why ?
his approval rating cannot sink , so , what 's the risk .
after all , he 's the decider , and __name1__ holds his trousers while he skinny dips .
does __name1__ want us to lose this war and cut and run as __name2__ and __name3__ have impose upon our president ?
does __name1__ want us to have to fight our way back in in __quant1__ month or __quant2__ year with a death toll in multiples of thousands over a radically less period of time ?
also if we pull out of __name1__ and go into __name2__ what will be the justification for joining that war , wmd ?
__name1__ and __name2__ telling the government not to fight __name3__ 's war is like congress and the senate telling the government not to fight racism and the __name4__ a few decades back .
these cowardly democrats are bargaining that __name1__ will be stupid and not realize the deeper war that will have to be re @-@ fought in only a few short years .
__name1__ and __name2__ will be the next war along with __name3__ if we do not create a successful democracy in __name4__ .
the power vacuum will in __name1__ pull __name2__ and __name3__ and possibly the whole __name4__ and maybe even __name5__ into an allied front against __name6__ .
this my friends is __name1__ .
__name1__ and __name2__ have been told this i am sure but they simply do n't care .
winning elections trumps all other concerns ...
do we really want these people setting public policy ?
why not leave and let the __name1__ fight the war ?
answer : if the most powerful army is already struggling in this war what will it be like when we pull out and come back in __quant1__ months to __quant2__ year ?
__name1__ and __name2__ stop trying to shove your partisan politics at our president over the generals " sound " military policies .
listening to your bribe bibber __name1__ instead of our generals ...
__quant1__ friggin ' years of this crap is enough ! !!
if we pull out now the disaster will be on your heads just in time for election ...
the blood of freedom is at stake and the very people who claim to value it are now our own worst enemies .
the new democratic __name1__ selling our freedom and dignity simply for power .
does __name1__ look to geniuses such as yourself for analysis ?
. now i know you are just kidding , that attitude is just whacky otherwise .
there are tons of examples in history of ill advised " proactive " wars , and most of these were eventually lost by the aggressors
also , rex , try to be civilized and dont resort to childish name calling .
its usually a sign of an inability to craft an argument solely based upon the issues at hand .
just because you feel passionately about this doesnt automatically mean that others will embrace your opinions .
oh yeh , and , if you call me a coward again , ill come up there to __name1__ , hunt you down , and buy you a drink first .
i 'm thinking farmerman means what he says .
the day it becomes truly cowardly of one to suggest an end to mindless mayhem is the day i want to float off this planet .
edgar , you know its a cynical attempt at " spin " by the rapidly sinking __name1__ .
his " handlers " are trying to cover ytracks and leave a legacy that is goona leve his presidency up there with __name1__ or __name2__ .
( oy , theres a comparison , __name1__ , i believe started the __value1__ of the ' proactive wars " against the __name2__ ) ,
people like you have done more to screw this country up than " the democrats " could ever have hoped to do .
you repeatedly voted for and supported a president and an administration who was clearly and obviously incompetent and ideologically extreme .
this was evident from campaign through the early years of governance .
you think that __name1__ means red , white , and blue and war and think nothing of shredding the constitution on the way to more blood and glory .
and you dare to presume that you are somehow the " real __name1__ " and the rest of us , those of us who actually know what the constitution says and know what this ignoramus is trying to do to it , are somehow going to destroy " your " country .
you wave your flag and trust an ignorant incompetent who can n't even run this country to somehow rebuild another , one that he did n't even begin to understand and had never been to .
you trust an idiot .
you think the answer to incompetence and mismanagement is faith .
you and your brethren , the __name1__ die @-@ hards , have sent this country in a death spiral .
and sadly , the only people we can have any hope of pulling us out are the " other party ".
a party that already was waning in respect due to corruption and its willingness to take some fundamental social justice concepts too far is now supported by a majority of the public , and the beloved party of small government and individual liberties is now a hulking rusty heap of corruption , scandal , incompetence , special interests , big government , and domestic spying .
maybe i am , and maybe i 'm saying that you 're an idiot .
hard to say exactly . :wink :
you mean scut farkas and his sidekick " toady " was grover dill , who was actually beaten up by delbert bumpus .
i need to set these things correct so that the record will be clear testimonyat rex 's sanity hearing .
i am a conservative , and you are an idiot .
you said..
most christions i know will not bow to another god , no matter who that god is .
thats why so many __name2__ were killed by the ancient __name1__ , they refused to bow down .
also , to use an old cliche..." i would rather die on my feet then live on my knees "
i was reading in the paper today about all the laws under consideration that would make it harder for __name1__ to vote when __quant1__ suddenly flashed on all the purple fingered __name2__ voters that were so celebrated in our press only a few short years ago .
i think i must be missing something because i 'm really confused by this .
why would any state do anything that would make it harder for it 's citizens to vote ?
please can someone explain this to me ?
that 's pretty easy .
conseratives figure ( and probably with justification ) that their voter base will get out and vote without regard for any minor hurdles which might be thrown in their way .
they rely on older citizens and more affluent citizens .
anything which makes voting more difficult they figure will reduce the number of voters going to the polls to vote for __name1__ .
i do n't have a problem with the __value1__ __quant1__ - provided that they make available photo ids at no cost to people with limited income and allow clear instructions and make it easy to obtain ( in other words - there are many locations to obtain and enough hours that are varied enough to get these ids ) .
i support having ids to limit voter fraud , but you cannot make it difficult and it should be economically feasible for all to get an id .
i mean if you make the extra effort to go out and vote - it should n't be much more a burden to get an id .
the __name1__ must return to their progressive program , and must spend the resources necessary to remind the people that the __name2__ , the right wing , the __name3__ are just plain wrong on the issues .
hopefully the __name1__ loss has made __name2__ go back on the progressive track .
what is interesting about the __quant1__ party system is the people never actually vote for a party .
they always vote against the other one .
the net result is the people are misrepresented __value1__ % of the time - but amazingly they are so dumb they can n't figure it out .
we asked you : to save money , should local governments use nonviolent inmates for physical labor ?
that was the question in the other day 's opinion section of my my local newspaper .
yes : __value1__ % no : __value2__ %
so my qestion is this , should gov't turn to slaves to save money ?
@david cv , depending on country it is already done .
hard labour , chaingangs , prison farms voluntary work while incarcerated gets minimal pay etc
the option as voluntary will at least not require quotas and enforcement through violent means( beatings ) or witholding of priveledges like food , bedding( yes bedding ) or outdoor sunlight and isolation.( legislativ brutality encouragement )
the question is what kind of work is beneficial in a crime and punishment related way .
some experiements are already implemented in disaster relief bushfires/floods , comunity work as replacement for incarceration.( anti social behaviour treatment )
it really depends on the moral standards of the nation in question .
forced labour in __name1__ compared to __name2__ or __name3__ is implemented differently
have'nt goverments @/@ corporations turned their populus trough a monetary reward @/@ tax system into working slaves anyway ?
what 's your thoughts on this ?
i mean , the guy is __quant1__ years old .
is it really necessary after all these years ?
he 's been here since __year1__ and never did a thing to any one .
being a __name1__ was what was expected of germans back then .
you and i , had we lived there during that time , would probably have been in the same boat .
the head of the __name1__ is named rosenbaum , what do you expect ?
while i disagree with you that we 'd all be nazis , it was over __quant1__ years ago , and the man has obviously reformed .
expelling him was a political move to strengthen the zionist stance through a reminder of the holocaust , and serve as a talking point for the anti @-@ __name1__ crowd .
so i was discussing that new tv show on __name2__ , __name1__ , with my grandfather .
he made a comment that was interesting , he said , " that show is just the liberal media trying to get us used to the idea of a woman president for when __name1__ runs ."
now , my grandfather is one of those old , cynical guys that thinks that every sports game that does n't go his way is fixed , and is a tad racest , however , i found the statement intrigueing and made me wonder .
what are your guys ' opinions ?
i 've definitely heard that argument before , and i refuse to watch the dang show .
ok so i live in __name1__ and maryjane was just legalized in our state .
well all know why a state would legalize it , but do you really think that it can help somebody ? if so why ?
think of any other drugs that you feel may help someone .
think of this . when i was doing crystal , i was in school .
__quant1__ never missed __quant1__ day of school .
when i went to my classes tweaking , i paid more attention to what was going on in class .
i went home did all of my homework .
i remember lookin at __quant1__ of my report cards before __quant1__ started using and my grades were either all d 's or d 's and f 's .
then i looked at a report card that i got that had all a 's on it .
i was soo high on crystal that semester that i do not even remember most what happened at school or at home .
so i ask do you think drugs can be good for some people ?
i know that no matter what no drug is good for anyone .
this does n't mean that i would go back and change things if i could , because i really do not want to .
i am just wondering how other people feel about this .
@secondchance , i think that drugs can have positives but i think that they 'll rarely come without negatives and whether or not it 's a net positive is hard for anyone to tell , most of all the user .
@secondchance , it is possible to self medicate to a positive outcome . responsible use is required .
for instance a couple of generations of artists have widely used drugs , convinced that the change in consciousness is of great help to their work .
we moderns have no doubt but that it is a good idea to drug people up on __name1__ and anti anxiety drugs and antidepressants , this highly drugged society has no basis to complain about weed and coke .
meth though messes people up big time , so i do n't see a lot of upside to that .
yes , and i 'm one of them .
my life would be impoverished without my __quant2__ glass of wine .
i quite enjoyed the few joints i have tried .
and sometime , when i 'm in a better general mood than i am right now , i 'd like to try __name1__ or __quant1__ of its relatives , maybe magic mushrooms .
to me , consuming drugs is a matter of moderation , not abstinence .
my wife has constant ringing in her ears : noise , a " whooshing " as she describes .
any ideas ? thanks
@robc , that 's tinnitus .
she should see an otorhinolaryngologist ( ear specialist ; ear , nose and throat specialist ) as , if this is recent , there may be things they can do .
i just watched the most fascinating , inspiring , and yet heartbreaking documentary : the half ton man .
obesity is reaching epidemic proportions in the world today .
is there a fat gene ?
science seems to think there is .
many people feel hungry every minute they are awake and fight the fact they know they are literally killing themselves with every bite they take .
__quant1__ man in the documentary lost __quant2__ pounds !
yet , when he reached __quant1__ pounds he celebrated by having a hot dog , which turned into __quant2__ , __quant3__ , etc.
he now is morbidly obese again and is n't ready to go back into rehab at a center that has great success in helping these people .
when i was younger i could eat virtually anything and not gain weight .
i 'm almost __quant1__ and it 's not quite that easy for me to keep my weight to what is comfortable for me .
i am able to do it , but watching this video scared me . __quant1__ woman in the video was actually __quant2__ feet wide when she got help .
i have seen shows on tv where __quant1__ year old children weigh nearly __quant2__ pounds all because their parents want to appease the child and stop their fussing .
does anyone out there have a big problem with their weight ?
how do you combat it ?
is food an addiction ?
is over @-@ eating a disease like drug addiction or alcoholism ?
now , that 's a link ! lol
i think the problem and cure is psychological . they should spend more time on the psycology of it coupled with the surgery .
oh , now there getting into that part .
i watched that documentary on __name1__ a while back .... too bad he 's gained some weight back .
but there 's always hope he 'll get back on track .
besides the obvious medical issues with him , i was disturbed by the co @-@ dependant relationship with his wife .
at his worst , he weighed __quant1__ pounds .
he was unable to even roll over in bed , let alone get to the refrigerator or supermarket ....
he could n't even get to a phone or a computer to order food if you put it __quant1__ feet away from him .
so .... who was feeding his all that crap ?
who was bringing it to him ?
she feels she 's showing love by bringing him to deaths door because he asked for ( or begged or ranted ) for food .
and not just food .... garbage .
i understand love for your spouse , but theirs is not a healthy relationship .
also , in the video , after he had gotten under __quant1__ pounds , __name1__ said " i avoid foods with a lot of fat and sodium "....as he was snacking on individual size bags on salted nuts and potato chips .
in the scene before that ( after his gastic bypass and much weight loss ) , the wife brought him dinner .... __name1__ .
" oh ", she said , " here 's your protein ", as she waved an extra crispy drumstick at him .
my husband loves egg sald .
when i make it , __quant3__ through out __quant1__ out of the __quant2__ yolks , and mix in __quant3__ pound of tofu .... he never knows the difference .
( btw , he 's very thin , but has a heart condition ) .
wifey could maybe take some lessons from me .
doctors have told me i have a full thickness rotator cuff tear and must have surgery or my shoulder will freeze .
looking for information from anyone who has had it or with someone recuperating .
i have heard the recovery is brutally painful .
any tips , suggestions , etc. , about what to expect during __value1__ few days , how to manage , sleep , any info .
i had it done __quant1__ years ago at __name1__ .
i had suffered low grade " bursitis " in __quant1__ shoulder for many years ( probably a worn rotator cuff ) , until one day while working out __quant2__ got a real , full tear .
lots of serious pain with some movements or any strenuous exertion .
my surgery was successful , but it took me several months to regain my range of motion in the shoulder .
i learned that the post op therapy is probably more critical than the surgery itself .
i was determined to restore the range of motion and to return to my old exercise routine , so i in effect took charge of the rehab program and made it clear to the therapist the orthopedic surgeon that i would n't accept less .
in retrospect i believe this was the critical thing , in that the docs . and the therapists take their cues from the patient -- if you passively accept less than full recovery , they will let you go .
if you are determined to go on , they will help .
i have full use of the shoulder and no more pain .
i would do it again .
i hope this is helpful and wish you good luck !
i 'm under erratic , severe stress in my personal life and my colorful , efficient adrenalin glands are playing merry hell with my blood pressure .
i 'm hoping to avoid drugs by losing weight and learning serenity , but meanwhile i 'm supposed to monitor my blood pressure at home .
once upon a time i had a jim @-@ dandy wrist unit that worked perfectly .
then after __quant1__ years of faithful service , it up and died .
now the wrist units at the local drugstores come with a read @-@ outbox that is too wide for my 5 1 @/@ 2 inch wrist .
i 've also tried the wrap @-@ the @-@ upper arm monitors .
these only work about __value1__ % of the time and dealing with them sends my blood pressure up to new heights .
also , because of a lumpectomy i can only use my left arm for b.p. readings .
i 'm left handed , but am making progress in non @-@ dominent @-@ hand dexterity .
can anyone recommend a no @-@ hassle , __name1__ @-@ friendly home blood pressure monitor that will work around bird bones ?
noddy , from your post i assume you have not checked on the models currently on the market .
most companies have fully automatic models that do n't require adjusting it to your arm with every use .
you adjust it once to fit your arm ( you can do this with it off your arm ; it might take __quant1__ tries ) and that 's that .
slip it on your arm . press a button and in less than __quant1__ minute read your b.p. and heart rate .
i 've had an __name1__ for __quant1__ years and have never had a problem .
i think it cost in the vicinity of $ 50-$ 60 .
you can get them a bit cheaper if you are willing to pump it up yourself .
the semi @-@ automatic that i have does the pumping for you .
as i sit here foggy headed and lets face it with most of the symptoms of hypoglycemia i thought i should do something about it .
im trying to start to eat healthily , slowly but surely , which means cutting out processed foods and eating more natural things .
a good start to begin with but not necessarily dealing with hypoglycemia .
it says give up things like caffiene , tobacco , things i dont consume anyway , it says give up wheat , which is bread , which i tend to eat alot of .
i assume we all do , it kind of houses all the other ingredients we need like in sandwiches or wraps , pizza .
basically does anybody have any advice on what to eat or recomend a good book ?
search out a glycemia index , and determine something both edible and low on the list .
add that to your diet , to avoid getting into hypoglycemia .
if it happens anyway , skim ( non fat ) milk will raise the blood sugar about as fast as anything .
indulge in a light bedtime snack , again , something fairly low on the list .
do n't overdo it , though .
i have not yet been diagnosed but i am beginning to suspect hypoglycemia @/@ low blood sugar .
lately i have been very confused , have anxiety , dizziness , fatigued , weak , depressed , and generally low .
i know i need to gain more weight - i lost about __quant1__ pounds suddenly about __quant2__ months ago and have n't been able to gain it back .
how does a doctor diagnose someone with this ?
what tests should i have them run ?
i have been reading about __name1__ , the new __name2__ vaccine that is administered intranasally .
__quant1__ thing that i noticed , is that it is marketed as suitable for people ages __quant2__ @-@ __quant3__ .
i have not seen any material as to why the 50+ population is unsuitable for this vaccine .
anybody know why ?
well , according to that __name1__ link children between __quant1__ and __quant2__ are the most likely to actually get the __name2__ itself and it looks like that was the intended target age group for the development of __name3__ .
they note that it is __value1__ % effective in preventing people in that range from getting the __name1__ at all but people in the __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ range only had lessened symptoms .
it seems the older the patient the less effective the drug .
it is inconceivable that you take a multivitamin in good faith and it wrecks havoc on your health in such a profound way but that is the case .
i " was " taking a __name1__ multivitamin __quant1__ day as suggested on the back label and __quant1__ was waking up with dry mouth so sever __quant1__ could not even swallow .
my skin was getting scaly , my eyes burning and my feet were so dry they begin to develop calluses and crack .
i stopped my vitamin and it is now gone .
what is up __name1__ ?
it is not just __name1__ but any type of multivitamin causes this .
if you search the internet for " dry mouth and multivitamin " you get this idiot named " jade m " on __name1__ that replies that it is " not likely " that a multivitamin is causing this dryness of nearly every cell in the body .
sorry to say jade m whoever you are but you are wrong ...
if you do n't know what you are talking about you should n't be doling out incorrect information in an online medical forum .
my sister is a nurse at a veterans hospital and she complained to her doctor that she was getting dry mouth .
he told her that it was her multivitamin and she cut down her intake of the multivitamin and her dry mouth left completely .
a friend of mine who takes many medications for his heart just came up to me and told me he was getting terrible dry mouth at night and reduced his multivitamin to only a few times __quant1__ week and now no more dry mouth .
in other words if you follow the directions on the back label of your vitamins they will start slowly killing you .
do n't expect paul g. donohue m.d.to help you either .
he basically dismisses this elderly persons claim then tries to get her to take corrective medications .
how typical ...
i get dry mouth too plus my skin gets dry and scaly and when i stop my multivitamin it immediately goes away .
now this is __quant1__ completely unrelated people all coming to the exact same conclusion .
not only can we not trust the general consensus on the internet but we cannot trust people who have phd credentials giving their advice online .
what do we have to dry up and die before we finally figure out what ails us ?
when my sister told this to me i did not really give it much thought .
then i permanently lost __value1__ % of my eyesight due to dry eyes .
then my mouth chronically became dry , skin kept piling up on my feet that i could n't sand it off fast enough to keep up with it , the skin on my hands became scaly and my lips kept cracking and my tongue felt like it had pins and needles poking into it .
i stop the multivitamin and my mouth symptoms are gone , sadly my eyesight is still damaged .
i should have just listened to my sister rather than err , jade m.
my doctor was even prescribing fish oil supplements to correct the dry skin problem which could not even put a dent in the problems being caused by my multivitamin .
i do n't consume a lot of salt in my diet and i am on no other medications or drugs whatsoever .
if you are experiencing dry mouth and take a multivitamin stop the vitamin immediately before you ruin your health irreversibly .
take it only a few times __quant1__ week , if that , and you will realize the vitamins cause this .
i was also told by a pharmacist that other than the antioxidants , a person gets what they need from their diet of most minerals and do not require a multivitamin at all .
so a strictly antioxidant formula is all that is required minus the multivitamin minerals .
please weigh in on this , sorry i am upset about this but i am also troubled now by internet advice that is clearly wrong about this issue and no telling how many others .
tinnitus , vision loss , global cellular degeneration , moisture loss , and even constipation are all caused by general use of multivitamins .
also if you are feeding your children multivitamins you should be highly cautious of this too .
even children should only be given a multivitamin a few times __quant1__ week and not every day .
they should be explained the dangers of regular use of vitamins ( in other words following the prescribed dosage ) .
take it from me who has experienced this first hand , my sister who is a nurse , my friend taking many meds whose dry mouth stopped the very day he cut down on his multivitamin and l.f who was incorrectly advised by , err , donehue .
it is a sad commentary that people have to collectively learn this on their own and that doctors , health specialists and the internet are so out of the loop .
consider that vitamin waters and health food drinks on top of a multivitamin only compound this problem .
i forget what my sister said was causing this , i seem to recall zinc , but i may be wrong about that .
i have to ask her again .
consider if it is visibly destroying your skin it is also destroying your major organs too .
please comment and offer any further advice on this subject .
i just started on a new kind of multivitamin and my body 's been all kinds of crazy .
i used to just take specific vitamins but that got expensive and elaborate and i was missing some things so i switched to a multi .
the multi has calcium and i know from previous experience that calcium tears my stomach up .
i 'm getting older and i know that i need some calcium though .
i do n't have dry mouth but i agree that multivitamins can have unintended consequences .
i have been taking high potency multivitamins for almost __quant1__ years .
i have not know any side effects .
__quant1__ thing , though is to not have certain foods too close to the time of the taking , because certain __quant1__ can interact .
for instance , __quant1__ am taking something now that advises to not take regular __name1__ for __quant1__ hour on either side of taking that product .
it suggests discontinuing the __quant1__ hour release of __name1__ for as long as that product is being used .
i have to constantly make such comparisons to make sure it all works .
i am on very high dose __name1__ , besides my green multiple , that is very concentrated compared top wimpy __name2__ .
i never had dry mouth until this high dose of c , so i am assuming it is the c.
i use it as an antihistamine to control my __name1__ .
i have overactive mast cells that start pulling water into my gut when i run out of __name1__ and magnesium ( this i think was caused by taking a round of vaccines in __year1__ , and the studies i found online confirm that mercury in the adjuvants often do cause increased histamine production ) .
so __quant3__ am on __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ mg of __name1__ 4x __quant6__ and __quant4__ @-@ __quant5__ mg magnesium 4 x __quant3__ .
this is a lot , but i have learned it does control my bowels .
the normal person would get colon blow from these doses , and it firms me up to normal .
this is ultimately an adrenal issue , as the adrenals are throwing out huge amounts of electrolytes and i am sure other stuff , so until i realized this i was in constant loose bowels losing my nutrients .
but it has caused dry mouth .
i do n't think it is as bad as some i have read here .
there are some archaelogists who believe that __quant1__ sites in __name1__ could be the world 's earliest cities .
__name1__ and __name2__ in the ne of __name3__ may have existed back in 3700bc .
seems plausible .
__name1__ is generally considered to be the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world .
it 's mentioned by name in __name5__ as a place where __name1__ stopped on his way to __name2__ from __name3__ ( in modern @-@ day __name4__ ) .
according to this , __name1__ citizens can now be arrested and detained indefinitely without trial .
does that mean that anyone can be taken and put into a hole forever without justification ?
if so , i think it 's scary .
but who decides that the person was actually a member of or working for __name1__ ?
what court can review that decision ?
well , the verdict just came in .
guilty of involuntary manslaughter .
the judge would not let him be released until sentencing either .
the judge said his behavior was wreckless and the community could be in harm 's way . ( not his exact words ) .
i am glad he is losing his license .
no matter what , he never should have given __name1__ that propofol .
the man practiced here for many years .
the local tv news is running nothing but outrage over the conviction .
not __quant1__ word in favor of it .
the local __name1__ channel featured a legal expert who derided the trial , calling it a travesty , making doctors afraid to treat patients and so forth .
he seems to think a " proper " court would have let murray go free .
an increasing proportion of __name1__ children are so severely obese as to be at immediate risk for life @-@ threatening complications including __name2__ .
some will become candidates for treatment at newly established pediatric surgical weight loss programs throughout the country .
as an alternative approach , involvement of state protective services might be considered , including placement into foster care in carefully selected situations .
ultimately , government can reduce the need for such interventions through investments in the social infrastructure and policies to improve diet and promote physical activity among children .
severe obesity in children -- is that a form of child abuse ?
should the state step in and save these kids from their parents ?
david ... you 're so not looking at the big picture .
if this current trend continues , a whole generation or __quant1__ will be lost .
considering that we are globally competing against __name1__ and __name2__ who so far do n't suffer this epidemic , we will fall farther behind in almost every aspect .
these next generations will become a major burden on our health care system .
prevention is needed now not later when it will most likely not work .
cheaper to fix it now then to let it cripple the entire economy at a later date .
i live in __name1__ and i signed an affiliation agreement 12 @/@ __month1__ which states that i was to pay __quant1__ fee to the owners .
the owners said " not " to pay until my business had picked up .
although my business is struggling , i have tried several times to start paying this fee .
each time the owners said " no " do n't worry about .
we have now parted ways , for both personal and professional reasons , and now they are taking me to small claims court for the affiliation fee they said i did n't have to pay plus their legal fees ( i am being bullied ) .
has anyone dealt with a situation like this ?
i thought a verbal agreement would override a written agreement , but is that hard to prove ?
i mean obviously the proof is that they are suing me for back fees that i have not been paying because business has been slow .
please , help or share your story .
it sounds like there is more than what you have posted .
did you break a lease or agreement with them ?
leave early ?
it sounds like they were waiving certain fees , with the understanding that you were going to stay for the long haul .
if you left early , then they now want all their fees .
a written agreement trumps a verbal agreement .
a written agreement is hard proof .
without that it 's your word against their word .
you should have put the money is escrow if you felt uncomfortable with the arrangement .
my newspaper has an article today on animal hoarders , listing some signifigant recent cases :
__quant1__ woman lived on an old school bus with __quant2__ dogs , __quant3__ cats and __quant4__ chickens .
__quant1__ man had __quant2__ dogs .
another had __quant1__ cats .
__quant2__ weeks ago , animal services confiscated __quant1__ cats living with a man in a van .
most hoarders live in unimaginable filth .
( i did n't want to post the photos because they are really gross .)
most of these people are charged with animal abuse and neglect and they are fined and jailed .
do you think these people are criminals ?
i watched __name1__ ( way too late at night this weekend ) and saw a __name2__ .
they busted a hoarder with __quant1__ dogs and confiscated __quant2__ of them ( i think legally in fla you can have __quant3__ ) .
the dogs were in such bad shape , some could n't walk because their nails were so long , most were flea infested and had been sleeping in their own feces .
there were __quant1__ sets of puppies in the house and as they panned around the house , it appeared that there were at least __quant2__ other sets of puppies in the making .
the woman was not prosecuted as long as she was willing to give up the amount needed to take her back to the legal limit .
and they checked up on her after that .
apparently the media ran a story about it and over 40 dogs were adopted the __value1__ day they were available .
i go for mentally ill as well , but like freeduck said , sometimes the only way to get them treatment is to prosecute .
they just told this woman they would keep checking up on her ( randomly so she could n't hide pets like she was when they were rounding them up ) and as long as she had only __quant1__ , she was fine .
that seems reasonable to me since no dogs were dead , no dogs were starving , they just needed more attention .
it was a much better story than the dog chained to a tree for __quant1__ weeks in __name1__ heat that finally succumbed ... made me cry .
now those people should be tied to a tree with no food and water and see how they do ...
we had our own local " cat lady " who made the newspaper headlines a couple of decades ago .
she lived in a filthy , almost uninhabitable house surrounded by cats , cats , cats .
many people tried to help her , but she made it impossible for anyone to give her effective assistance even in the face of having her home condemned .
and that 's what eventually happened .
her house was declared a public nuisance and the city tore it down .
i 'm pretty sure this old lady had more than just a few screws loose .
__quant1__ saw her many years ago at a local supermarket .
she was wearing a drab winter coat and a large colorful scarf around her head with her unkempt gray wig hairs sticking out .
she was slumped against a wall and the store personnel had called an ambulance .
it was a pathetic sight .
i think it is a kind of depression myself , where one lets go of a lot of effort to keep up with __quant1__ life except to ' care ' for animals , and then is overwhelmed but sees no way out of it - except that they do , i gather , start again .
a kind of compulsion .
not that i do n't want them stopped .
is this a kind of ocd ? a pre @-@ alzheimers ?
there is something to be said for humane institutional care , and i am not talking about the dogs .
tricky subject , on which i can see several sides .
please - this is not a thread about the case , as such , i find those threads concerning - but about some of the differences between the __name1__ , and some other countries ' practices - and their effect .
for instance : i ) in __name1__ , and , i believe , __name2__ at the very least , the name of a juvenile involved in a criminal matter is not revealed , whether they be alleged victim , or alleged perpetrator , except in very special circumstances
( eg they have been kidnapped , and police seek public help to find them - or they have been murdered - or if they are alleged to have committed a very serious crime and are being tried as adults , or if it is in some way in the public interest .)
to these non @-@ us eyes , it is very shocking to see the name and photograph of the young man alleged to have been abused by __name1__ splashed all over the media -
here , juveniles are protected to the point that , on the few occasions i have accompanied a minor who was raped or sexually abused to court , while she @/@ he gave testimony - if the offender ( these were cases where , oddly , a conviction was obtained , so i do not say " alleged " offender ) was also a minor , it was a big deal to be allowed in to be a support person for the victim , because i would hear the name of the offender .
what do people think of the __name1__ practice ?
what is the reason for it ?
which would you prefer ?
what do you think is the impact on young people so identified ?
ii ) the media circus .
here , both defence and prosecution are very limited as to what they can say about a case that is before the courts . the matter is considered sub judice .
occasionally , with high profile cases , the police will " leak " things - and @/@ or the media will attempt , within the letter of the law , to try a case in the media ( the __name1__ case was a terrible example of both these occurrences ) -
but the organised propaganda campaigns that i think i detect in the __name1__ are not generally present .
full details are generally releasable only after the trial .
again , the spectacle is very shocking to these non @-@ us eyes .
i presume it is allowed because of an interpretation of free speech ?
do people think it aids justice ? that it is societally positive ? what do you think ?
iii ) this is unrelated - but , do people think this is going to be another black v white case , and do you think that high profile non @-@ caucasian people still - despite their wealth and power - are unfairly treated in the __name1__ justice system ?
i would think that , similarly to here , that poorer and obscure people of colour would tend to be - but i am interested in views re people who have achievedfame and fortune .
judging the __name1__ legal system based on what goes on in , say , the __name2__ case is probably a bad idea .
i 've served on jury duty several times and came away highly impressed with how seriously everybody took their various responsibilities .
a case like __name1__ 's , alas , or the __name2__ case betray many standards .
the media have some role in this , as do glory @-@ hounding attorneys on both sides .
i 'm sure , for example , that a minor 's name should never be publicized in a case like this .
i 'm trying to pay as little attention to this case as possible , because i think it 's more a freak show than anything else .
please do n't judge our system on the basis of the __name1__ trial !
we have very strict publication bans around identity of abused minors in __name1__ .
the person charged often cannot be identified , as their name , and the details of the relationship to the child , would mean the child could possibly be identified .
sleeping next to the elephant means we 've probably become a bit jaded to the circus . but the laws are much tighter here .
i would be extraordinarily happy not to make such a judgment , d'artagnan ! !!! but - it is allowed to happen !
would the name of the child , for instance , normally be suppressed ?
how often do cases become media circuses ?
i guess what i am getting at is the different laws on such matters ...
interesting to have such differences in the systems of countries that grew so similarly , ehbeth .
we seem much more like you guys - but , __quant1__ suppose , the __name1__ invented its laws after a revolution - we inherited them after centuries of slow evolution with no cataclysm , and made changes slowly .
i think but i 'm not completely sure if you can print any name of a sexual abuse victim in __name1__ without the express permission of the victim .
you cannot print the name of any minor whether the victim or perpetrator of any crime , except in very special @/@ rare circumstances where a minor is at large and a suspected danger to the community or themselves .
a court order is needed in these cases and once the minor is apprehended the name and or picture must not be printed again , ever .
news outlets are rarely allowed to print anything specific in these cases as well .
in cases of family abuse the names are rarely printed , if ever , in order to protect the victim .
i had no idea the victim in the __name1__ cases was publicized .
i have seen pictures of his previous victim which i though was pretty appalling but generally the faces have been smudged out .
what i hope will happen here is that people will come along to present the case for allowing the names to be made public , because it is incomprehensible to me -
but there must be reasons for the __name1__ system to be the way it is on these matters .
it is n't as though people in the __name1__ are not interested in and critical of their own system - gotta be a reason ...
i think they are getting ready to bring the __value1__ miner up .
over __quant1__ feet up , in a little tube , through a little tunnel .
on __name1__ i saw a picture they showed of the faces of the miners , and i saw at least a couple guys that look way too big to fit in that thing .
i guess they 'll be sucking in their guts .
wow , __quant1__ days .
that 's like a full season of __name1__ .
i guess the whole rescue is supposed to take about __quant1__ days , if their estimates are correct and nothing goes wrong .
and the whole thing will be watched live all over the world .
here 's a place where there are some livestreams if you want to check it out .
__name1__ could learn a lot from the __name2__ people as the __quant1__ miners are rescued .
they came together to support and save the miners ' lives .
so much better than the political party fighting going on over the coming elections in the __name1__
i have a question .
the __value1__ man , __value1__ of the rescuers , must be able to lock the rescue tube 's door correctly from the inside ?
i can understand how he could hook up the oxygen pack and other devises , but i can n't figure out how he can lock the door so it does n't come loose if no one is there to do it from the outside .
he will have to hold it shut with a handle or maybe a bungee cord held on the inside .
good question .
looks like these guys are gonna get out in time to do their __name1__ shopping
i am sorry ; but i thought chili was part of __name1__ ...
one of them at least ...
they come in __quant1__ 's you know ... __name1__ , and __name2__ ... that sort of thing ...
in any event , i do not know the answer to your question ...
it would seem that for most doors , there is a handle on the inside and the outside ...
just like hammers have claws so you can go both ways with a nail ...
speaking from experience , it is damned difficult some times not having reverse on a motor cycle ...
you can n't stop riding without thinking about riding later ...
here i am , and how do i get out..
i 'm watching on the telly yet another shooter ( __name1__ fla ) news says __quant1__ victims taken to hospital .
you know what david is going to tell you in a few minutes : if the others had guns to protect themselves , they all would be dead by now .
that 's how gun logic works , my dear dys .
guess all the gun crazy psychotics are flipping out of the woodwork .
yeah , and then i 'm a gun owner .
and your """" enlightened """" solution is ?
my " enlightened " solution is for everyone to determine who might become a potential shooter and kill them before they are able to harm anyone .
does my sarcasm equate adequately to yours ?
i 'm talking specifically about the showing of the contents of the package that he sent to __name1__ .
i realize that this stuff will probably come out anyway , and that the public really really wants to see what was in that package , but is n't it also in a way glorifying @/@ validating the guy 's actions and giving him exactly what he wanted ?
for instance , the image of him pointing a gun at the camera is on just about every news site i see online , and the video clips of his rantings are starting to show up everywhere as well . and his writing .
i realize how fascinating it is to try to get inside this nutball 's head , but is there any way to put the news out there about him without giving him rock star status ?
is it even possible ?
i wonder how long until this stuff shows up on __value1__ or __quant1__ of those other disgusting sites .
i think there can be details ( what happened when , who tried to do what , etc.) without spreading his own propaganda . because that 's what it is .
he stage @-@ managed this -- he wanted the badass stuff out there , he wanted that lasting image .
just show a small picture of who he was , the original one was fine .
the rest is unnecessary , and articles bbb and nimh have linked to argue convincingly that the propaganda is downright dangerous .
the __name1__ public has reached the point in our culture , that the news that gets the most coverage is the news that plays to the lowest common denominator amongst us .
think about it . for weeks , there was __name1__ and the baby . then it was __name2__ . now all we hear about is that murderous nutjob who acted on his sickest delusions .
it is like the newspapers and tv want to beat out the supermarket rags . ugh !
i 've been enjoying the __name2__ blog , primarily by __name1__ , who i 'm used to reading when he writes about art.
but he 's joined by several other good writers who are apparently hanging around the __name1__ typing away as they feel like it .
i like all the different viewpoints .
have always like __name1__ 's writing , but can n't read him in the paper lately because he 's now in the __name2__ select group that you have to pay for to get access to , even on the day of the article .
my favorite writer on the blog is __name1__ , he seems to have my eyes , if i had his .
i 'm enjoying the play by play , as it were , so much that i want to see if i can go back and read the blog on the __name1__ .
probably not , as so much time has passed .
anybody on a2k following this ?
going to the matches ?
i do follow international tennis -- __value1__ of the __value1__ things i want to glance over on the morning newspaper .
not going to the matches , though ?
well , so are you following the __name1__ (http://www.usopen.org/)?
who are your fave players ?
yeah , she sure was a tennis prodigy .
she 's always lacked the killer serve that is a key to today 's power game , though .
if she did n't have it in her heyday , she 's not going to have it now in the twilight of her career .
hey , hope your day is going well !
i have a question for anyone who feels that want to answer .
i have been watching a bit of ' rhythmic gymnastics ' on __name1__ ... i just find it amazing ... it 's very cool .
i do n't have children , but when i get to that stage , i 'd love a daughter of mine to take part in this really cool sport .
my question though is , is it true or just a myth that while all this crazy flexibility at a young age is nice , at old age they will be in pain and not able to move at all ?
if it is true , i 'd prefer not to have any part in it , but if it 's not true , it would be great to know .
can anyone help ?
i 'm no expert , but __name1__ comenechi , the famous __name2__ gymnast , has no health problems from her gymnastics days though her former gymnast husband is wracked with arthritis .
thanks for you quick reply .
could it be that different people react to it in different ways ?
maybe you just enjoy it while you do , and if you find it painful afterwards ... bad luck , if not ... great !
has anyone else got any other thoughts ?
i 'm not familiar with rhythmic gymnastics , but i know both gymnasts and dancers are prone to on @-@ the @-@ job injury -- and the effects of those injuries can add up .
the behaviour of __name2__ cricket fans is of more concern than the thousands of spirited __name3__ members set to descend upon our shores for this summer 's __name4__ series , say __name1__ 's police .
the number of __name1__ fans travelling to australia is expected to easily surpass the __quant1__ who came for the __year1__ @-@ 03 __name3__ series because of last year 's victory and because of an online ticketing fiasco that saw thousands of __name1__ fans nabbing __name3__ tickets meant for __name2__ .
there has been some discussion here about the __name1__ .
not the test series , the actual ones .
apparently the aussies ( a devious lot ) have said that when they win the series ( that 's if they do , but they do n't think that way ) they want to take the small urn from its permanent place at __name1__ back to oz .
__name1__ say , on your bikes cobber , because that urn is a gift , not a trophy , and it stays where it is .
what say the aussies now ?
i 'm sitting here pulling my hair out because my roomate is watching the __name1__ on tv . i 'd rather drink battery acid than watch golf .
while semi @-@ watching , i just realized something : while the golfer is setting up his shot , and about to swing , all the fans get very quiet for them . then i thought about fans at sports games( golf is n't a sporting event , it 's a hobby ) , and they scream , yell , and do their best to annoy the opposing team 's players and throw them off their game .
why the hell do golfers escape that aspect ? the pressure and ability to block stuff out adds to the challenge . why are they so special ?
this made me just hate watching golf on tv even more .
i love golfing .
do n't understand watching it .
also do n't understand courses that use carts .
none of that new @-@ fangled crap for me .
walk , and carry your bloody clubs .
so there are others out there other than myself that hate golf and believe its not a sport ? thats wonderful !
golf is a sport ... an incredibly boring sport ...
tennis players get the same ' silent treatment ' from spectators -- not exactly sure why ...
bite me , slappy .
hatred of golf is for people with brain deficiencies .
__quant1__ other thing that must annoy you . in all other sports ( yeah , golf is a sport ) ... there are refs and umps and all that . and the people playing the sports argue with those officials all the time .
in golf ... you gotta call fouls on yourself . and golfers do !
there ain't nothing in the world better than golf . ( well ... maybe __quant1__ thing . but even that , you can eventually get enough of . you can never get enough of golf .)
will __name1__ ever return to the __name2__ ?
ever ? yeah , next season .
it 's looking like he is out for the year , though depedning on his rehabilitation , he may try to be available for the playoffs .
it 's tough to say though .
my money is on __name1__ to return next year .
i do n't think he 's willing to let the previous season 's __name1__ be his last .
or it is possible you will stand there with a frozen grin on your face , unable to say anything remotely intelligent .
we can help you !
several of us a2k'ers have created a support group to painlessly guide you towards appearing knowledgeable even if , like many of us , you are clueless .
they are called the wildcard games .
you will need to invest a grand total of __quant1__ minutes . total . max .
please indicate , by noon on saturday , __month1__ __day1__ th , your picks on these __quant1__ games :
__name1__ @ __name2__
__name1__ @ __name2__
__name1__ @ __name2__
__name1__ @ __name2__
__name1__ aggravated me no end in __name2__ ( __name4__ was my quarterback ) , so this seems to me a perfectly good reason to pick __name3__ , who also aggravated me , but not as much .
i 'm placing my faith that the jet 's defense will kick in one more time .
plus i like it that no one else seems to have faith in __name1__ .
besides this wild card round is just fodder for the real games when the __name1__ start playing and ultimately take the whole burrito , ( enchiladas are n't classy enough for __name2__ and the gang ) .
instead of a coin toss - and because i know absolutely nothing about football @- i 'm going to do it by which city i know @/@ like better and see how well i do .
so my picks will be :
__name1__
__name1__
__name1__
__name1__
just as an experiment to begin with , but i am fairly competititive in spirit , so if one of my teams makes it to the __name1__ - i 'll watch it instead of the __name2__ marathon and eat me some chicken wings and drink a beer or two .
sounds fun to me...can't hurt .
is there a prize ?
in an article in __name6__ 's " __name5__ " newspaper , __name1__ , a __name3__ laureate and member of the department of chemistry at the __name2__ __name6__ , recommends that __name4__ farmers be allowed( you might even say " be encouraged ") to grow poppies ( opium ) legally .
he argues that there is a shortage of painkilling medication , particularly in poor , __value1__ world countries , and that __name1__ could supply the needed poppies at a lower price than commercially produced painkillers .
i saw the interview he gave on __name1__ @-@ __name1__ recently and he seems to know what he is talking about .
as he put it : " the afghan farmer has to make a living to feed his - often large - family .
we can force him to produce the poppies illegally and feed into the illegal drug market or we can buy the poppies from him and help provide pain @-@ killing drugs ."
as i posted sometime ago , countries such as :france , __name1__ and __name2__ are permitted to grow poppies legally for the production of drugs - why not allow the afghan farmers the same privilege ?
have a look at the article and see if you agree with him or not .
the problem with poppy cultivation is n't the growing of the crop itself .
the problem is oversight and marketing .
opiates have legitimate medicinal uses .
unfortunately , the product of the papver __name1__ plant has far more monetary value on the black market than when sold to legitimate pharmaceutical manufacturers .
thanks for the article and the background - i read both .
there would be problems though .
the criminal element that currently buy the crop are still going to try and get their hands on it , so the crops would need to be guarded .
that 's going to cost a fair bit and probably result in bloodshed .
hottest world conflicts in the computer near you ! live ! entertaining ! wild !
the future of the news reality shows , or whatever should one call it .
__name1__ touring the world 's conflict zones with digital technology that will allow him to blog and transmit images and videos from war ridden areas __quant1__ .
one can contact him there , or chat with him live on the website .
now while i know he 's doing it voluntarily and probably for a shootload of money , i have to say i find the idea of such a project odd and somewhat disconcerning .
will it start a new wave of journalists seeking out the most dangerous situations to sell their goods ?
competition on who can go the farthest ?
and will that encourage the sides in conflict to up their performance , so to speak , getting international live coverage straight from the front ?
especially if there will be more and more __name1__ sites'es roaming the world ?
thousands of journalists already do seek out war zones , sure .
but this is taking it to a whole new level , i think .
anyway , i 'm confused about how i feel about it .
i will surely look in often to see where he 's at and will be curious about the reports and live videos .
it has a voyeuristic element to it , does n't it ?
ah , what is this world coming to .
and what does the future of journalism hold for us ?
can we control it in any way ?
what do you think ?
gus , that 's what 's making me uncomfortable .
it just seems like a stoopid idea to me .
but i won't deny that i am also curious , although it makes me feel kinda dirty .
partaking in making a violent conflict a part of entertainment culture .
well , more so than it already is . yecchh .
everything in life has a positive , and a negative side .
the good thing about this is that they might be able to record what really is happening in certain areas of the world in case the governments of the world tell us different .
if they make money good for them !
if they survive many of these men come back home changed , and sometimes not for the better .
they could also come back wounded or sick .
to me , it 's a good thing to be able to choose how your going to die when it 's for a good cause .
there are incidents where the bastards in charge decide it would be best for a certain reporter to " die in conflict "
__name1__ better tread carefully .
of course , i imagine he 'll have quite an entourage and that might ensure his safety from the more devious sorts .
the __name1__ or at least some of the members threaten sanctions .
sanctions , what sanctions could the __name1__ impose , refuse to purchase the lifeblood of industry " oil "?
__name1__ could on the other hand cut their production and cause the price of that commodity to go through the roof .
is the threat of sanctions just another instance where the __name1__ and the __name2__ is just blowing smoke ?
it 's blowing smoke as it 's the people who will end up suffering from any such move .
if the __name1__ really wants to make a difference , they could threaten to pass a resolution ! !!!!
ooooooh ! that ought to scare ' em...."
and __name1__ is clamering the loudest .
does he , i wonder , think that would be his excuse to invade .
it would be wmd 's all over again .
i can n't believe that even the crew that " owns " the __name1__ at the present time would do something as rash and ill conceived .
let me start by saying that i love __name1__ .
i 've been there a few times in the last __quant1__ or __quant2__ years and have become familiar with its people and customs and geography and unique challenges .
each time i 've visited , i 've noticed immense , fast @-@ paced progress , both economically and socially .
since my __value1__ visit there a network of well @-@ built highways has been built , enabling european and internal tourism and commerce to flourish .
i 've witnessed cell phones come on the market and virtually explode .
high speed internet is available .
house building and land development is through the roof .
agricultural technology has taken off and enabled farmers to be profitable and efficient , as well as increasing the availability of affordable food to all __name1__ .
my aim for this thread is to periodically discuss new developments and economic initiatives in __name1__ as they come about in the news , as well as any other news that is deemed curious or interesting .
i 'm interested in __name1__ .
i know there are some cells there of folks who want to cause havoc but that is presumably not the whole population .
the country has seemed attractive to me for __quant1__ .
at the least , i am interested in hearing more about it .
don , could you be more specific about why __name1__ is to be avoided ?
this all reminds me of myself sitting at a train station in __name1__ at about __time1__ @:@ __time1__ a.m . __quant1__ morning .
my husband and i wandered in after buying our train tickets to get cappuccini and dolci before the ride ... and shared a table with __quant1__ tourists from the __name1__ .
on my right was a table of what turned out to be moroccan laborers .
my xhub and the tourers were talking away about something and i glanced over at the ( moroccans ) and we started talking in poor __name2__ , which is how i found out they were from __name1__ .
very polite sleepy early morning nice conversation.. i turned to the others and the lady said , " dear , you musn't talk with them , they are dangerous ."
i can n't remember what i said , but it was short , succinct .
that was a long time ago .
not every immigrant from far away lands is the devil in disguise , and neither are all of us .
well said , jln !
__quant3__ have n't been there myself but my __quant1__ sons and a friend went a couple of years ago .
they said a ) it was one of the most beautiful places they had been and b ) it was the place in the world they had been most hassled and cheated .
i think , too , that as __quant1__ young men travelling together , they were looked upon as a challenge by local youth .
they said there was fighting amongst kids in the street and this seemed to be normal and tolerated .
so it is a society with a very male testosterone @-@ rich style .
the shops run by women were altogether less hassly , more friendly .
__quant1__ thing they found particularly hard to deal with was other young men attaching themselves to their group and being undislodgeable ( a nwe word and it 's only __time1__ am ! ) .
my eldest who is especially friendly and tolerant tried to make friends with these people but in the end they all wanted something .
that can be dispiriting for the open @-@ minded and open @-@ hearted .
but they enjoyed their stay generally , would certainly not avoid it in future .
as for lumping all __name1__ countries together as a no go area - what complete nonsense !
as we 're going to __name1__ and __name2__ at the end of this month , and expect to have a wonderful trip as independent travellers , i am definitely making a political statement -
i do not lump all __name1__ together , and believe that __value1__ % are friendly to travellers .
most are undoubtedly anti @-@ __name1__ and anti @-@ __name2__ , but that is not a sentiment confined to the __name3__ .
my engagement ring @/@ wedding ring and other personal ring along with my husband 's wedding ring was stolen .
at least we assume so .
we went camping and put them together in the car .
after camping and coming home we searched high and low and could not find them .
we called the campgrounds and the owners said they had cleaned our campsite and did not find anything .
so we had to assume some one stole them .
we did have the car unlocked at times so it is a definate possibility .
really stinks at it was just our anniversary right before .
yep , that stinks .
we were robbed one time right before __name1__ .
came home , and the basement door had been kicked in .
all they took were wrapped __name1__ gifts , and all of my husband 's socks .
sounds funny now , but at the time i felt very violated at the thought of strangers going through my house .
@mags314772 ,
yes i can say the __quant1__ thing was at least it was n't in my house .
the idea of some one going through your house is as bad as them taking __name1__ presents .
wow , the afghanis are in for a life @-@ changing shock to their culture and way of life .
tribal leaders , international corporations , international governments and bordering neighbors will all be vying with each other and the __name1__ people for a piece of the action .
it will be interesting to watch who takes what sides .
will __name1__ and __name2__ now side with the __name3__ to take over the country and exploit the riches ?
will the __name1__ help the __name2__ people to learn from our mistakes and protect their natural environment from strip mining ?
will __name1__ queda now return to the country to enrich themselves with the profits ?
will the lithium deposits take away from efforts by __name1__ and others to invest in and invent research and development in improved battery storage for the very young renewable clean energy industry in the u.s ?
i dont think that any vast deposits found in one land that barely exists as a state and has almost no industry will be a setup for a despotic regime or a surge of __name1__ takeover of provinces within which are these deposits .
since much of it lies in the mountainous regions of the west and southwest , these are already the subject of the new campaign against a resurfacing __name1__ .
these minerals , especially the lithium , will need major processing before its in a commercial state for batteries .
long term development for all kinds of batteries for entire new gizmos ( not just __name1__ ) will be based on better and better lithium cells .
most of the worlds recoverable deposits lie in __name1__ lake deposits and in our own __name2__ in vast quartz deposits .
if they found deposits of rhodium and platinum itd be a major reason to enter negotiations to help em develop their resources .
you can have all the rear metals in the world in your country , but the supporting infrastructer 's must be in place , i.e. roads , power plants , process facilties , water , tons and tons of water , chemical suppliers , etc.
so what may appear as a rich mineral bonanza , will be shot down for now and the forseable future , because the cost of extraction , is larger that any profit margin .
the administrative and legislative branches of our government can n't agree on how to make a dent in our deficits .
the solution ?
go on vacation for __quant1__ month and appoint a bipartisan group of senators and representatives to try to work out some sort of plan .
their mission is to reduce next year 's deficit by $ 1.2tn over the next __quant1__ years .
they must come up with a plan by __name1__ - roughly __quant3__ days - that __quant1__ of the __quant2__ members can agree on .
if they fail , there will be across the board cuts .
if they succeed , their plan must pass the __name1__ and the __name2__ with no alterations .
i , too , am skeptical , edgar .
the __quant2__ __name3__ and __quant2__ repubs from the __name2__ seem to be intractably committed to their __name3__ ' more extreme wings .
the senators are being described as " dealmakers , " willing to compromise at the end .
we will have to see .
in the meantime , if any of you find biographies of the __quant1__ members of the super committee , please link or write your own profile of them .
i 've said elsewhere that i do n't think they 're expected to accomplish anything .
they may put out a proposal but it will probably fail in one chamber or the other .
neither chamber can come to consensus on substantive reforms , imo , and the triggers will be pulled .
the triggers were specifically chosen because each one is desirable to one party and not anethema to the other .
it never was a good idea and only seemed to be a good idea to the morons .
there was never any reason to think that this was going to work , and now that it will not they are going to try to defuse the trigger ... but that might not work either .
i dont know what the __name1__ odds of gutting the __name2__ is but i put it at around __value1__ % .
it was always going to happen at some point , but maybe __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ years down the line , not now .
if this happens it will be a major breaking of faith with the __name1__ people .
millions of __name1__ went to war for america , and came back broken or otherwise gave up a lot , and now we look to take a huge chunk of their hide because __name2__ no longer works .
this , folks , is going to be a problem .
edit : " delay and pray " has not worked in __name1__ , and it will not work in __name2__ .
in both places we see from our so called leaders a massive refusal to step up to the plate .
bullshit ! !! we are our own people .
the reason we are fighting the worlds wars is because the very rich who dont want to pay their share of taxes want the protection of the government for the wealth and jobs they have imported to other countries .
what the majority of the u.s citizens get in return is nothing but a lack of jobs and a reduction in our ability to feed our families .
time to plug yourself in for a recharge , youre starting to run down .
if you wanna defeat __name1__ , seems to me you need a candidate with something between their ears .
all i see is bozo and friends on the __name1__ side .
( hint : id vote for a __name1__ if one of substance showed up , im not too thrilled with the job __name2__ did .
i think he wasted his capital on the health care right at the beginning of the worst economic situation weve seen in our lifetimes .
unfortunately , you cannot really think that any of the present gaggle of __name1__ candidates have got substance ) .
thus the analysis that i have put up on __name2__ in multiple places that the __name1__ federal government is corrupt , and is run by the corporate class .
we see the oppression of the people by the government in other areas besides economics though , for instance i have pointed out how this oppression is woven onto our sex law .
the oppressors should not get too comfy , as oppressors the world over are finding out they get over thrown by force of public will .
the oppressors of the __name1__ people will eventually suffer the same fate ...
where is __name1__ " __name1__ " __name1__ when we need him --- again ?
the greatest irony i 've seen here at __name1__ hawkeye is although i agree with on the statement that the __name4__ is an oligarchy or a plutocracy i believe you have foolishly drunk the __name2__ @-@ __name2__ to think the __name3__ is genuine in it 's pursuit to save the country from " our oppressors " when every move they propose is a basic tenet to strengthen the status quo .
clearly you are too blinded by your personal selfishness and greed to see and feel the rain falling on your head from your __name1__ overlords .
governments exist for a reason .
progressive governments exist and should continue to exist in order to protect it 's citizens from the raiding and looting hordes of the multibillion dollar conglomerates and banking institutions who themselves exist in order to set up a select small population into extreme wealth and power .
i am not of the __name1__ , i am a radical leftist formerly a revolutionary currently a __name2__ .
it could be argued that a better word is collectivist ...
i strongly support libertarian political actions because i want to see individuals once again free enough from government oppresion that they can choose to come together in collective effort .
what we have now is a sham __name1__ impossed by a government which is owned by the coporate class , whos only mission is to grab more wealth .
we are free from government oppression .
now if we can free ourselves from our __quant1__ dollar overlords perhaps we can enjoy real freedom and get rid of our bought politicians .
the euro countries are afraid to let __name1__ go bankrupt , because it will be followed by __name2__ and __name3__ .
if that happens , the euro 's value will drop to unimaginable levels , and inflation will hit all their countries .
the __name1__ euro policies continue to exacerbate the problems for __name2__ and the other euro countries with huge deficits .
__name1__ and __name2__ are trying their best to prop up __name3__ with more loans and forgiving of loans , but that seems like a losing proposition when __name3__ really does n't have an economy that can pay back the loans they already have .
it seems like desperation times for the euro zone countries , but the majority are in no position to assist __name1__ with their growing deficit .
how long will this plugging of holes in the dam last ?
__name1__ and __name2__ are in no position to save all of them when the water 's rush gets stronger by the month ( growing deficits ) .
__name1__ 's debt is __value1__ % of gdp .
how will they survive ?
i believe we 're on the rim of an economic maelstrom .
__name1__ is only the latest symptom of a financial disease that has become pandemic .
i believe that , too .
rather like an individual who works hard , produces useful work , and saves for the future suddenly finding himself wiped out because of the acts of a central bank , somewhere .
you guys are depressing me .
can n't i just go back to blissful ignorance ?
after __name1__ , the recovery was fast .
there was pent up demand for everything after the war , because most civilians earned money building our war machines for __quant1__ years , and there was hardly any consumer goods to buy .
even food was put on rations .
what was " funny " to some degree was the " cheap " junk we imported from __name1__ , because __name2__ were ready to spend money .
i remember lighters from __name1__ were made from soda pop cans , and they must have sold millions of those .
it appears a global recession is on its way .
a bush league president and political party should never be near the steering wheel of the __name1__ economy .
their reckless policies and ideology can only lead backwards to a __century1__ th or __century2__ th century society of robber barons and ideological cutthroats .
it 's too late ; we 've been a recession many months ago ; most families could not continue to live their lifestyles of a couple of years ago because food and fuel costs have increased to the point most could not keep up with those higher costs .
as family members lost their jobs and homes , many also lost their health insurance .
that 's a biggie for most families .
you can listen to our government about " not being in a recession , " but i see it different .
some important cricket is going to be played out in the next coupla months :
__name1__ takes on __name2__ ( or rather australian spectators take on __name3__ ) ; __name4__ sweats it out with __name5__ ; __name6__ prepare to face __name7__ .
there 's lots to talk about .
would the ozzies and indians ( __name1__ are allowed , too ) want to talk over a beer or __quant1__ ?
i 'm here !
glad they gave __name1__ a run .
the __name3__ test in __name2__ is aus vs __name1__ .
i went to the last aus @-@ __name1__ test .
we arrived , and the scoreboard read __name1__ 7 @-@ 705 . aarrggghhh !
i took a photo of it .
was still a draw , though . __name1__ 's last __name2__ test .
hope that does n't happen again !
australian rock legend __name1__ has died this morning after suffering a major heart attack overnight .
__name1__ , __quant1__ , died in the early hours of the morning after he was rushed to __name3__ __name2__ at __time1__ am ( __timezone1__ ) , a spokesman has said .
did he do anything a non @-@ aussie may recognise ?
__name1__ moved to the __name2__ in __year1__ .
children of the sun was released in __year1__ top twenty .
__name1__ headlined his own sold out tours through __year1__ and 80 .
sometime there abouts his record lable went belly up .
__name1__ assumed the rights .
lived as fast as he died .
at least in the early years .
they should have a __quant1__ minute silence up at __name1__ .
after strategically ' excising ' bits of __name1__ in order to thwart people smugglers ( you can n't land in australia if we pass a law to say it is n't australia this week ) , our pint @-@ sized pm has decided to think big .
how big .
real big .
the govt is planning to create a ' security zone ' that extends __quant1__ nautical miles around the country .
this would allow the monitoring and possible interception of any vessel within the zone .
amazingly , other nearby nations ( __name1__ for one ) are a bit put out as it extends __name2__ soverienty well into sth __name3__ .
and why ?
the __name1__ has __quant1__ ....
there must be some sort of international bench @-@ mark for pissing off other nations in play here .
this govt has also repeatadly said that it will take independent action to pre @-@ emptively strike at ' terror ' and we are sourcing suppliers of cruise missiles .
now , it is pretty obvious that __name1__ won't be attacked from the east ( __name2__ ) , the south ( __name3__ ) or the west ( big ocean then __name4__ ) .
so , ' security zone ' is shorthand for , ' you sneaky little brown people better not try any funny business '.
of course they just happen to be the most populous __name1__ nation on earth - of course we should always walk tall and talk tough when dealing with them .
could you imagine how tough __name1__ would be if there was the ' islamic republic of canada ' with a billion or more people sitting on their northern border ?
you will never ever appease __name1__ .
they could n't give a stuff about __name1__ no matter what we say .
they would have invaded us long ago if there was n't a big stretch of ocean in between .
if i were to describe accurately and succinctly my estimation of that post , australia , i might be banned .
i shall content myself by simply saying that you are utterly ignorant of where stilly might have been , and what his experiences or feelings might be , nor do i see his whereabouts as forming the basis of any rational argument .
perhaps fortunately , however , you have made no attempt to formulate any such argument .
well was n't that progressive of them ...
this is the __value1__ time they 've done so .
the most amazing thing though is __name1__ , often described as the very heart of __name2__ liberalism , voted conservative on just about every one of the propositions out there .
they did approve assisted suicide , but i think voted against every other ' liberal ' proposal .
i honestly think the pendulum is beginning to swing back from the far left .
we can always hope .
once the traditional marriage is safe , then i am confident the people will get busy to provide a way for gay couples to enjoy the same protections as married people do , and i think that will pass with scarcely more than a murmor .
a new report on global warming , the product of a task force of academics , business leaders and politicians , chaired by former __name2__ administration transport minister __name1__ and __name4__ senator __name3__ , is deeply unsettling .
i love when those that do n't get it claim there can n't be global warming cause it 's __quant1__ degrees and theres __quant2__ feet of snow on the ground .
that 's actually __quant1__ of the things ( record / increased snowfall ) that indicates global warning is taking place .
what i do n't get is why some so vehemently deny global warming .
what is the benefit of denying that it is happening or accepting that it is possible ?
ya learn something new every day ....
ambergris is used in perfumes or as a perfume .
i thought it was a type of amber ( a tree resin product ) , but it is totally unrelated .
ambergris is basically , sperm whale trace .
you know how hawks and coyotes vomit up the undigestible parts of their food ?
so do sperm whales .
the stuff the eject is fould and gross , but after it floats in the sun , on the ocean , for many years , it becomes ambergris - worth a small fortune too .....
there was nothing the __century1__ th century whalers prized more highly -- a good haul of ambergris could allow all the ships officers to retire , or buy their own ships -- and allow the sailors to get famously drunk , until they were robbed and went lookin ' for a new berth ...
i found that quite interesting .
imagine breaking open a chunk of a ambergris and discovering something like that ...
" hey , kris , what the hell is this thing inside the ambergris ? "
" let me have a look .
i believe that is the hard beak of a giant squid ! "
that initial article said it was banned in the __name1__ under some endangered species thingie -- why , though ?
it seems like it 's pretty separated from any harm to the animal .
( if they kill one for it , if they get anything at all they 'll some foul @-@ smelling bile that has to be floated on the sea for __quant1__ years or more ... )
the ambergris itself is considered an endangered species , soz .
it is considered to be a floating ecosystem , sort of a microcosm of a rain forest , and every time one is destroyed scientists lose valuable information that might have been used for discovering a cure for cancer or some other dealdly malady .
__name1__ dramatically escalated the extrajudicial killings by __name2__ around the world ( mainly in __name3__ , __name4__ and __name5__ ) since taking office .
for example , in his __value1__ year in office __name1__ carried out more drone attacks in __name2__ than __name3__ 's entire presidency .
the next year ?
he more than doubled his own increased rate .
__name1__ is sending out these drones to kill people at a rate of once every __quant1__ days .
__name1__ 's average was about once every __quant1__ .
we 've made a new generation of enemies in __name2__ and __name1__ for these assassinations ( and the " night raids " __name3__ escalated in afghanistan ) .
other than __name1__ , nobody we are killing had anything to do with __name2__ @/@ __name2__ .
__quant1__ decade later many of the young men we are assassinating ( along with the civillians that constitute __quant1__ third of the number killed by these drones ) must have been kids when that happened .
do you think this is a good idea ?
if this was __name1__ would you be protesting it ?
voting against him ?
why can __name1__ , the greatest drone murderer in history , get away with it with hardly a word about it ?
he even gets away with cracking jokes about predator drones while i know damn well that most of you here would have excoriated __name1__ for something like that .
so why is it ?
do you all just not know that __name1__ has escalated the killings done in your name or do you just not care anymore ?
is war cool now ?
are these killing moral now ?
why are the lives __name1__ was killing more valuable than the ones that __name2__ is killing ?
why are you guys gonna vote for this warmonger ?
when you go on a crusade you do n't pull any punches with your headlines , do you , robert ?
that 's a bit over the top , don'cha think ?
i stated long ago that i no longer support him .
i will vote __value1__ party , if at all , since neither major party wants to nominate somebody with my values .
i see your point , which you made well on the other thread .
__quant1__ had a discussion __quant1__ week or so ago with a old lib friend thinking about voting for __name1__ , and i went on about my old theory about watching for the company someone keeps .
that 's from my hematology days , when if you find a blast cell in a peripheral smear , it was very likely a progenitor of the cells around it , thus helping identify the __name1__ .
( long ago , do n't know what they do on that now .)
thus , i might like a __name1__ , but would worry about the administration that came along with him or her .
i ended with saying i 'm not all so happy about the " company __name1__ keeps " either .
i convinced her , but my conviction on this is shallow .
she and i are both in despair about __name1__ for reasons already well discussed on a2k re his get along mode .
i 'm not sure she is as troubled by __name1__ actions around the world as i am , but i think so .
i 'm interested in __value1__ party mavericks , but have trouble envisioning how that would work out even if i approved of the candidate .
could __name1__ work out ?
huntsman as an independent ?
or , get elected in the __value1__ place ?
given a __name1__ in office , one of those in the present batch of candidates , i have more trouble not seeing things get worse in some ugly ways re the economy and how life would work for the struggling with little income .
i 've despaired with presidents before , though .
so , lets say a __name1__ is elected - i can imagine increasing polarization in the citizenry as an outcome .
it might result in real change - but in just what ways ?
you sound like you 'd rather see that than put up with __name1__ mediocrity any further .
on that , i both see your point and am not there yet myself .
why , i 'll say i fear things being worse ( to me ) for a while might spiral out of control .
here 's a funny one : when i got a job working for the local college i had to show my birth certificate before they would hire me .
mine had been mislaid and i 'd asked if there was any way i could work in lieu of finding it , but they said : no they would not hire me without a birth certificate .
but __name1__ has yet to produce a valid birth certificate and is no president of the __name2__ .
not only does it take less paperwork to become president of the __name1__ than a tutor at a local college , but the us constitution requires the president must be a natural born citizen !
without requiring proof of birth we have waived this constitutional requirement .
@muarck , note : this is not __name1__ or __name1__ agenda .
i 'm a democrat who voted __name1__ .
this is just about gross violations of the __name1__ constitution .
who are you trying to fool ?
__name1__ produced a valid birth certificate .
it was verified by the state of __name1__ .
it 's been upheld in numerous court proceedings .
it 's been investigated by just about every news organization out there .
but you do n't have an agenda , yeah right .
a certified copy of a birth certificate issued by the state of birth is valid legal proof of birth , acceptable in a court of law .
no one gets their original certificate of birth .
those always stay on file in wherever the state keeps their vital records .
__name1__ has shown a certified copy .
it 's been examined several times and declared valid .
the state of __name1__ has verified the original .
give it up . he 's legal
according to the __name1__ .... here 's a local link
i 've been wondering when that 'd be called !
__name1__ has both __name2__ and __name3__ at " __value1__ % reporting " but they 're still not colored in .
i am shocked that this happened .
i am not unhappy but i am shocked .
the tension and animosity on the street in __name1__ is palpable .
i 've been threatened physically twice .... like i give a shit ....
i do tend to stir the pot i realize .
last night at my gig some drunks late night were discussing what to call __name1__ ... bandying the usual right wing talk around and i said " i suggest you call him the motherfucking president elect ".
he was n't sure what to say in response to that so he paid his tab and left
after last night 's events in __name4__ , it 's clear that the __name1__ does n't want to be a part of the __name2__ ( or just the __name3__ ? ) anymore .
the continent can cope without the __name1__ .
but can the __name1__ go to a prosperous future without the euro , without the continent ?
what alliances are now possible ? just the __name1__ , or the a re @-@ organised __name2__ ?
where will be the future place of this country among __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , the __name4__ ?
the __name1__ has said " bye , bye __name2__ ".
i hope they know the meaning of " auf wiedersehen "!
@walter hinteler , i can n't remember where i read the analysis , but the conclusion which made sense to me was that currency boundaries ultimately implied federal boundaries .
to be anthropomorphic , the " __name1__ psyche " resists federal union with __name2__ as evidenced by their original reluctance to join the __name3__ .
this latest decision is symptomatic of that resistance but economic events will ultimately decide whether " resistance is futile ".
it 's also a sovereignty issue -- and sovereignty is something which the __name1__ has never effectively addressed .
ever crucial issue is put up for a plebecite , or a vote by nation -- and the population of one or more countries , or the governments of one of more countries , torpedo the deal .
as a " union , " it 's farcical .
not too long ago , when __name1__ campaigned for the presidency , he was all about human rights .
and man did he chastise the __name1__ ' approach to them .
time and time again , __name1__ emphasized ( and i 'm quoting from memory here ) that under his rule __name2__ would n't lead the world through the example of its power , but through the power of its example .
__value1__ of his __value1__ acts as president was to announce the shutdown of the prison camp at __name1__ , which had come to symbolize the __name2__ administration 's fast , loose , and secretive approach to human rights .
last week , the __name1__ administration had a perfect opportunity to act on its rhetoric , to set an example of __name2__ 's new spirit , to specifically deliver “ change we can believe in ”.
to understand this opportunity , you have to remember that __name1__ was just the tip of the iceberg .
the rest of the iceberg , hidden underneath the waterline from public scrutiny and media symbolism , exists a system of __name1__ prisons in foreign countries .
when the __name1__ suspects people of connections to terrorism , it snatches them off the streets wherever they live , flies them to those secret prisons , and interrogates them .
credible reports allege that the __name1__ uses torture to extract information from them .
( i 've written about __quant1__ of the victims a little over __quant2__ years ago ) .
when some of the victims are trying to pursue their cases in federal court , the __name1__ administration tried to throw out their cases on a theory about government secrets .
__name1__ , consistent with the rest of his human rights rhetoric , sharply criticized __name2__ for it .
but now that __name2__ 's secrecy theory is before an appeals court , __name1__ is changing his mind .
without qualifications , he is now sticking to the __name1__ position that torture victims cannot sue the __name2__ , because the torture is a state secret .
“ change we can believe in ”?
yeah right .
that is so __quant1__ year ago !
it 's what most politicians would do ... but still...sigh .
the hell of it is to whom do we turn .
the __name1__ and __name2__ policies that have put us in this position ?
we all voted for __name1__ because of these policies but where do we turn to really gain a government of the people for all the people .
__name2__ , __name2__ , all i see are crooked politicians who are only interested in thier own gain and screw the rest of us .
well it was n't just campaign promises , he repeated it in his inauguration , when he already had the presidency in hand .
" we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals ."
apparently he was missing some qualifiers , so i 'll fix it for him :
" we sometimes reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals when it is politically convenient ."
yeah , i just saw this for the __value1__ time too .
does n't look good , but i do n't know anything beyond what 's here .
thomas -- when 's the last time you saw me say anything about __name1__ , yay or boo ?
i 'm still in politics detox mode and still just not following this stuff .
also just plain not on __name1__ much .
this happened to be recently replied to when i checked in just now .
__quant1__ wonder which couple of years he is referring to .
the power of propaganda .
even half @-@ ways intelligent people just automatically repeat this propaganda that 's been driven into their heads .
interesting use of subject @/@ object pronouns .
__quant1__ have been busy the last few days .
today is the __value1__ heard about the story on __name1__ .
i admit i do n't know the facts but on it 's face i disagree with the decision .
it 's __quant1__ days old ?
it certainly had n't made it into my paper unless i skimmed over it .
gushing like teenagers about their __value1__ crush ? i do n't gush thomas .
this is n't really an endorsement of torture and rendition , is it ?
with nothing to go on except the link to the __name3__ article , it looks more like there is n't going to be legal action against __name1__ and the unnamed __name2__ subsidiary for activities they were assured were legal at the time .
i never felt obliged to report every screwup made by the previous administration .
there were so many better qualified people to handle that .
i 'm very close to breaking point ,
i 've loved the same girl for about __quant1__ years .
__quant1__ 've kept it to myself forever , then told a friend a few months ago cause __quant1__ just could n't cope anymore .
then a week 1 @/@ 2 ago , i declared my love for the girl in a text when i was drunk .
she eventually replied a couple of days later being unbelievably kind about it , which has really just made me fall even deeper ( if this is possible ) .
i told her she would n't hear from me for a while , you know , so i can attempt to move on .
so now i 'm at the start of the move on phase , but i 'm just stuck .
i cut off most of my hair and i 've started exercising and changing my diet to try to alter the chemicals in my body to make me feel better that way , but does n't seem to be working , i 'm still miserable .
a song about love will come on my itunes ( pretty much every song in the world ) or a song that reminds me of her , and i 'll just break down .
i feel like just dropping out of uni and getting on a flight to __name1__ and never coming back .
during a really low point last week i cut myself ( which i had n't done in __quant1__ ) just because __quant1__ had so much pent @-@ up emotion , __quant1__ had to let it out somehow .
i really do n't know what to do or how to help myself be happy again .
people say time is a healer but i do n't know if i 'll be able to hold out that long !
find activities to occupy your time .
there has to be something you really enjoy doing ?
set some goals for yourself . i.e.:
- go to the gym 5 times __quant1__ week for __quant2__ hour a day .
- read x books in __quant1__ month .
- platinum all the __name1__ games .
- meet __quant2__ new person __quant2__ day and engage in a meaningful conversation .
- learn a new skill ( could be playing an instrument , drawing , trying a new sport , web design , etc.) .
just some examples .
find an activity you like , set some goals , stick to them .
the key is to occupy yourself and meet new people .
maybe make a new playlist on itunes for starters , with happy music . ' __name1__ ' by __name2__ , etc.
things that do n't make you think of her .
try , like /\ /\ suggested , getting a hobby , going to the gym etc.
it won't be easy , but it 's just one of these things in life .
try counting all the things that you do have in life ,
sure you might not have her , but i 'm sure you have a number of other things .
you 're in uni arn't you ? ?
well , a large percentage of the population do n't have that , and i 'm sure you can finish the list .
it might seem impossible at the moment , but pick yourself up and live life with as much energy as you can .
talking to people on here is always a place to start , have made some wonderful friends on here
turn to religion .
when i was in your exact same position i turned to religion and __name1__ has worked very well boosting up my self @-@ content .
i really like this girl and she 's in a few of my classes at university .
everytime i look at her i find her looking banck at me .
regardless i do n't know her that well but i fancy her a lot .
i was going to ask her out but for the past few weeks __quant1__ 've been waiting for the right time ( which never comes , partly coz __quant1__ 'm scared ) .
but being valentines __name1__ , should i ask her out and give her a card , or would that be cheesy .
maybe i should just wait for valentines to go .
i see her tomorrow and i could approach her .
i sometimes worry what her mates will think of me , i do n't know i 'm nervous but it has to be done so i can move on i guess
forget about the friends ; if she 's a nice girl , go for it !
be casual , as you run the risk of coming on too strong if you do anything seriously __name1__ @-@ y .
i would suggest waiting until thursday or so ( let the __name1__ @-@ __name1__ aura float by a bit ) , and then ask her if she 's got plans sunday afternoon for coffee .
low pressure , maximum talking time .
good luck !
well , in my estimation , while it is " romantic " to ask on __name1__ , it __name1__ also high @-@ pressure .
it 's your decision , obviously .
either way , coffee date ( or something similar .)
and do ask !
ask as soon as you can manage to get it off your chest .
asked my girlfriend what fantasies she wants to indulge in , turns out she wants to have a threesome with a lesbian @/@ bi friend of hers that 's wanted to **** her for ages .
and yes the __value1__ party is fit and has let my gf touch her before .
my girlfriend is straight but she gets a kick out of pleasuring people , if that makes sense .
i 'm really kind of split on the issue tbh , i do n't have much experience with this sort of thing , if i was in a no @-@ strings relationship they would be no stopping me , but i can n't help feeling that going through with it would spoil things between us .
but then again we 're young and it is something i 'd like to kick off the bucket list , as it were .
anyone have any experiences with this before ?
good or bad ?
what should i look out for/ be careful of , really do n't want to ruin things with my girlfriend , but the idea of a threesome is thrilling , not gunna lie .
not really , threesomes in relationships can really cause issues ,
not to mention the reality is oft very different from the fantasy .
im sexually open minded but theres no way id share my gf with a boy or girl .
if im single yeah sure , attached no way .
if my gf suggested it id tell her no , straight out .
sorry but i dont share .
oh and ive had threesomes before someone says it - both mmf and ffm
if you are n't planning on being with this girl forever then go for it .
if you 're engaged or some **** then best not to .
if her friend has wanted to ' f**k her for ages ' i doubt it will end well
apparentley threesomes can really ruin relationships , as they can make people insecure and unconfident .
fantasy is sometimes better than reality .
if you have any insecurities at all , then i would recommend you not do it .
like people have said , in theory , it 's great .
in reality , things are a lot more complicated .
i 've been with my girlfriend for well over __quant1__ year now , and __quant1__ 'm quite selfless towards her .
i do everything i can to make her life easier and better , and we both love each other .
it means that i spend generously if needed and put a lot of time and effort into the relationship .
however , the other night , i brought up " the future ".
as in , thinking about where we 'd be a couple years from now and how serious she was about staying with me .
turns out , that she did n't really like me that much when we started dating and she was just seeing how things went ( although now she says she is very happy , but surprised , that she has stayed with me this long ) .
i asked her what she thought about where we 'd be and she said she does n't want to think about that , and that i should be happy about the experiences we 've had ( which i am ) .
my issue is that , should i continue putting so much effort into her if it just seems like i 'm " what 's good right now " for her , although it seems as if she does n't want to make any plans or even hope to stay together for a long time .
it just seems unfair that i 'm putting in a lot more effort into this relationship and that if we did break up , she 'd have gained a lot more than i did as a result .
any thoughts ?
in your situation i would say enjoy the moment you 're in now .
currently i 'm on the fence in regards to getting more serious with a guy who is technically still married , has __quant1__ children and has openly told me does not want to get married again or have any more kids .
if you ever find yourself in a situation like this thinking about the future early on is a must in my opinion because there is a lot more at stake .
my boyfriend has one of those jobs where he 's on call a lot .
this year he 's on call for our anniversary .
this happens a lot .
he said we 'll not make reservations but we will make plans etc but not to bank on it .
i 'm not angry at him @- i 'm in uni and i know how it is for things to change suddenly .
but i need to find a way to cope with this .
if i get all dressed up and sit waiting , he often texts me saying he has to cancel .
the disappointment is horrible .
if i do n't get ready , he comes home and i 'm in my pjyamas , not showered or ready in anyway .
it ruins the night because i have to run around and get ready and i do n't get to do any of the things i wanted to .
is there anyway to
bless you i know where you 're coming from .
my boyfriend is a bobby so he often has to stay late because of a job , he 's been hours and hours before getting back .
it makes it harder because we 're in an ldr so we have little time together anyway and with me at uni and him with only two days off __quant1__ week now in comparision to the __quant2__ @/@ __quant3__ it 's hard .
i do n't think you can not get disappointed .
the job demands it .
i realise that and sounds like you do too but it does n't make it any easier .
it 's just something we have to deal with .
value the moments you do get to spend together , try not to plan things in advance if things are likely to cancel but be prepared for a bit of spontaneity , maybe have an outfit already in your head you could wear at last minute ?
it 's frustrating , you 're not alone in feeling the way you do .
__quant1__ 'm studying abroad for __quant1__ year and my boyfriend is going to come visit me a few times times .
should __quant1__ pay for some/half/any of his plane ticket ?
i feel bad when __quant1__ have all this spare loan money and he 's having to save up for weeks to come see me , which is something we both want .
what do i do ?
i 'd discuss it with him -
i did n't do abroad , but when my ex and i were apart he 'd pay for his tickets and i 'd pay for everything whilst he was staying at mine -@ food , transport etc ( when he let me anyway ) .
so really it depends on how much the tickets are costing .
i guess as he 's having to save up that living costs wont cover it .
i 'd suggest either half , or if it makes him feel less bad about it , alternate - so he pays for the __value1__ trip , you pay for the __value2__ etc.
when i lived abroad my boyfriend at the time would pay for his flights
( they were n't much luckily ) and i would pay for most of the stuff when he was there ; eating out ... etc .
so my life 's been quiet now for a pretty long length of time ...
i'v had the occasions of seeing guys , but it never ends good or lasts long .
since __month1__ last year i havn't been in a proper relationship and life 's getting a bit too quiet for my liking .
i can n't seem to meet any new genuine guys .
their all ' manwhores ' to put it bluntly .
some that i meet , i 'll be physically attracted to them..but they have no personality to them..you could say their like male barbie dolls .
however , some i will meet who have such a lovely personality , but i wont be attracted to them physically .
i can n't seem to find someone with that ' connection ' if you know what i 'm saying .
im starting to feel like it 's me who is the problem .
i can n't seem to find anyone who is n't just interested in sex ...
advice please ! ?
use your gold digger ability and find a rich man .
meh i have the same problem just in reverse .
it does get a bit demoralising sometimes when everyone around you is in a relationship , especially now which is probably the worst time of year to be single .
i would n't blame yourself though , you probably just have n't had an opportunity come along .
i 've met plenty of nice girls at uni but it takes a lot for me to actually develop feelings for someone , and i can n't say i 've met anyone who i genuinely have feelings for .
i 'd rather wait until i do then find a girlfriend for the sake of it - try and think of things that way ?
just have to keep putting yourself out there i guess , if you 're constantly meeting new people or getting better acquainted with people you already know , an opportunity will come up eventually .
theres a fair chance you 've caught someones eye already and they 're keeping quiet about it
so me and my ex broke up about 2 and a half months ago .
do n't know how it all happened but she said she 'd like to see me during the __name1__ holidays .
now i had this weird thing going on with this breakup.. for the __value1__ __quant1__ weeks i felt totally heartbroken , then i was getting on good for a while , then went back to being really sad , etc.
before i came back i felt like i was over it ; then i came back , and suddenly , yet again feel unhappy .
it 's really goddamn annoying .
either way , from what i 've heard , she is n't really the same kind of person she was when we were together ( in a good way for me ; apparently like the kind of girl i 'm not interested in ) , so meeting with her might totally kill whatever residual feelings there are and i can get on with my life .
or it won't work and i 'll spiral back into sadness .
or we may get back together , since she told me she might feel differently in the future . ( ie , want me back , after a break that 's less ' stressful '; not that we ever had a stressful time.. ) .
i do n't think this is ideal , but i 'm an idiot . i know i still feel kind of possessive over her..
i hate the thought of her with another guy .
so should i meet with her ? or not ? or delete her out of my life entirely ? or what..
depending on what you want .
if you want her back , do it .
if you want to be over her , do n't go .
i would say __value1__ % chance that will end up feeling even more sad than you are if you go see her , coz feeling do n't just die in __quant1__ months ( unless there was nothing at the start ) .
i met up with my ex after __quant1__ years of no contact at all and still feelings came back .
so yeah , do n't fool yourself . whatever that girl is doing now is probably just a pretend , trying to move on , be a changed person , ect ect .
do n't expect to feel nothing when you see her .
ok its very important to know this quote : " once a girl leaves her boyfriend , the only reason she might wanna be back is to hurt her bf "
dude , do n't meet up with her even if you love her to death because once you have broken up , there is no way back and all this meeting will do to you is to make you feel upset afterwards .
i was in the similar situation couple of momth ago and __quant1__ just kept this girl away from me and you ought to do the same since __quant1__ something is over , then it is over
i really need advice .
me and my boyfriend started dating when we were __quant1__ , and we 're now at uni still going out .
he 's always been the sweetest guy , __quant1__ mean really nice and funny but these past few months things have changed .
he 's had problems at home lately , and things have been really tough for him .
im surprised how well he dealt with it all .
but recently i 've learnt not to bring it up in conversation or he 'll get really angry about it .
i do n't want to go into details but lately he 's been getting agry at the slightest things , and if i can n't calm him down he 'll get violent especially after a drink .
he 'll always laugh it off afterwards as if he didnt mean it , and i know he doesnt because he is a good guy .
i 've tried talking to him about it several times , telling him i 'll leave him if he does it again but it hasnt stopped , and he has such a hold on me i dont think i could never leave him .
im so emotionally drained and dont want any friends to know because they 'll just think bad of him , when really he is good deep down .
sorry for the rambling , i just needed to get that out .
i 'm posting anonymously because what i am going to say is very personal .
just over __quant1__ years ago my girlfriends step @-@ father was hurting her mum .
my girlfriend went to help her mum and in turn was hit over the head by a glass bottle . as you might expect the police were called and the prick was arrested .
he appeared in court the next day and plead not @-@ guilty to assaulting her mum and assaulting her to her injury ( serious assault in __name1__ ) .
now this is where my story gets really sick .
i type this and i am full of rage .
my girlfriends mum writes to the court and asks for her husbands bail conditions to be dropped as well as for the charges to be dropped .
she tells the court not to write to her at her own address or phone her home - this stopped my girlfriend from finding out what her mum was up to .
in __name1__ , domestic abuse charges are not dropped if a victim requests for them to be dropped .
though the bail conditions were dropped by the __name1__ in __name2__ - this allowed the cowardly little prick to contact my girlfriend , her mum and enter the family home .
we found this out on __month1__ __day1__ rd __year1__ at about 7.30pm when her mum phoned her to say her husband was back in the house and wanted to talk about what happened .
we phoned the police because as far as we were aware bail conditions were still in place .
there was nothing they could do .
her mum kicked her out on __name1__ __year1__ to allow the prick to stay .
i was raging .
seeing my girlfriend in tears at __quant1__ years old was absolutely heart @-@ breaking for me .
i did not know how to help but all i did was worry and worry .
my behaviour started to change , i had recently started a career in the __name1__ but due to stress i started to develop problems .
i was eventually referred to a psychologist by my gp to deal with anxiety .
when the case went to trial , her mother lied and said my girlfriend attacked him .
the **** was found not @-@ guilty .
my girlfriend was heart broken .
i lost it , i went absolutely crazy .
if my mum had not calmed me down then i would be in prison just now .
__quant1__ years on and my girlfriend has forgiven her mum .
they live in a flat and the mum disappears at the weekend - __quant1__ points if you can guess who she goes to see .
i have not forgiven her mum .
i do not visit the flat when her mum is in .
i have had arguments with her mum where i have said some absolutely vile things which i am not in the least bit proud about .
i have asked my girlfriend to stay with her dad as i still worry .
basically me not liking her mum affects our relationship a little bit - if we were ever to take the next step and eventually get married then i do not know how we would do it , though my girlfriend assures me that we would manage somehow .
i still think about the incident a lot .
what i am trying to say is that domestic abuse does not just affect you - it will affect everyone you care about .
please take what i have said to heart and leave this guy .
been with a guy for over __quant1__ years .
he 's been acting really weird recently .
he has n't picked up literally __quant1__ @/@ __quant2__ of my calls .
has n't returned any texts either .
i did get to speak to him the last time __quant3__ rung him ( after him blanking __quant1__ @/@ __quant2__ calls ) and i asked him what 's up but he did n't tell me ( this was over __quant3__ month ago ) .
the fact that its a long distance relationship does n't make it any better .
he did this before once __quant1__ years ago as well over nothing but i can n't really remember how it proceeded ... i guess he just gradually starting calling again .
apart from this , we have had a very loving and almost perfect relationship .
i 'm starting to lose trust in him now .
i do n't know if i 'm overreacting , but i just feel really hurt about the way he 's neglecting me again and i 'm literally crying as i write this .
i let him get away with it last time but i 've had enough .
i do n't know what i aim to achieve writing this on a student forum , but any ideas on what should i do ? is it worth ending the relationship ?
i do n't wanna ring him any more because i feel insulted that he just casually blanks my calls .
and asking him does n't help either since he 's not gunna tell me .
hmm ... good few issues here .
personally , i do n't think long @-@ distant relationships would be successful .
the playing hard to get , in reflection to what others have said , is clearly not to way to go , since you 're already living far from each other already .
i think that there 's a range of possibilities as to why he 's acting this way :
1 ) he 's got something to hide .
if you 're saying he acted this way before about __quant1__ years ago and then perfectly fine later on , there 's clearly something going on in his mind .
i do n't know if that 's cheating or if there 's something else , but there 's clearly something he 's not sharing with you
2 ) he 's fed up with the relationship .
3 ) he 's autonomous and needs a lot of space .
i 'm exactly the same .
even if it 's a long distant relationship , sometimes receiving phonecalls ( depending on how often you 'd call him ) could actually affect his perception on how he feels about the relationship .
i think if you were to give him a ' taste of his own medicine ' then effectively you might receive the response you 're expecting but i think what 's missing here most is communication .
when you see him next time , do n't criticise or start questioning him .
just express your worries to him and maybe you 'll get something out of him .
edit : i do n't understand the neg .
ok so i am female and like males , always have , obsessed with a few male celebs and see myself wth guys .
however occassionally i seem to have feelings for older females but i 'm not sure if they are like sexual feelings and it 's quite confusing .
for the __value1__ time there is a female who i like whos quite a bit older and i definitely have feelings .
i know that she is n't straight .
i deliberately try to talk to her and spend time with her even though shes clearly quite a bit older .
perhaps they are more feelings because i look up to the person ?
i 'm really not sure , does anyone have any ideas ?
what does this mean ?
it seems strange when i am physically attracted to men ?
if you 're physically attracted to men and you 're not sexually aroused by her , i 'd say you have your answer there it might be that you get nervous and your heart beats faster because you are anxious to please her , or her opinion of you matters to you ?
if you scour the forums and do a search , you 'll see that you 're not the only one who has ever felt like this about a teacher of the same gender .
i used to - in fact , still ! - attach to female teachers and tutors a lot .
my counsellor had great fun dissecting it and telling me how i 'm sexually attracted to mother figures , but he was just an arse
i was n't in a relationship with this guy but we 've been seeing each other .
in __value1__ year we were always together in the same group of friends..
it was fine .
now in __value1__ year , he 's decided he does n't want to see me anymore .
he wants to be ' friends '.
but i know he does n't really want to be friends at all .
i think he 's got someone else.. and that 's why he 's finished it but i do n't really care that he 's finished it .
what i do care about is that i 've been completely cut out .
he lives in the same place as me and has n't spoken to me __quant1__ since .
i 've been cut out of nights out , get togethers.. etc all because i 'm not seeing him anymore .
this really upsets me , i want to be friends with him and i 'm willing to be but he seems to have cut me out so now i 'm not seeing other people either
really hate it .
what can i do/say ?
other people have cut me out because i 'm not with him anymore either !
this is what you do :
in future you make your own friends , not someone elses .
this is what you say :
oh well , life 's not over .
my ex cut me out as soon as he got a new gf even though he promised to be friends , and that was __quant1__ months ago
so my best piece of advice is try to move on
its bloody hurtful and hard
at first i spent the __value1__ __quant1__ weeks cryingmy eyes out not sleeping , then it ended up that i felt i had done something wrong and therefore he dumped me
he let me blame myself and for weeks __quant1__ kept thinking what if __quant1__ had said this or done that , and then i found out him and his new gf were togther behind my back and i was nothing to do with it , .
so i think if you have like __quant1__ other friend go out with them , maybe get a job or hobby and meet new people show him you dont care these boys love to think we are sitting at home waiting for their text which we might be but they cant know that
i have never done something like this before , but i have nobody to ask/ talk to for advice as i cant tell anybody i know
my ex boyfriend had been with me for about __quant1__ months when he went to uni he cheated on me and dumped me .
he is now in a official relationship with the girl he cheated on me with , becuase of this we have no spoken since he dumped me __quant1__ months ago
it was a very very very bad break up
however when we did break up i was a bit of a idiot and begged him not to leave me becuase i was in love with him ,
however ive been feeling ill for a few weeks and went __quant1__ went to the doctor she said im potentially pregnant .
im freaking out
yes i need to do a test but i dont know when as i cant let anybody find out ,
also i feel i cant tell nmy ex as he thinks everything i do is for his attention to gain him back ,
if i tell him i might be pregnant he willl assume im lying to break up him and his new gf which im not but i dont know what to do
im scared and i dont know how i can tell hiim without him accusing me of being a liar .
she said you 're " potentially pregnant "?
what kind of a doctor would say that without giving you a test ?
do a test and get it all over and done with
how about you do a test first and then think of the how to approach it ?
... take it from one who knows , no doctor is going to tell you that you might be pregnant , and then send you home to deal with it .
i do n't understand why you have n't done a pregnancy test .
they only cost about £3 or so .
get on and do it and then sort yourself out .
go straight to the doctor .
like get up and go now .
they 'll give you another test just to make sure ( however pregnancy tests are rarely wrong when they read positive ) .
they will discuss your options with you and probably direct you towards some people who can give you counselling if you ask .
your options are obviously : termination , continue with pregnancy and have the child adopted , continue with pregnancy and keep the child .
first off , it 's best that i explain that i 've barely any experience with girls .
i 'm in my __value1__ year of uni and i , um , ' opened my account ' in the sexual world the other night with a girl at my student union .
we 've met a few times before and have quite a few mutual friends , so she was n't a complete stranger .
went back to hers for the night ( she chose that location because she had lectures the following morning ) and thought i handled the actual sex relatively well ...
the problem i have lies in the aftermath .
i can be pretty insecure at times ( it 's a wonder i actually made it back to hers , because i was worried i was imposing too much ) , and when i woke up i panicked and said i had to go and get some work done ( which i genuinely did , although thinking back on it , it was a weak reason to leave ) .
she decided not to go in for her lecture ( which i eventually realised was probably a hint for me to stay for a bit ) and we had a pretty friendly chat whilst i collected my phone , keys etc. together .
she even asked if i wanted her to come back to mine , but i refused and said something stupid like ' nah it 's okay , have a lie in ', which i 've been kicking myself for .
i just got myself into a panic and had a mental block .
so __quant1__ left , and sent her a light @-@ hearted text a couple of hours later apologising for leaving so hastily and hoping that she had a good night ... and did n't get a response .
from here , i do n't know where to go .
to her , i probably came off as someone who does this all the time , and she was just __quant2__ girl on a list of dozens i 've had __quant1__ night stands with .
i just felt like i was a bit clinical and almost rude , especially with her asking if i wanted her to come back with me .
all i want to do now is somehow show her that i 'm not an absolute prick , without seeming too desperate or clingy .
i realise the error of my ways , and have beaten myself up over it massively ever since i left hers ...
i do n't think it 's a completely irretrievable situation , because she 's genuinely a lovely girl , and i reckon i can convince her i 'm not the womanising idiot she ( probably ) thinks i am ... but my lack of experience with girls leaves me with no idea what to do .
help , please ! ?!?
i see what you mean .
i 'd suggest giving her another text asking perhaps to meet up - cinema , dvd , or grab a coffee @/@ lunch before lectures or something .
if she ignores this too then just move on to the next
then again , she mightn't want anything serious , so just go slow .
just text her and invite her to go out .
to clarify are you just looking to ' have fun ' with the girl , or are you cool with the idea of going a little serious ?
i get the impression she likes you and is maybe looking for something a little bit serious than occasional banging..
i 'm not really sure , to be honest .
i kinda wanna take it __quant1__ step at a time .
asking her out for a cuppa could be a good idea , although i do n't want to do that just as a way of saying sorry .
i 'd rather clear the air first and show her that i know i made a mistake before getting into anything else with her .
you complete bloody numpty
you have learnt a valuable lesson
i 'm scared as to how he might react and it 's been __quant1__ weeks and i 've still not found the perfect moment to tell him .
also i 'm afraid what if he does n't want to keep it when i really do .
although he 's a couple of year older than me ( __quant1__ ) , he can act really immature , aggressive , and violent at time .
my parents have come to terms with it now after having little mini heart attacks , it 's just how can i break it to him ?
i think you should break it to him gentally .
make sure your having a proper convo like one on one and eye contact , then break it to him .
remember it will be a shock to him but hopefully in the end he will pull though and surport you .
i do n't think there is a way to tell him other than just being straight to the point .
regardless of his reaction or personal feelings about pregnancy or abortion , he has a right to know .
talk to him about what you want to do and what he would like to happen .
if you agree , great . if you can n't then talking to your parents might be the next best thing .
well he asked you to get the morning after pill , did you say you would ?
if you agreed to take the morning after pill but did n't then that 's quite unfair and he will be annoyed .
it 's obvious he did n't want a baby because he was using contraception and even though it failed he did say he wanted you to take the morning after pill , so do n't be surprised if he does a runner .
you just have to be honest with him and hopefully he will take care of his responsibilities .
you said your mum knows ?
well break the news with her by your side then , hopefully your boyfriend won't get violent or anything .
give him time to digest the information .
it will come as a shock , particularly if you thought you 'd played it safe .
i know you said you did n't think you could have an abortion , but it 's important to talk things through with him and decide what 's best to do for both of you and , most importantly , for the baby .
yeah i 'll tell you guys tomorrow i 'm just afraid as he 's prone to act violent at times .
+ he told me to take the pill and i did n't and he 's gonna be like ' wtf there 's no way i can support a child at __quant1__ and that you should n't be having a kid as you 're not even __quant2__ yet blah blah blah '...
so i 'll just tell him he does n't have to be involved with our child financially and i just want him to be there for it as a fatherly figure ( which i doubt he can commit to ) as my parents can support us anyways .
this is going to sound harsh and i understand it is your body , but i am going to be brutally honest .
get an abortion .
firstly , you may want to keep it , but think about it in the long run .
what kind of life will the baby live ?
you are still a kid yourself , around 16 @/@ 17 i would assume .
i doubt you will be able to give it a good life .
also your boyfriend .
i doubt he will be happy and most of the time , boys in this situation will bail .
he is __quant1__ , i doubt he has any long term plans to stay with you .
by keeping the baby you are pretty much being selfish .
yeah its your body , but there are __quant1__ people you need to think about :
1 . the baby . i can almost guarantee you will not be able to give the baby a good life because of how young you are , and i doubt the father will stay .
2 . your boyfreind . he is __quant1__ , you are dragging him down for life at such a young age by keeping it .
actually __quant1__ people .
yourself . you may end up regretting it in the long run .
having a baby is a huge responsibility .
this is children having children .
do everyone a favor and have an abortion .
harsh but true .
you will just end up adding to the long and miserable statistic .
edit : cant believe i was actually negged for this . truth ****ing hurts .
i 'm confused , i love him or i thought i did so why am i turned off him now ?
he admitted to me that he is bisexual we were talking about ex 's and he told me about one ex who is another guy .
i was shocked and asked him why he did n't tell me before , he said he did n't see a reason to tell me because he liked me a lot .
he should have told me , i 'm turned off at the thought of him with other guys and being sexually attracted to another guy .
will this feeling go away or shall i break up ?
do n't feel guilty for feeling like that .
nothing wrong with being bi , but just as bi 's have a taste for guys and girls , some people do n't have a taste for bi 's , if you know what i mean ?
if you 're really into him stick around , maybe it 's just the shock that 's making you feel this way .
maybe wait a few days and see how the news settles with you before making a decision ?
everyone has a past , to judge him on his would be unfair if you love him .
but if it turns you off or you can n't come to terms with it then its probably best to break it off .
either way , give yourself a few days to think about it __quant1__ if you 're not sure .
i 've suffered with excess body hair since i was young , and i was bullied because of it through primary @/@ secondary school and now am unable to wear tshirts etc in public because of how paranoid i am about it .
i went to the doctors because of it when i was around __quant1__ , and they did a blood test but it came back normal so i assume i do n't have __name1__ .
i have very hairy arms for a girl , not thick hairs like a males but lots of very noticable , dark and long ( __quant1__ bleach regularly but it only lasts __quant1__ day or __quant2__ before the roots are noticable ) .
i have never shaved them because i shave my legs and get terrible ingrown hairs , even though i moisturise @/@ exfoliate etc.
i 've tried waxing but it only lasted __quant1__ days before the hairs began to grow back , so it 's really not worth it .
anyway i checked out reviews and after shopping around i decided to get the £350 boots smooth skin plus intense pulsed light permanent hair reduction machine .
the reviews were on the whole very good , it comes with __quant1__ flashes ( it takes between 70 @-@ 100 flashes to do my arms each time i think ) and you need applicator gel which is £3 .
it appears to do exactly the same thing as you would get in a laser clinic , but cheaper and means i will be able to target any missed hairs you might get going to a clinic and it 's obviously private/convenient .
the sales assistant in __name1__ was very helpful , and assured me i could get a no @-@ quibble refund if i find it does n't work but she assured me it will .
i 'm going to use it on my arms first of all , because this is the area that affects me the most confidence wise , but will gradually move on to other areas .
for permanent hair reduction __quant1__ will need to use the machine __quant1__ week for between __quant2__ @-@ __quant3__ weeks ( although __quant1__ will probably need 12 weeks ! ) and will start using it tonight .
i 'm quite sceptical over whether it will work but because i 'm confident i can return it , i think it was worth the risk .
i know other girls on here have the same issue with excess body hair , so will monitor the hair reduction over the __quant1__ weeks course to let you know how it goes incase anyone else is thinking of buying one
week __value1__ : shaved my arms and zapped them today , did it in __quant1__ separate goes ( took around __quant2__ mins to do each arm ) and my sister did them for me just because certain angles are tricky to get to .
on a pain scale i 'd give it 2 @/@ 10 ( just feels like a hot , tingling sensation for about __quant1__ second then fades ) .
will update what the regrowth is like next saturday .
week __value1__ : had to shave my arms again last night all over , hair regrowth not as course or fast as expected but still widespread .
just finished zapping them again but this time did it myself , found it to be much quicker .
i was thinking of buying one of these because i just think it would be the best thing ever to never have to shave my bikini area again !
let us know how you get on !
if this works well i would definitely buy one , i hate shaving and my arms are quite hairy as well ( i do n't shave or bleach them but i am self conscious ) , so i 'd love to be hair free forever .
please let us know how you get on
thanks for doing this , op.
i 've been debating whether to get one of these machines too .
i really hope it works for you .
i hope it works too !
i suffer from excess body hair and would love for a machine that could get rid of it !
is there any way you can use this kind of thing on your face ?
i assume goggles would be necessary but it would be really nice if it were possible .
i have been looking both at this and the phillips lumea , which is a little more expensive , but i keep thinking it 's too much of an expense for something that i 'm not __value1__ % sure will work .
looking forward to hearing what your results are like for this , as i 'd love to be able to buy something that would mean i would n't have to shave every __quant1__ days in the summer !
without any cosmetic enhancements .
tips ? hints ?
in an ideal world i 'd like to hit a 8 @/@ 10 .
i ask this because i want to start ' mingling '.
i 'd like to look like ' something special ' for once .
styling your hair and cloth helps a lot .
a bit of make @-@ up , almost every girl wears make @-@ up .
some nice accessories would help too .
dye your hair a ridic colour .
wear really weird earrings .
wear clashing colours !
bright red ( or orange , or any colour , if you 're confident enough ) lippy .
im really pale and sick of using fake tan ... coming out patchy and smelling like curry is awful !
i have loads of freckles over my body so it doesnt even look nice natural !
i wanted to start using sunbeds ... not to often but just to build a nice natural tan !
but when i go on holiday i burn really easily so i was wondering whether i would burn if i went on the sunbeds or if i built it up it would be gradually get my skin to go tanned ?
do n't use sunbeds .
pale freckly skin is lovely , and sunbeds are really dangerous and just not good for you .
sunbeds are very dangerous , especially with regular use and for people with naturally pale complexions , and you say you have ' freckles ' all over your body .
some of these may be moles and so it 's just not safe .
invest in a proffessional fake spray tan - there are more and more salons .
or just be pale and beautiful as i am
i am so confused and annoyed !
my mac nc55 studio fix fluid was perfect for my face a couple of months ago but now my face looks dull and...muddy/ashy ?
also my face and chest had a ridiculous colour difference .
i googled nc45 just now and the girls actually look around my skin tone :/
is it possible to go from nc55 to nc45?
my problem is where i should match my foundation to .
my face is medium , my neck slightly darker and my chest so pale ( compare to face and arms ) it 's unbelieveable .
i would actually call my chest an nc 44 .
so what do i do ?
i feel i would look ghostly if i used nc45 but then my chest and face would be the same , help !
yes i have to different mac foundations because my skin changes all the time .
i would suggest going to the counter and asking them to match you again .
someone said that nw30 @/@ 35 is meant to be a good shade for ( brown/black ) people who find themselves changing shades
if you matched it to your chest would n't your neck look weird though ?
i would always say to match to your face as your natural colouring will always suit you best .
i 'm very pale __name1__ and my chest is darker than my face , if __quant1__ were to match to my chest __quant1__ 'd just look a bit mucky , like __quant1__ had n't washed in weeks , and __quant1__ think that if your foundation does n't completely blend into your natural skintone along your jawline you can look like you 're wearing a mask .
i recommend getting colour matched to your jawline and then adjust with bronzers/highlighters .
__quant1__ got my nose pierced a couple of weeks ago with a stud .
it 's not a bone so it is literally just a stud , similar to earrings .
because of this is falls out all the time as theres nothing inside to keep it in place .
i want to change to an __value1__ @-@ shaped stud , but i 'm worried it won't go in easily because i 've had it pierced with a straight stud .
any advice ?
why the hell did they pierce you with a straight stud ?
go back to the piercer and ask for it to be changed or find a piercer who will , they should be able to swap it without any fuss .
i had mine pierced with a straight stud , it was flipping awkward .
do n't do what i did though , and change it before the __quant1__ weeks or whatever , as you will probably get an infection which comes up as a nasty wart thing on your nose . d :
the __value1__ @-@ shaped studs are different to put in to the straight ones , but if you get the technique right , once you do it correctly , you can do it again .
you put the __value1__ bit of the __value2__ shape in the hole , making sure you can feel the tip of the end on the inside of your nose .
then press firmly , twisting slightly upwards and it should slide in .
if you still have troubles , just go see the piercer and they 'll put it in for you
i noticed i was getting these permanent forehead lines and that my face was a bit dry .
i decided to use some moisturizer and its helped .
do many other guys choose to moisturize ?
i use __name1__ for men :-)
the __quant2__ wash on my face , the exfoliating scrub twice __quant2__ week , and the anti @-@ shine moisturiser on a daily basis ( at least ) .
i have tried the cheaper brands , __name1__ and __name2__ , and i think they make my skin feel worse .
i use cheap generic moisturiser after shaving because my skin gets dry and sometimes tender after shaving .
i only do it after a shave because otherwise the facial hair stops it from melting into the skin properly .
any moisturiser labelled as ' aftershave balm ' or ' aftershave lotion ' or ' for men ' etc. is just a big rip off .
it is exactly the same stuff as cheap moisturiser but it is marketed towards meathead guys who think that moisturiser is ' liek so gay '.
__name1__ aftershave lotion is around £3 @-@ 5 for a tiny __quant1__ ml bottle wheras you can get a big __quant2__ ml bottle of generic stuff for about __quant3__ pound that has exactly the same effect .
this is just the modern day version of the old ' mansize tissues ' marketing one @-@ __quant1__ .
" oh , it has the word ' man ' in it so it is n't gay anymore "
i had grade 2 acne and it was particularly bad when i ' overwashed ' so i was compelled to wash less and to start moisturising ( __name1__ : __name1__ , after washing or shaving ) in my late teens .
i also use moisturising shower gel or i get bacne , nice
result is my skin is smoother than it is on some teenage girls ! -
goes down well with the ladies and __quant1__ look a lot younger than my __quant1__ , though that 's probably more to do with genetics eh
anyone else get one ?
i was very impressed after last months batiste fiasco ...
i got the ciate nail polish in kitten heels ilamasqua sheer lipgloss in explode nouveau strip lashes __name1__ regenerating body oil and xen @-@ tan deep bronze luxe .
what did you all think !
i think that is well worth £10 .
sounds good .
i like the idea of the glossy box and was going to sign up a couple of months ago . but i am worried incase i end up with a load of stuff __quant1__ just wont use .
the xen tan sounds good !
i want to sign up but i 'm worried i 'll get a load of rubbish too :/
i tried to order a maxi dress online last night from __name1__ , but when i entered my details , i was told the order had n't gone through .
so i tried inputting my details twice more , to no avail ....
so imagine my horror to see that i 'd been charged three times for an item that had n't gone through ? !
has anyone been in a similar situation ?
if so , how did you resolve it ?
any help would be appreciated
i read here somewhere that __name1__ had gone bust ?
i do n't know if they are just closing the stores or both but i think you should see if they have a number you can call .
i would also call your bank .
i just shaved all my hair off and i 'm feeling good .
i think i might buy a lace front wig tomorrow though .
my hair was badly damaged , it 's something that had to be done , it feels so weird .
i 've always wanted to do this but never had the courage .
congratulations !
i too would buy a lace front wig if i did it but they 're so damn expensive and time consuming to put on .
i do not know whether to buy a foundation primer - they are very expensive , being almost the same price as the foundation ( for example __name1__ foundation primer ) .
are they actually worth it ?
do they make a real difference to your skin , or is it just a marketing ploy ?
does anyone have any they would recommend ?
thank you in advance !
they 're definitely worth it , but i do n't wear a primer every day so i suppose i 'm willing to pay a bit more for them .
i only really wear a primer if i 'm going out .
depends what your skin is like , really .
as a general rule , if your skin is n't totally perfect , or if it 's a bit oily , then a primer is going to make your foundation last a lot longer and look a lot better .
i never used to use it , but in the last few weeks __quant1__ 've really seen a difference .
would you get , or do you know anybody who has gotten a __name1__ tattoo anywhere on their body ?
if you 're confused ( though i can n't see why you would be ) this is what i am talking about
and there are many , many more ...
now , i am as much of a __name1__ fan @-@ geek as the next person , but i would never dream of getting a huge hp montage on my body .
imo , while i do love __name1__ and have grown up with it etc. etc. , i know when i am 40+ years old i will look back upon the tattoo and wonder what made me decide to get it .
i can understand why people would want to get it done - it 's declaration of their love for __name1__ and stuff , but i personally would n't ever get a __name2__ tattoo .
some small quotes @/@ symbols do n't look too bad , but that 's just because i can appreciate the sentiments behind it .
but , while i think they do look pretty cool on other people , i know it is just a phase for me and that 's why i would never have it done .
any thought or opinions ?
has anyone actually had one done or is thinking about getting one done ?
it 's your body , up to you what you put on it .
sure you will get some funny looks and people will judge you .
kind of like those __name1__ tattoo 's middle aged women get , i find that more disturbing than young people getting __name2__ tattoo 's - they will probably look back when they are 30 @/@ 40 @/@ 50 and remember their childhood .
yet these people who get the tattoo 's aged 30+ already .... that 's another story .
yeah , i mean , it 's one thing to proclaim yourself as a fan of __name1__ , and another thing entirely to parade around as poster for it
tbh , most of what people get is just for the sake of getting a __name1__ tattoo , not necessarily because of the meaning or symbolism behind it ...
never.. they do realise that in 50+ years time , they 're still going to have " __name1__ " tattooed on them..?
imagine trying to explain that to your children @/@ grandchildren " yes , i did get a tattoo of something from a fiction book..."
i would never get it myself , but i would definitely love to meet a person who would and be their friend lol .... devotion to the next level
i wonder how outdated we will think __name1__ is __quant1__ years time
so after wearing glasses for about __quant1__ years now , i think its finally time to get contacts .
i would seriously appreciate some advise from people who use contacts already plz ! !
so there are these __name1__ ones which seem to be quite cheap :
and in contrast there are these ones that they sell @ __name1__ :
^^^ are almost double the price .
so my questions are :
a ) mite sound a bit stupid but would my vision be better with the more expensive ones ?
b ) are the __quant2__ better than the weeklies ( as they are cheaper )
c ) say if __quant2__ do get weeklies/monthlies , can i sleep @/@ go to the shower with them ?
d ) finaly , which shop @/@ website do you recommend and some buying advise would be realy good plz ! !
i 'd recommend going to your optician __value1__ , you need to know your exact prescription , and whether anything else needs to be looked at , e.g. astigmatism , whether you 'd suit wet ones or drier lenses .
i prefer the daily ones , as there 's no hassle of cleaning and storing them .
you can shower in lenses , but i would n't recommend sleeping in them .
i 've done it a couple of times by accident , and __quant1__ woke up in pain because they 'd moved around back and sort of folded over under my eyelid .
i personally would n't go for the cheapest ones .
my eyes and my teeth are the only thing i do n't skimp on , because it 's so ridiculously expensive when things go wrong with them that it 's just better to take very good care of them from the start .
hi all , essentially , i 'm looking for a " cover @-@ up " ( for lack of a better word ) i can wear __quant1__ .
i was wondering is primer alone suitable for this ?
the thing is i do n't like to wear foundation at all ( my face feels weird ) .
with regards to tinted moisturiser , i have __name1__ 's tinted moisturiser - it 's okay but i prefer to use it for night 's out or special events .
somehow it still feels heavy on my face .
is there a much lighter tined moisturiser out there ?
any advice or tips for what would be suitable for me to wear and brands ?
i 'd prefer to keep away from foundation if possible .
thank you !
i know what you said about foundation , but try __name1__ .
it 's really light , then use a powder brush to put a light dusting of a pressed powder .
if you 're just looking for a blemish cover , __name1__ do a blemish stick which covers a multitude of sins .
make sure you remove any make up with a good non greasy cleanser if you do n't want pizza face
primer does n't usually give any coverage .
tinted moisturiser gives a little , but imo does n't do much at all and i do n't like the feel and texture on my skin .
i used a __name1__ as it was ok , but slightly greasy
i 'd just get a really light foundation e.g. __name1__
do you remember that movie that was based on nothern __name1__ by __name2__ ?
how come they never made a sequal ?
i was shocked..there was so much hype when it came out ... it was so anticipated ... x
well in the series of __name2__ books , the next one in the sequence is called __name1__ , i guess they would make a film of that rather than calling it the golden compass 2 .
i imagine they would n't make a sequel because the __value1__ film was n't very good .
if they even think of calling it " the golden compass 2 ", i will go into __name1__ .
it pissed me off enough that they change northern lights to the golden compass for no apparent reason as it is , let alone ****ing up the rest of the trilogy .
the film sold well in __name1__ but poorly in __name2__ , as a lot of religious groups saw the film as anti @-@ __name3__ @/@ religion and so it got a lot of bad press .
the __name1__ market is what matters ( afterall , they took the american title of the book , not the original title ) , so all plans for a sequel were canned .
not to mention that __name1__ stripped off all the references to religion it possibly could , but that 's pretty much impossible in the sequels .
how can you kill __name1__ without any religious context ?
so if there was bad press for the __value1__ film it 'd only get a million times worse by the time the last film came out .
to many fans it 's difficult to see how __name1__ could 've even carried the series forward since it left out a lot of the important parts of the magesterium that is developed in the sequels .
in short , if there is ever to be a __name3__ trilogy , it 'll have to be from a __name1__ film production company who do n't care what the __name2__ thinks .
it would 've been nice if someone decided to take it on after the __name1__ film craze dies down , but since it 's been tried __quant1__ and failed __quant1__ think it 's going to be a good few years ( __quant2__ or so ? ) before anyone thinks of touching it again .
hopefully if it happens they 'll do a __name1__ and film it in __quant1__ big go rather than wait to see if the box office figures validate a sequel . :/
i do n't either but i can see why he 's doing it .
__name1__ is re @-@ releasing __name2__ with __quant1__ additional minutes of footage .
people might think it 's a waste of effort , but those __quant1__ minutes will no doubt bring him at least , a few more __quant2__ $$$ in the bank , just like this __quant3__ crap will for __name1__ .
depends on the film , i thought it was interesting to see __name1__ in 3d , but no other movie since has interested me in __quant1__ ( __name2__ in 3d is a joke )
on the subject of __name1__ , as a massive fan since i was a child this saddens me as i would like the films to be left as they are . ( saying that i do agreed with the remastering they did for the __value1__ th anniversary ... )
though being the whore that i am ... i will probably splash the cash to watch __name1__ on the big screen again ...
__name1__ money @-@ grabber cashes in while contributing to destroying new technology - shocker .
i also disagree with people who would say " why not ? ".
artistic integrity , for instance .
it would be far more appealing to see those films fully remastered in __name1__ , rather than a tacky bandwagon jump , and it would still rake in money .
the problem is " good " is still a long way off the kind of images audiences expect .
without the force , an after @-@ conversion will never even begin to look good .
if you had __quant1__ films , which were n't released in their in @-@ universe chronological order originally , would n't you want to change it for any subsequent release ?
the prequels would definitely be improved with __quant2__ , because like __name1__ they 're all about spectacle and explosions and the " plot " is really just there to string the spectacle and explosions along for __quant1__ hours .
you can n't tell me you would n't want to see , say , the opening battle in __name1__ in __quant1__ ?
that was awesome enough in the cinema anyway , but it could really be enhanced by __name1__ doing their thang .
i am less optimistic about the core films being convincing in 3d , because as much as i love their visual effects , they were designed __quant2__ years before people even began talking about the possibility of __quant1__ as it has been realised today .
they have held up very well because the story and characters are strong , not because the visual effects are up to much , revolutionary though they were at the time .
still , this is __name1__ we 're talking about here , hopefully all __quant1__ films will come out looking pretty good .
however what i really want is a __name1__ @-@ __name1__ collection of all __quant1__ .
hurry the **** up , __name1__ .
has anyone heard of this film ?
it stars , among others , __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ and __name4__ .
it has received some amazing reviews .
it is going to be officially released here in the __name1__ next year in __month1__ , but it is going to be shown at the __name2__ next month .
i read the screenplay a while ago .
a lot of visual potential but a little weak in the storytelling department .
hopefully __name1__ has been able to turn it around , though i 'm not really digging the trailer - __name2__ anyone ?
it has __name1__ kissing __name2__ in one scene .
it 's safe to say the film will attract viewers .
id played a video game called the __name1__ but there is already a film coming out .
for those , who have watched it . what is the feedbacks ?
planning to see the movie alone
i think it looks awful , personally .
i really can n't stand that actress because she plays the most annoying characters ever , and her character in __name1__ really grates in just the trailers .
not to mention that the script sounds horrendous .
i have n't seen it though ...
i was gonna ask if i was the only one who thought this , but a quick google search of ' __name1__ racist ' answers that question .
was the film racist ?
was it intentional , to add to the vapid ignorance of the characters ?
was it intentional pro @-@ __name1__ propaganda ?
or am i , and many critics , making something out of nothing ?
thoughts __name1__ ?
it was kinda insulting to their culture .
but the whole thing was exaggerated for the purpose of enhancing the storyline , e.g the clash between __name1__ 's rampant sexuality and the " cover up " stereotype of __name2__ countries .
i do n't think anybody should get on their high horse about it , people only insult it because it 's __name1__ , nobody gives a **** about stuff like that in other films .
i was watching __name1__ and i realised how some of the things in the film apply to me eg pushing yourself away from people because you 're scared that they 'll find you imperfections etc.
that really got me thinking about my life and what i need to change so if you have any films that have changed you personally or have made you change your outlook on life then plz share .
if you 're thinking , think about something useful and interesting which will get you somewhere : maths .
i agree there 's more than education .
if you do n't want to think , you could get wasted or do something else etc.
if you 're spending your time thinking , make it useful thinking , that 's all i 'm saying .
__name1__ . __name2__ , i know a lot of people got hooked up on the gore and ' sickness ' of it , but the whole point of that film was philosophy about life and it did get me thinking for a while .
actually it led to a lengthy , involved discussion at uni in which someone ended up crying . so definitely good for thinking about life .
and if you 're willing to watch something that is n't a film but still goes in the dvd player , then any of the __name1__ stuff
if anyone has n't said __name1__ yet , then that gets my vote !
i saw the trailer for it and have yet to see the whole thing , but it looks amazing .
and i do n't necessarily think this film is going to make you think hard about life , but.. i also recommend watching __name1__ .
it 's good if you 're into a film noir kinda thing .
cant believe no @-@ one has mentioned __name1__ , the only time i have shed a tear infront of the tv since seeing __name2__ loose the __name3__ when i was __quant1__ .
serious stuff , this movie is immense and has affected me more then any other film or tv show .
__name1__ is pretty good as well as providing laugh .
i dont know if you genuinely believe this or if you are just trying to act the adult .
a life having been spent entirely on academia whether it be maths or anthropology at the cost of missing essential human experiences is the biggest waste of a life imaginable .
did anyone know ?
__name1__ page
the film is classed comedy @-@ drama and is supposedly about the creators and the founding of __name1__ .
__name1__ has been around for __quant1__ years now and the question is , does it warrant a film ?
are the makers hoping every __name1__ user . around 200 million globally will watch the film ?
bit of a stupid idea how film production companies will make a movie about this when there a far better movie scripts out there .
why not make a film about __name1__ ?
that 's got a better founding story than __name1__ .
why is __name1__ in it ?
are they just trying anything to make it big ?
i personally use __name1__ and think it 's a useful thing to have , but to be honest why would i want to see a film about it ?
i like seeing comedies , or thrillers , or action films.. but a film about the founders of __name1__ ?
yeah __quant1__ heard about that about __quant1__ year ago when it __value1__ went into production .
i 'm really interested to see what comes of it given the cast and ( especially ) __name1__ directing with __name2__ scripting ! !!
the __name1__ has announced that they will permit __quant1__ nominees for the __name2__ category instead of the usual __quant2__ .
the reason behind the change is that the __name1__ , in the face of falling ratings , wants to attract more popularity to __name2__ .
what do you think of this change ?
what would you do to make __name1__ more popular ?
or do you think the rise of the internet and etc will inevitably slowly kill off __name1__ ?
i 'm still fuming about __name1__ not getting an __name2__ .
similarly , i am still pissed that __name2__ was awarded __name1__ last year .
it is a travesty !
it was good no doubt , but the best ?
the judging panel just jumped on the bangwagon surrounding the media hype .
i think __name1__ should have won the __name2__ award , but they did n't even nominate that film .
out of the nominated ones , i think __name1__ was much better than __name2__ .
though __name1__ @/@ __name1__ was pretty good as well .
( __name1__ and the __name2__ films were crap .)
so in the last week , the new head of __name2__ , __name1__ , has said : “ all teachers should be qualified ”.
what an absolutely preposterous suggestion !
you mean to say that , as citizens of this great nation , our children should be taught by professional people who have gone through the necessary rigmarole to be let loose in our schools ?
how dare we expect that from our education system . and while we 're at it - why stop there ?
let 's round up our homeless and get them working in our hospitals .
it 'll get them off the streets and straight into promising careers .
youth unemployment is rife at the moment so let 's get them piloting our aeroplanes .
__name1__ might even get its __value1__ runway so we could do with a few more pilots .
i heard overcrowding in jails is a problem too - especially since the rioting last summer .
why do n't we just convert the miscreants to our side by giving them a uniform and a gun ?
they 're bound to see sense and start making our streets safer instead of causing the trouble .
and lastly , with the __name1__ holidays coming up , young children will need something to keep them occupied .
maybe they can try writing for a sunday tabloid - i hear there are vacancies at __name1__ .
you may have sensed my slight sarcastic undertones - although that last suggestion might not be such a bad idea .
call me naive , but i always assumed that teachers were either qualified or training alongside someone qualified ?
it seems though that any old sod can do it .
is it any wonder then that the __name1__ 's position in the international league tables has slipped ?
so despite sounding incredibly obvious , mr __name1__ seems to have hit the nail on the head .
problem solved .
i 'm sure it comes as a welcome suggestion to all the fully trained , out @-@ of @-@ work teachers who struggle to get a job .
not to mention the ones who have jobs and have worked extremely hard to get there .
so until then - if you 're passing by your child 's school , you might want to pop your head around the classroom door .
just to make sure one of the dinner ladies is n't also teaching maths .
all teachers should be able to teach .
some piece of paper from a teaching academy does not equate to , by definition , being capable of teaching .
i think all we need to do is think of some teachers we have had to know this .
and at the same time i think we can all think of great teachers who have not had a piece of paper from a teacher training college .
with this notion of qualifications there is an unholy alliance of __quant1__ groups of people .
the __value1__ is the well intended sponsors who think enforcing such rules will improve education by keeping so called unqualified teachers out .
the __value1__ is the special interest group , the teachers unions , who want to keep competition out so they want a piece of paper that teachers need to have .
this piece of paper is just another barrier to entry for outsiders and keeps the incumbent teachers safer from competition .
the teachers unions hate competition and they have done a very good job of fending off competition under the guise of the public interest
fortunately we have things like the __name1__ now that are going to seriously screw those monopolistic selfish bastards over .
suck on that educational establishment .
this is a story about __name1__ on __name2__
__value1__
unsurprisingly the most liked comments defend the __name1__ , the rest all praise the bnp , whether it be in a stealthy way or openly ( most of the " best rated " comments openly support the bnp ) .
majority of the " worst rated " comments on that site criticise the __name1__ .
i conclude that most of the readers of that paper are __name1__ sympathisers or supporters .
p.s i would have been for the __name1__ if they just were n't racist or presented themselves as a " __name2__ party which support christian values ", some of their policies e.g " get out of __name3__ ", " stop being __name4__ 's poodle ", " kick out __name5__ who dont integrate ", " eradicate __name6__ fundamentalism from britian " e.t.c really interest me .
i wish liberals supported the policies i mentioned
while i too think most of their readers are racist , i think for the majority they are more " friendly " racists than " __name1__ " racists .
by friendly i mean that while they harbour racist views , they are perfectly polite to anyone of any race and do n't go around being openly racist or discriminate against individuals .
still not a great quality to have , but nowhere near the level of vitriole as the __name1__ .
i would n't compare them directly to the __name1__ - most of the readers are white middle class people who find many of the changes in society scary and the __name2__ gives them stereotypes to blame without using too complicated language .
whilst it 's an awful paper , comparing its entire readership to some of the monsters in the __name1__ party is wrong .
please post in this thread all discussion relating to the recent rise in tension between the __name1__ and __name2__ over the issue of the sovereignty of the __name3__ .
__name1__ is growing quite rapidly compared to the __name2__ , but that is beside the point .
if __name2__ were to launch a surprise attack and take the island 's airfields , then __name1__ would be effectively unable to retaliate due to lack of an aircraft carrier .
keep pretending everything is fine , though .
__name1__ - yes .
__name1__ 's armed forces - no.
__name1__ launch a surprise attack ?
well , it would certainly be surprising , not least to the members of their armed forces using the same kit they did in ' 82 .
they 'd be astonished to learn that they had suddenly discovered the requisite experience , training and equipment to make such a landing possible .
not to mention we have the southern hemisphere 's most capable attack aircraft stationed on the fis .
yes , we 're without an aircraft carrier , meaning we cannot retaliate in the same way we did in ' 82 .
however , this does not mean we cannot retaliate .
we 've proven that the __name1__ can fly from __name2__ to the __name3__ .
the __name1__ can still launch a task force that would , if allowed to fight openly , utterly decimate the __name2__ navy and we retain the ability to launch __name3__ directly through __name4__ 's window should we wish .
they would have to be suicidal .
pretty cool eh ?
what do people think about in @-@ vitro meat ?
would you eat it ?
as a matter of interest to the vegetarians and vegans out there , if it was n't mixed with blood , and was simply stem @-@ cell grown , would you eat it
( i can see why vegans might be opposed , but i 'm unsure about vegetarians )
if it benefited my health then i would probably eat it .
sounds interesting . though i doubt they 'll be able to replicate the taste of a good bit of beef any time soon .
for fast food places where the meat they use is terrible anyway it should n't affect things much .
it might be the key to the survival of the human race .
how do vegetarians view this ?
all the things they could research to do with stem cells and they come up with this ?
time is running out for the __name1__ to return home .
these people were illegally removed from their homeland to make way for the __name1__ military base on __name2__ , leased to the us from the __name3__ for a __quant1__ year period , which could be renewed for a further __quant2__ years in __year1__ , if the us so wish .
i 'd urge anyone to watch this video for deeper understanding of this atrocity : - __value1__
if you are short of time please take a few minutes to watch this : - __value1__
after witnessing these events , i hope us educated tsrians have the view that democracy should prevail , and no one should be forcibly removed from their homes .
not many know about these atrocities , but help spread the word .
and please sign this petition to raise awareness , and hopefully ( yes , being very hopeful here ) it will one day be debated in the __name1__ . __value1__
thank you .
i signed it .
with all the stuff going with the __name2__ , i think this makes the __name1__ seem a bit hypocritical .
i 'll sign the petition if you remove the highlighted part from your post .
it 's inflammatory and a cheap attack on coalition forces .
when actual innocent civilians do die it 's regretable , but we both know that they are n't the intended target .
you clearly put that there to win brownie points with the anti @-@ war crowd despite this issue having nothing at all to do with the conflicts in __name1__ and __name2__ and infact bomber operations out of __name3__ completely ceased over __quant1__ years ago .
i happened to watch a news review on __name3__ this morning in which a bunch of journo 's were bleating on that we should n't condemn all the " innocent " and hard working journalists at __name1__ just because a whole bunch of hacks at __name2__ were arrested ...
because that would cause untold damage to the whole media industry .
oh poor them .
this is precsisely , is it not ? , what the whole media has been doing to the banking industry for the last __quant1__ years or so ?
total hypocrisy .
it is important to seperate the innocent from the guilty in both industries but it 's ironic that the papers have been selling copy by basically tarring all bankers with the same brush and slagging them off mercilessly for __quant1__ .
isnt __name3__ owned by __name1__ which is owned by __name2__ or something ?
it doesnt surprise me though , lets hope __name1__ goes down .
the media condemning bankers is akin to a witch hunt , __name1__ was given just a £6.5m bonus in 2010 yet jpmorgan 's top executive was paid $ 21m that year .
__name1__ was employed because of his excellent show of skills after his success in safely defusing the explosive capital @-@ market business of __name2__ .
the media seem to have mixed up the man responsible for the merge with __name1__ with the man responsible for fixing the failure of __name2__ .
moral of the story : the media will always present news in a way which forwards their views , it 's that simple .
i recently came across __quant1__ stories , one about a __name1__ in the __name2__ who was arrested and sentenced to up to __quant2__ years for having an " affair " with a __quant3__ year old girl , and another where a woman in __name3__ was given up to __quant4__ years for having sex with a __quant5__ year old boy .
for the sake of argument , lets say a __quant1__ year old woman was having sex with a __quant2__ year old boy and similarly a __quant3__ year old man was having sex with a __quant4__ year old girl .
i can n't think of a good reason why either of these scenarios should be worse than the other , but deep down i seem to feel that the first scenario is n't that serious at all .
in order to give a reason as to why they are different i 'd have to admit a difference in free will between young guys and girls , which is hard to do .
but for some reason it almost seems like the __quant2__ year old man is some sort of predator whereas the __quant2__ year old woman is only misguided .
in keeping with this the __quant2__ year old girl was taken advantage of whereas the __quant2__ year old boy was lucky .
note that in both cases the sex was consensual , obviously not legally , but in the sense that there was n't any physical compulsion .
so i 'm not saying if a __quant1__ year boy was forcibly touched by a woman it would be ok .
i had a discussion about this with my girlfriend , she thinks both are serious .
i agree , but also seem to have this almost sexist view that the boy was really hurt at all .
what do you guys think ?
is it sexism or is sex between teenage boys and older woman just fundamentally different ?
i think it seems less serious because __quant1__ @-@ year @-@ old boys talk about having sex with an " older woman " as if it were an achievement .
whereas to a __quant1__ @-@ year @-@ old girl , if an older man was interested in her she 'd consider him a dirty pervert .
therefore it seems unlikely that the girl consented , whereas most would believe the boy would be very much up for it .
well suppose the __quant1__ year old girl felt the guy loved her and wanted to have sex with him .
it still seems that it 's worse because for some reason i 'd think the man had manipulated her in some way whereas in the other case i would n't really feel the boy had been duped .
i think this is n't a good way to think about it but it seems fairly prevalent .
yes , i saw that .
my point is , people would n't believe that . that 's why it seems worse .
girl : " but i wanted sex with him ! " - most would assume she was brainwashed , groomed .
boy : " but i wanted sex with her ! " - most would assume that yes , he probably did .
anyone else think it 's a bit ridiculous that this man actually got arrested for making a monkey gesture ?
it did n't hurt anyone , and whilst it may be offensive to some , surely this is n't an arrestable offence ?
i mean , where 's the line between un @-@ pc and illegal ?
no , i do n't think it was ridiculous .
whilst no one wants to stop banter , the intention of this was clear : to cause offence .
it was disgraceful and totally unacceptable .
criminal charges + lifetime ban from all grounds methinks .
i 'm a __name1__ fan and there can be no excuse for this behaviour .
i hope he is banned from football for life ( not just anfield ) .
i honestly do n't understand racist people .
no he should have been arrested .
i hope the __name1__ ban him from all matches for life , and the courts give him a suspended sentence and some kind of community service .
what i do n't understand is in the film __name2__ , __quant1__ of the detectives , who was white , called __name1__ , who is also white , a monkey .
now , unless i 'm missing something here , i 'm pretty sure __name1__ is n't black , and monkey means black person , does n't it ?
so what was this detective using the word ' monkey ' for if it was n't to mean black person ?
i 'm terribly confused .
it 's short but if you do n't want to read it basically a guy in the __name1__ has been arrested for agreeing to meet up with and have sex with a " __quant1__ year old girl " who was actually an undercover cop ...
surely this is entrapment ?
he did n't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation ?
sure , it would be a crime if he had actually done this with a __quant1__ year old and something had happened when they met up ...
but the __name1__ police have basically created this whole scenario and lead him into it , feeding him along ?
this suggests to me that the police officer was the one who suggested everything ...
coaxed him into it ...
we do n't know the full story but i get the impression that this " __quant1__ year old girl " offered him sex on a plate willingly ....
would that be legal in this country ?
i mean i think it 's wrong that this guy would meet up with a __quant1__ year old with the intent to have sex ...
but fabricating the situation ... you can n't arrest someone for something they have n't done ... it 's just wrong ...
am i the only one who thinks this is messed up ?
from previous similar stories , what usually happens is that the undercover officer behind the screen is extremely passive ( as a normal young innocent teenager would probably be ) and then agrees to meet up with the potential paedophile , if he shows up at the place then he is guilty .
i see nothing wrong with this morally , he knows the girl is __quant1__ and still decides to meet her ( having previously stated his intentions through __name1__ ) .
if that is the case then i understand and agree , it 's just the way the article is written it sounds as if the police officer is doing a lot of the work , and it 's in __name1__ so different laws to here .
they do this and it works , there is even a show about it .
to me its fine , if the suspect has to make a choice , ie leave his home and go to a location , then i do n't really care if he is encouraged .
not that recent but it has gone under the radar for months .
it 's graphic so that is why it is in spoilers .
strange that __name1__ keeps it up , but it 's not horrifically graphic like things on __name2__ .
story is basically that they were targeted for refusing to believe in __name1__ @/@ __name2__ as their saviour .
guess they did n't get the versions with the execution parts edited out ?
inb4 '' you can n't judge all __name1__ on a remote village in __name2__ ''
i 'm not , i 'm just posting it .
what planet are you on ?
go to the gore websites that dont restrict content and you 'll get so many things about __name1__ .
the majority of the world may be in the __century1__ st century but that crap hole is still in the dark ages .
there 's nothing to stop these people what they 're doing , either .
i imagine the town is either under the grip of religion , or too scared to protest simply because of the nature of these punishments .
another bullet point on the big list of things atheists did n't do .
how __name1__ of them !
it would be a bit silly to suggest only __name1__ have done things like this .
what do we think ?
will this mean a weaker __name1__ ?
something that struck me watching a __name4__ debate on this issue was the attitude of some __name1__ people , such as the obnoxious __name2__ journalist on the panel , that __name3__ independence was good because then we would n't have to subsidise them for being poor .
he even made some kind of play on words involving the word " skint ".
__name1__ probably receives more than its fair share of __name2__ government spending in terms of its share of the population .
i believe this is because it is , on average , poorer than __name1__ .
the way some __name1__ people sneer at the __name2__ for being poor and therefore receiving more government spending would n't , i presume , be directed at poor areas of england .
the north , __name1__ , the south @-@ west , east __name2__ and many other areas of the __name3__ get more than their proportional share of spending , because they need it .
i think it 's wrong to resent the __name1__ poor for being __name1__ , because i 'm sure such complaints would n't be made about poor regions of __name2__ .
i was also annoyed by a woman in the audience who said __name1__ should be independent ( she was __name4__ ) because " all countries should be independent ", including __name2__ and " __name3__ ".
this is such a simplistic view .
should __name1__ be independent ?
should __name1__ split from __name3__ @-@ speaking __name2__ ?
should __name1__ join with the __name2__ ?
should __name1__ be independent ?
should the __name1__ be independent ?
should bavarian , or __name1__ , or sicilian , or catalan , or bosnian @-@ serbs , or __name2__ __name3__ have independence ?
loads of places have their own histories , cultures , devolved governments , languages and so on .
just because __name1__ was an independent state __quant1__ years ago , does n't mean it should be today .
the definition of " country " is more complex than that woman 's personal black and white judgements .
culturally i feel __name1__ and i want britain to stay together .
but i recognise there are convincing political and economic reasons the __name1__ have for independence and i do n't think __name2__ 's reponse on __name3__ of " we 're stronger together " had enough real substance to it .
i support him , but unionists need to express in more real terms why we 're stronger together .
another interesting issue is the advantage to the __name1__ if __name3__ @-@ dominated __name2__ breaks away .
the __name1__ guy made this point and __name2__ immediately quoted numbers prooving that actually scottish __name3__ have never been significant in the balance of power in the __name4__ .
( take that sensationalist journalist who has n't got their facts straight ! )
and then there 's the issue of timing .
it may well be tactical on the part of the __name1__ to wait until __year1__ , but i think it 's practical too .
who gets the __name1__ subs ?
who gets the armed forces ?
does __name1__ stay in the __name2__ ?
does it keep the pound ?
what about their oil ?
do the __name1__ have a say ?
these are all in my view huge issues .
it 's the biggest decision in __quant1__ years and it needs to be made slowly i think .
give the __name2__ __quant1__ years to make their minds up , because it 's not as simple as the __name1__ government wants to make out .
i do applaud them though for trying to get the legal issues sorted out .
i am so tired of this debate , but i guess it 's going to keep cropping up .
independence would be worse for both __name1__ and the rest of the __name2__ .
as __name1__ are we really so different that we 'd toss aside the political , cultural and economic benefits of the union so that we can massage our own egos and yell " freedom ! "?
there was an __name1__ canvaser at my door today , so my mum decided to annoy him , and told him she voted __name2__ ... for which he had no response and got all flustered , then when asked which party she would vote for in the next election she said she did n't vote for a party , she voted for a person , and he got confused , then she said she would n't vote for independence , and he was genuinely surprised and did n't know what to say
the __name1__ seem to think that just because they won the election it means that the whole country wants independence , when actually they probably won the election because they wanted free prescriptions , free tuition , free care for the elderly etc. while other parties were n't offering as much ( although , it does beg the question of where exactly all this money is coming from ? )
now for a bit of intentional controversial and completely ignorant ' tarring with the same brush ' type questions :
is this what ' __name1__ ' people think ?
i know many people do n't think like this bitch but this is appaling .
should she have her kid taken away from her ?
you see the other ' __name1__ ' woman did n't defend the others but was more concerned with having to take care of her baby that was about to wake up , which means __quant1__ ' british ' woman was being racist , and the other ' __name1__ ' woman was just letting it pass , being more worried about something else .
so does that mean that most ' __name1__ ' woman think like this ?
you also have to admit that the lady arguing with the raving bitch had no reason to say ' we 're here because you do n't work , go find a job ', that 's wrong and a bit racist within itself .
the like to dislike ration on this video is around 3 @:@ 1 , what does that show ?
what do you think ?
if you allow her to have this opinion is it because you project the same feelings ?
what would be the point in arguing with her ?
the women is so steeped in her own ignorance it would take years to educate her
she 's entitled to her own opinion .
someone should have just given her a slap just to shut her up
wow , she 's gonna be really pissed in about __quant1__ years . hahaha !
but seriously , if all __name1__ @/@ __name2__ people were like her ..... why would anyone want to be english/british .
i actually think she has something wrong with her , whether she is on drugs or drunk .
but she is slurring a lot .
the fact she called __name1__ ... nygigreeah.... i think she was half with it ...
no @-@ one in their right mind , starts screaming and swearing like that , with their young child sat on their lap ...
also , to say most __name1__ women think the same , is wrong .
i 'm a __name1__ woman and would never dream of acting like that .
you said the __quant1__ other __name1__ lady did not stand up for the others , but ...
1 . she actually did , by telling the loud mouthed cow to shut up .
2 . although she should n't have to , why do you think she has to get involved ?
just because she is __name1__ ?
3 . several other people , who were n't british did n't get involved ... does that make them racist too..?
4 . if i were in that situation , and i had a child with me , i would try my hardest not to get involved , as it would n't be fair on my child .
but if the arguing caused my child to be disturbed , then i would have done the same and got involved .
i agree that what i have watched in this video is sickening , but i disagree with several points you have made .
and i would actually say some of your points are rather racist and offensive to __name1__ women .
you may be angry at what you have seen , but that is no reason to group all __name1__ women as racist .
seems stabbing is becoming as regular as farting , soon there will be so many knives on the streets it will bring back the __name1__ 's steel making to what it was __quant1__ years ago .
along with tougher sentancing i dont know what else could be done that would'nt upset the bleeding heart liberals ( no pun intended )
i would rather be stabbed by a childish fool than be harassed by the police on __quant1__ basis .
edit : i will clarify - i would rather take the risk of being stabbed than have my freedom infringed on a regular basis .
did u know statistically ethnic minorites are more than likely to be stopped and searched .
just saying that this kind of measure to stop and search anyone @- i do n't really see as appropriate .
recently __name1__ decided to ban the burka in public places in the interest of public security .
i both agree and disagree with this statement .
some women feel the burka empowers them , but other feel trapped by it .
so is it a public security issue or just some anti semetic judgement ?
is a piece of cloth wrong ? in what way ?
intimidating or forcing one into dressing a particular way is wrong .
it has been said that if teenages cannot wear hoodies in shops as it conceals their identity why should somebody to wear a burka ?
i 'm a __name1__ and i did n't agree with much of what he said , but i can n't deny that he was a fantastic orator .
whether you agree with his views or not , you have to respect the man 's incredible intellect and sharp wit .
i happen to agree with his views on religion and so i must thank him for teaching me an incredble amount of factual knowledge but more importantly , the ability to think critically .
i do n't have any __name2__ so __quant1__ hope __quant1__ glass of this __name1__ will suffice .
thank you for everything __name1__ .
you are truly my inspiration .
__quant1__ was a __name1__ fanboi for __quant1__ year or so and the fact this is actually really quite upsetting is a testament to just how good his writing is , that he can have such an incredible impact on peoples lives .
even the guy above who is a glad he is dead has been seduced by the __name1__ 's writing in that you either devote yourself to him or hate him above all else .
( that guy is obviously far too stupid to comprehend this though guys so best to just ignore him )
i was n't such a fan of his habit of preaching opinion as truth , then again i 'm not a big fan of rhetoric in general .
nevertheless , he exercised his right to freedom of speech to the nth degree and gave a lot of people strength in the process .
he will be missed .
a contrarian and freethinker until the end . he left no one untouched ... from __name1__ to __name2__ and __name3__ .
a fantastic orator , extremely well @-@ read and a sharp wit ...
it 's a sad , sad loss .
we need more people that go out of their way to challenge the " false refuge of consensus " he has referred to and warned against seeking .
i 'm coming across so many good quotes from him !
on __name1__ : " he 's doing to the country what he can no longer do to his wife ."
on a tv __name1__ : " if you gave him an enema you could bury him in a matchbox ."
i may have supported his anti @-@ religiousness but , whatever your opinion on it , you have to admire the courage of his convictions .
he only said what he thought was right and , if we had more people around today like that ( namely in politics ) , the world would be a better place .
when i heard about his death this morning my mood completely shifted .
his writings and speeches were such a huge influence on me during those most tumultuous teenage __quant1__ , the __quant1__ in which __quant1__ was " tentatively feeling my way into the life of the freethinker " in the words of __name1__ , and served as a brilliant rebuttal to the dogma i was being fed in __name2__ school .
i had the pleasure of seeing __name1__ at the " __name2__ " last year here in __name3__ and in retrospect , i 'm glad i had that opportunity before his untimely , yet nonetheless inevitable demise .
what are the chances that tm when we wake up in the morning , we switch on to the news and see breaking news that prince __name1__ has died after overnight heart problems
the guy is in his __quant1__ 's
what are the chances he survives this so far look very silm
i pray for his swift recovery and many more years of life and service to the __name1__ and __name2__ .
much as i am fond of the royal family if he dies i really hope we do n't end up seeing a load of scenes that would not look out of place in __name1__ and a media circus .
it is about time someone reminded all these naive women that no matter what your " rights " are , you still have to take responsibility for your safety or sadly face the consequences .
edit : so ... __quant1__ __quant2__ people would risk being raped rather than getting a taxi ?
well do n't come crying to __name1__ when you get a reality check .
it 's a sad fact of our society that you have to think ahead all the time to ensure your safety .
it should n't be - you should be able to dance down backalleys naked , drunk at __time1__ in the morning if you wanted to without anyone trying to cause you harm , but unfortunately there are always those who will take advantage , so you should always watch your drinks , stay within your limit and never ever wander off on your own .
oh thank __name1__ , someone talking sense .
why are we telling women not to get raped instead of telling men not to rape ?
it 's not like getting a taxi is even something everyone can do .
you can n't always afford a taxi ( especially if you 're in __name1__ ! ) , you can n't always flag one down , you might not have a working phone on you ( lack of credit , lack of battery ) and you might have a phone but no idea of local taxi numbers .
does this mean you deserve to be raped ?
obviously not .
the point here should be ' if you see a woman walking alone at night , do n't rape her ' as opposed to ' if you 're a woman , or have any chance of being perceived as one , do n't walk around alone at night '.
it is easier for men not to rape than women not to be raped .
you just do n't rape .
edit : i seem to have been misconstrued by a couple of people here , so i 'll elaborate .
women have a responsibility to mitigate the risk of bad things happening to them , like any of us .
i am not saying that women should realistically be able to dance down back alleys naked .
i am saying that the only person with the power to eradicate the risk is the prospective perpetrator .
if a girl is raped , it is not her fault even if she did n't take the adequate measures to mitigate risk , because that risk would have been there irrespective of how careful she may have been .
rape victims do not have the power to prevent rape .
only the would @-@ be rapist does .
on that basis , the above interviewer 's handling of the subject seems to me to have been insensitive in the extreme .
women should not be made to feel bad for having been raped .
now if these lot rioting and looting were __name1__ or , __name3__ forbid __name2__ , forum would be filled with anti @-@ multiculturalism rhetoric - where derogative comments about an entire group of people would be acceptable .
often these people would decry the " pc liberal media " for not calling it out .
so , we all know the crime problems in the black community in __name1__ , why are n't you calling it out as an example of multiculturalism failing ?
you 're probably thinking it , but do n't want to say it .
heaven forbid , have you become politically correct overnight ?
you clearly have n't been on __name1__ today .
there are have been numerous threads about the black community etc.
it kind of gets boring after a while .
they are : i do n't know about __name1__ , but you should look at the comments on the telegraph website .
mind , they do n't need much encouragement .
why should it be a racial thing .
most of the past riots have been majorly white , nobody starts banging on about race then and they should n't .
i 've seen a lot of racism today and its unacceptable .
forget about race
found this blog earlier which talks about the need to slow population growth .
the blogger puts forward a __quant1__ child policy as the answer .
any thoughts ?
the only countries that would be able to implement this already have birth rates below replacement ( or will do soon )
the only area of real population growth in the future is going to be __name1__ , and i can n't imagine any african states being able to exert this level of control and organisation on their citizens .
most of the words that come out of his mouth these days seem to be trying to lure __name1__ votes .
it seems that he knows under the current population changes ( if it continues ) that __name1__ will eventually unite .
but how can he possibly ' end sectarianism ' if members of his party come out with purely bigotory remarks ( such as __name1__ 's in the summer time )?
how can he possibly change the mind set of unionists who vote for nationalist parties ( __name1__ ) purely to keep __name2__ out of a seat ?
how can he change the mindset of hardline nationalists who see __name1__ as traitors and refuse to vote at all ?
it seems that such a beautiful land had been created that it had to be balanced out , so it was sent the most evil of inhabitants to curse the land forever ...
i think it 's a noble aspiration and , yes , unionists need to reach out to __name1__ .
there 's nothing ideologically unsound about that - after all , most __name2__ in __name3__ , __name4__ and __name5__ are __name1__ , why should history prevent that from being the case in __name6__ ?
i 've not heard his full remarks , just what i garnered from the radio and a couple of short bits in articles , but it really sounded good and - whilst i still can n't bring myself to think of the __name1__ as decent , mainstream and cross @-@ community - i think it 's a step in the right direction .
it surprised me .
do n't particularly give a ****.
never been to __name1__ .
however , if the majority want to keep up a union with __name1__ then that 's fine .
what 's everyone 's opinions of it ?
does it bring out __name1__ pride ?
does it look like a piece of junk ?
tell me .
it really is n't very good looking is it . even from a distance .
kinda looks like a rollar coaster with some ugly grey tower going up the middle of it .
ahh well , good to know tax payers money is being well spent .
at least , i 'm guessing the tax payer payed for this .
nasty tv guys ! yuc , i hate them
if he wants it done , i do n't see what the problem is .
i dont think there is anything wronge with the except for the name of the program ; " mumifying alan "
he agreed to do it .
what 's the problem ?
i do n't see why so many people are against grammar schools , when really segregation happens anyway in comprehensive schools .
the best abled pupils get put into the " top " set and usually get the best teacher in the subject department etc.
if that 's the case then why not just reintroduce grammar schools instead of doing this half hearted attempt at trying to make it look like everything is equal ?
really , what was the point in the government making me eat lunch in the same room as violent yobo 's anyway and having to watch out for being attacked in the hall way or fireworks snuck in ?
i feel like they were just trying to piss me off , and i kind of am , at them and the __name1__ who push for this kind of crap .
are n't they phasing out grammar schools ?
there was one not far from me but it 's just a regular middle @/@ high school now .
where i 'm from __value1__ % of children will pass the __name1__ and get into the grammar school .
the other __value1__ % are called failures at __quant1__ and sent to an underfunded sink school .
why is it fair that __value1__ % of children get __value2__ % of the funding ?
grammar schools also do n't allow for children to move up if they start working harder , it 's much easier to move from the bottom set to the top set within a school than it is to move from the comprehensive to the grammar school .
everyone deserves the chance for a good education not just the lucky __value1__ % who get into the grammar school based on one exam at the age of __quant1__ .
how will __name1__ 's oil reserves of 46+ billion be divvied up ?
if not the oil atleast a decent portion of libyas future outward __name1__ .
hopefully now we 'll avoid a double dip or prolonged recession .
get that oil flowing , dammit .
long live the the __name1__ ! !
if we wanted oil contracts why would we bother with this ?
we should have just supported __name1__ and he would have rewarded our support with more oil contracts .
oh and just because there are reserves it does not mean they are financially viable , plus the __name1__ could just tell us to **** off like __name2__ did .
this is nothing more than a glorified __name1__
the __name1__ 's share of loot will be minumum , but __name2__ will make a killing its investments are safe it has avoided a long drawn out civil war .
__name1__ has won
__name1__ movement has lost
i was in __name1__ when the __name2__ was preparing its attack on [ president __name3__ of __name1__ , __year1__ ] .
his state had no revenues ; its biggest income maker was __name1__ .
so __name1__ put the tiniest of taxes on bananas ...
we installed a military dictator and there 's been nothing but bloodshed ever since." -- __name1__
history repeats it self
i do n't really know what spoils are to be had , __name1__ only produces __value1__ % of the world 's oil .
at least the end of the revolution @/@ civil war will make oil cheaper .
it 'll give political spoils to __name1__ and __name2__ , though , as long as the new government do n't cut off umpteen heads in reprisals .
unless you meant something different , __name1__ went back into profit only a few months after the __name2__ spill .
can someone explain the reason behind these riots to me ?
i 'm kinda slow , __quant1__ have n't been following the news for the past couple of days .
i log into __name1__ and am greeted by loads of threads about how it 's all kicking off in __name2__ ( and a few scuffles in __name3__ too ) but no explanation how they started then i go to the __name4__ site to try and get to the bottom of it but still no explanation !
basically , a guy got shot in __name1__ , police claim he was a gangbanger and shot a police officer , local people claim he was innocent .
initial tests reveal he did n't fire a bullet .
anyways , this killing led to a riot in __name1__ and people realised they could just break down shop windows and take what they want , and burn cars without being held accountable .
so soon enough it spread to all over __name1__ ... and now __name2__
so you 're saying there is no reason ?
they just wanted a riot for riot 's sake ?
basically , a man called mark duggan was shot to death on thursday reportedly by police , a bunch of people staged a peaceful protest and from that people have started using violence , looting and setting buildings on fire , and it 's getting worse because they 're realising that police can n't do anything about it .
the papers have it all wrong .
i live right in the middle of this crap , and i know of the sort of people who 're getting involved , and it really just boils down to some entitled pricks who 've realised that the police won't stop them from nicking things they want if they do it simultaneously , morality be damned .
that incident might have been the spark , but believe me on this , mate , there is no cause behind it anymore .
people are just taking things because they can .
most of the trouble around __name1__ is copy cat violence of what happened in __name2__ where a __quant1__ year old was shot by the police sparking of a protest which gott out of control .
people saw the looting going on and wanted some themselves therefore organising a riot .
so , anyone from __name1__ ?
riot police , police dogs and police helicopters confirmed .
sounds like the old college , the old __name1__ and a car or 2 are on fire .
many other shops attacked including __name1__ , __name2__ and a couple on kings walk .
bad times
i work in __name1__ and apparently it hasnt even been touched it was just the old college and barton street and __name2__ .
ive heard that more is going on tonight though in the main town but we 'll just have to see , really pathetic though makes me so angry .
really sad it 's hit __name1__ but i 'm not that surprised .
hopefully these idiots will get bored soon enough and there will not be any more damage done !
__name1__ is burning and the media are not broadcasting anything about it .
__name1__ is going mental with reports of bomb threats , mass looting , fires etc.
this website is updating every couple of minutes ....
__name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , __name5__ ..... all being looted ... all being set on fire .
a massive __name2__ in __name3__ has just been set alight ( from __name1__ ) .... this is mental !
edit : people were throwing petrol bombs from bridges onto passing cars on the __name1__ earlier ....
have the police enforced a compulsory media blackout ? ??
the news is being purposely hidden from the world ( to discourage further riots ? ) .
ive just emailed all the big news agencies making them aware that we know they are hiding this ......
doubt i 'll get a reply , or anything will change on the news .
i think in the middle of all this carnage , everybody needs to take a step back and just hug the internet .
the only omniscient thing i 'm aware that exists .
i was just watching __name1__ and the riots are all they were talking about for the past __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ minutes .
this is completely unjustifiable .
any sympathy the general public had for the man whose death supposedly spurred on this onslaught of violence is surely being eroded by the minute when thugs are smashing up the businesses , cars and homes of innocent people who had nothing to do with it .
was in __name1__ for the __name2__ this afternoon , got violent at 5 o clock or so , very few police considering there were thousands of ppl , also hard to find __value1__ aiders why did n't the media report this earlier ! ?
they focus on shops being burnt late in the evening but not violence at a family @-@ friendly festival etc
just wondering about the economic effects of these riots ...
i do n't think that we 'll see any substantive impact in the __name2__ unless the riots do actually spread from the periphery to the __name1__ , or even the square mile itself which i consider very unlikely .
but this is going to his tourism badly .
it 's going to hit tourism really badly .
tourists are n't going to want to go to a city that 's unsafe where the police can allow mob rule in the streets for __quant1__ consecutive nights , and understandably so .
this is the message leaving our country to foreign investors : ' we , here in __name1__ , are mindless barbarians .
if you put your business here , it will not be treated with respect , it may be destroyed , clearly we do n't have the money to buy your products '.
if i were a foreign investor right now , i 'd be looking elsewhere .
it 's perhaps just the final nail in the coffin .
i 'm not his biggest critic by any means , but this is the most out of touch thing __name1__ has said so far imo .
" the whole country wants young people given the opportunity that work experience provides ."
what a misleading statement .
the country wants unemployed people to have jobs , not be forced to work for nothing .
you would have to be insanely right @-@ wing to describe anyone who thinks people should be paid for work as a __name1__ .
a lot of people on the right are opposed to the idea of what is effectively a tax @-@ payer funded subsidy to large businesses in the form of free labour .
my take it on this is that it 's a very poor solution to the __name1__ @-@ __name1__ situation hitting most young job @-@ seekers , but that it 's better than the future jobs fund and @/@ or doing nothing .
it 's not forced though , it is voluntary .
secret tip on how to avoid this ' slave labour ': when they ask if you want to do it , say no.
no it 's not .
it is if you say yes and quit before completion then you lose benefits for __quant1__ weeks ( if an __quant2__ week scheme ) .
__quant1__ issue is that the actual scheme and the administration of the scheme are not matching up .
the voluntary scheme itself is perfectly fine .
however , something has gone wrong in the way the job centre have been portraying it to some people , making it seem mandatory .
i know they think it is , and the prime minister is elected democratically .
but there is the __name1__ and it pretty much feels like a country of ' lords ' and its like we are still stuck with some middle ages traditions .
what do you think ?
yes , although i 'd like to see a change from __name1__ to proportional representation .
also , to the __name1__ , i 'm pretty sure that there are hardly any hereditary peers left in the __name2__
it absolutely is a democratic country .
we have an elected __name1__ which is sovereign .
people point to the inherited monarchy and the llife peerage as signs of not being democratic , but ignore __quant1__ significant thing :
many other democratic countries worldwide do not elected their head of state or their upper house .
for example : __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , __name5__ , __name6__ , __name7__ , __name8__ , __name9__ , __name10__ , __name11__ , __name12__ , __name13__ , __name14__ and many others do not elect the head of state .
likewise , __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , __name5__ , __name6__ and many others do not elect their upper house - at least not directly .
as long as the elected portion of the state ( i.e . the __name1__ ) has supreme power , then the democratic imperative is satisfied .
ironically , having other portions of the state elected will invite deadlock and compromise , and the democratic will of the people will be drowned out in the politicking that will go on .
the __name1__ increases democracy in the __name2__ - it 's a safeguard .
firslty the __name1__ , although it has party politics , is kept in balance so it is not as partisan as the __name2__ .
secondly it is a chamber of experts which functions in a largely advisory capacity .
thirdly these guys are lifers , which means they are able to think past the next election for the good of the country .
__value1__ have far more faith in the __name1__ as it stands than in the fptp __name2__ which leads to barracking by __quant1__ parties who are becoming increasingly differentiated only by the spelling .
[ reposting as a replacement for my last post which broke the rules by posting a video only ]
do you think it might have something to do with the fact that __value1__ % of the people of these islands do not want this mass immigration yet our government allows million from very different cultures to immigrate to these islands .
we call anyone who says this racist . the __name1__ has defined rights for indigenous peoples .
we stand up for the rights of the indigenous __name1__ , native __name2__ , __name3__ and say that __name4__ was a hero for standing up for the rights of the __name5__ people , but if someone wants to champion the rights of the __name6__ indigenous people they are either called racists , people want to have a riot against them and some people would send them to the gas chamber .
do you think the pressure of this suppression eventually gives way to these racist rants which are becoming so commonplace that __name1__ is literally filled with dozens of them .
do you think it is just a co @-@ incidence that some foul mouth racists stand up and deliver some foul mouth speech or do you think that this is symptomatic of the fact that the __name1__ people have had enough of immigration and this is the start of revolt .
black people do n't work
therefore they can n't afford cars
therefore they use the bus with the uneducated white chavs
( the __value1__ bit is a joke btw , im not a racist =[)
the rights of the __name1__ white population do n't really need championing .
the only reason one would do so would be to legitimise ostracising people from other ethnic backgrounds .
that 's why championing rights for whites is viewed with suspicion , to my mind .
we do n't get .
i 've never seen one .
where they happen they become viral videos and even make the newspapers .
you might as sensibly ask " why do we get so many dogs falling off trampolines at barbecues ? " or whatever it is that wins this week 's __quant1__ quid on you 've __name1__ .
the racist people that we have seen on such footage are generally quite poor and therefore take public transport .
they evidently are quite angry that they do n't have much money and therfore take their anger out on other races and point the blame on them ...
i 'd respect what she said if she did n't call me a "****ing foreign ****head ".
do n't agree with sending her to jail though , what happened to free speech ?
i guess being unfair neutralises having a fare
it must be the new craze sweeping the nation !
is there any evidence of a racist rant on an aeroplace yet ?
that 'd be the icing on the cake
because they are uninformed and support the __name1__ .
okay , not trolling or anything but i have a question .
why ? i understand what both the __name1__ and __name2__ want in terms of aspirations and goals , ive studied policies and many responses to them .
but from what i 've observed via __name1__ and many news sources ; the way they 're trying to achieve them , is largely violent edit : specific coverage of __name2__ , whom seem to make the headlines a little more .
aggression and hostility is obviously the worst way to go about to get these changes made .
do n't they realise it ?
i 've seen very little peaceful protests go on , which causes me to question the validity of both the __name1__ and __name2__ .
and whether they 're genuinely thinking for the better of this country or they just house people who just want a fight , that have the option to jump on the bandwagon of __name1__ politics . hence this thread .
i 'm not blaming anyone , im largely trying to remain neutral .
however , riots and fights take __quant1__ to tango and there is obviously a massive contribution from the opposing party .
but , im just trying to get a bigger picture here .
i 'd like for this to be a calm discussion and an informative thread .
for members and followers of both the __name1__ and __name2__ to come and justify their points across so , not just i , but many others can be educated properly on the intentions and the reasoning behind it all . regards .
first of all , i have no affiliation with the bnp , i find them ridiculous .
but how exactly are they violent ?
i mean , aside from the couple of mental members in the past , i have n't seen much violence coming from __name1__ members .
infact , overwhelmingly they seem to be the victims of violence and repression .
as for the __name1__ . well , the thing is , they were never set up with specific political aims .
they were set up as an angry response to radical __name2__ and __name3__ , they are a street group , not a __name1__ lobby .
sadly , some of their demo 's have been marred by violence .
but an agressive opposition , along with a biased press and press with an agenda make them out to be a lot worse than they are .
that said , they are far from good .
the majority are loutish and do n't have any great intellectual capacity , but that does n't mean you should write them off , or that you should oppose their aims .
people who do n't think the bnp are violent do n't know **** about the history of the __name1__ .
yeah they wear suits now , but in the __decade1__ s and early __decade2__ s it was n't a political ' party ', it was just a street gang that used to fight with __name1__ and commit random acts of violence and vandalism against non @-@ whites .
you can n't change that history by appearing on __name1__ .
and before anyone storms in with the negs and the ' that 's just slander where 's the evidence of this ', __name1__ is your friend , do your own research on the __name2__ vs __name3__ and the links between the bnp and the __name4__ , __name5__ , __name6__ etc etc etc
with the __name3__ vote generally being a __name2__ vote ( __quant1__ of __quant2__ seats ) would losing scotland give the __name1__ party a clear advantage ?
the __name1__ would lose __quant1__ mp , were as __name2__ would lose __quant2__ mp 's .
although __name2__ would of still won in __year1__ without __name3__ , the __name1__ would of had a __quant1__ seat majority in the last general election .
as well as this the forthcoming boundary changes will see __name1__ lose __quant1__ seats compared to __quant2__ for the __name2__ , not to mention union donation caps that would decrease party funding for labour .
with all the said , and with conservatives likely to hold a natural majority if __name2__ gain independence , would that cause __name3__ to push further to the right in order to try and steal the __name1__ vote and effectively leave behind the working class ?
personally i do n't think they 'd have much choice .
i am interested in hearing peoples opinions on this .
unsure tbh , maybe would make the __name1__ slightly more right wing but can n't imagen it becoming majorly right .
__name1__ won a majority of the vote ( but not a majority of the seats , hmm ) in __name2__ in __year1__ and no doubt many more elections where __name3__ won in the __name4__ .
__name1__ are in between .
i wonder how __name1__ would vote if the unionists chose between liblabcon rather then __name2__
what i find worrying is that you think it is ok for a political party to change its core values and ideals , purely for the sake of gaining power .
not because they believe in what they are saying .
i 'm not saying that it does n't happen already , but you seem to be implying that it is a totally understandable thing to do ?
unless i 've misunderstood what you are saying ?
anyway , my personal opinion is that __name1__ are n't truly left wing and the __name2__ definitely are n't right wing .
they are as bad as each other .
as a ' right wing ' person (*cringe*) , i sympathise more with some __name1__ policies but i do n't really like their leadership .
on the other hand , i detest __name1__ with a passion .
good riddance if they loose their foothold in __name1__ politics .
stealing the jobs traditionally done by teenagers . absolutely disgusting .
immigration does need to reflect surplus jobs available .
however , you get people like that girl suing the government for making her work in poundland not making things better for anyone .
whilst in some cases this is true half the time these people do the work the rest of the __name1__ refuse to do ...
persay street cleaners as a prime example i cant remember the last time i saw a brit doing it yet people whine about the ' evil foreigners taking our jobs '
if they wouldnt be so anally retentive in what they wished to do .
and on the broader issue thats what you get for joining the __name1__ you win some you loose some , simple .
basically with all this fuss about scottish independence in the news i 'm wondering how this bears for people who are n't __value1__ % ' pure blooded __name1__ ' for __quant1__ generations or something .
i dunno why but it just boggles my brain .
if the __name2__ get their way and crown __name3__ as king of his own private domain , who determines who is and is n't __name1__ ?
__name1__ work and residency rights no longer apply following independence , and i can see this potential event doing nothing but fuelling xenophobia , racism and nasty nationalism .
many __name1__ people have __name2__ relatives or relatives living in scotland long term , many __name2__ move down to england , marry english people or have __name1__ relatives .
who decides if they 're __name1__ or not ?
people who have lived in __name1__ for __quant1__ could potentially find themselves aliens in their own homes , potentially considered foreign or ' not quite native '.
what about people who consider themselves __name1__ living in a british territory suddenly find themselves on the ' wrong ' side of the border ?
it seems absurd that they should suddenly consider __name1__ as somehow ' foreign '.
residents of other __name1__ countries would suddenly find themselves without eu protections either .
why is the __name1__ so obsessed with independence when there is no real political or economic mandate for it ?
surely it has to be for more than some infantile kneejerk obsession with the brave @-@ heart movie and a unjustified grievance with highly slanted views on history ?
__name1__ gains nothing but gets lumped with stupid debt and political fallout , loss of influence and still economically and culturally tied to the rest of the __name2__ as to make an international border seem utterly insane .
the __name1__ themselves are an amalgamation of different peoples , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , __name5__ and even __name6__ @-@ __name6__ .
it 's ironic that some __name2__ take issue with the __name1__ while ignoring that scotland was created in much the same fashion .
so __name2__ , who decides what a scot in a ' free ' __name1__ is ?
someone that has a heritage that clearly shows that the family have been in __name1__ for a long time they are scottish obviously although i am sure that someone born there would also be considered scottish as well ?
the only people who are not scottish would be those who move there à la not born there or have any previous family who were born in scotland .
as for who decides that could be tricky although i doubt it will be much of an issue .
i do n't see the situation being any different to the relationship between the __name1__ and __name2__ .
it would n't really matter if someone is a __name1__ citizen or a __name2__ citizen , because they will have equal rights in both countries .
right now __name1__ citizens can freely live in the __name2__ and can vote in general elections and even run for office .
i 'm sure the same thing would happen with __name1__ .
it does still raise the question of exactly who can get __name1__ citizenship , but it won't really make any practical difference to people who do n't qualify for it .
__name1__ citizenship would probably be open to people living in scotland on the day it becomes independent , and anyone who has at least one grandparent who was born there , or something like that .
look at __name1__ citizenship laws , it would probably end up being quite similar .
its an interesting question .
i was born in __name2__ to parents who were born and raised in __name3__ , but then my mothers side ( she 's an __name1__ ) has a long history of scottish ancestry .
i lived there till i was __quant1__ , but have lived the rest of my life in __name1__ .
am i a __name1__ ?
i imagine i will be able to apply for __name1__ citizenship , but will i be able to vote in a referendum ?
i doubt it .
in recent times and quite a bit more in the past it has always been heavily played on that uk prisoners are some if the most expensive people to keep in the __name1__ .
so i was thinking , why are n't we making the people who have the ability to pay ( ie @- those people who have any sort of savings or credits ) to stay in prison ?
some prisoners are in prison with large amounts of money in the bank so why are n't we taking money back off of these people to cover the costs involved in keeping them and court costs ?
if people commit the crime people should be willing to do the time and the people who can afford it , should pay for it surely ?
what are other peoples views ?
yeah man totally agree man they should register to a student loan alternative man and then like , sort of pay it off after their time in jail innit , i 'm gonna buy the domain __value1__ now before anybody else smart steals it
the law should treat everyone equally - you can n't have some people paying and others not .
i agree with you that those that can should be able to pay .
however this also raises the issue that since they are paying money as well as serving their time in jail , their sentence should be reduced .
if this were to happen , would it not be unfair that other prisoners that do not have the means to pay and have committed ' lesser ' crimes have to serve longer than those that can ' buy ' their way out of jail , so to speak ?
taking __name2__ as an example , the immigrant population has ten times the level of infection of the other __value1__ % of the __name1__ .
the other diseases are even more extremely biased .
what are your thoughts on this situation ?
personally i think it 's a very good thing , since our __name1__ should be working to treat all of the world 's sick people and the more diseased immigrants we have , the more good it can do for them .
also , having them living among us massively increases the risk of infection for the general population , making for a fair society .
why should we get to enjoy relatively low risk of serious infections when other parts of the world are in great danger of them ?
testing immigrants as a condition of entry to the __name1__ would set us back decades and is morally wrong anyway .
their health status is none of our business .
yeah it is something that we should keep an eye on but what about people without medical record ?
what do we do with them quarantine them while we wait on test results ?
i 'm surprised that we do n't do this anyway .
surely , as a matter of common sense , if we get plenty of people from countries where diseases like __name1__ and __name2__ are rife , it 's best to test for it and treat them upon arrival ?
both to prevent them spreading it to the rest of the population and also for the welfare of the affected immigrants .
how is that an infringement on human rights ... ?
coming to the __name1__ is a choice .
we already impose conditions on entry , why would one more be wrong ?
the problem is that you 'd have to pay to deport immigrants who fail the tests when they refuse to leave of their own accord .
so , i 've been reading about __name1__ independence and i do n't think it 's fair to solely concentrate on scottish independence and i 'd like to get the overall views of __name2__ members .
simple choice , either independence for your home country or to retain membership of the __name1__ .
on the one hand , the union gives us a bigger economy and population , and if it broke up we 'd be less powerful .
on the other hand it 's a good way to get rid of __quant1__ __name1__ voters and let the predominantly __name3__ __name2__ free itself of __name4__ 's __name5__ yoke .
so i 'm not really bothered either way .
so i disagree with the whole __name1__ ethos , and can n't stand what they 're doing to this country out of sheer idealogy blahblahblah ...
but the reason i really can n't stand __name1__ and his current cabinet is that they are constantly trying to pull the wool over the publics eyes .
whether it 's by saying all those in the public sector who will be striking on wednesday are selfish , or by __name1__ selflessly wiping the vat on the __name2__ @-@ __name2__ charity single , conveniently being named live on __name2__ infront on millions of viewers .
they ripped __name1__ apart on the immigration issue in the general election , now look at the mess its in ! !
does anyone care ?
here 's a link explaining the situation as some of you " righties " are oblivious to the situation .
food prices @/@ petrol prices are sky high .
when petrol costs rose when __name1__ were in government , there was a media frenzy .
likewise when services had to shut down after __quant1__ day because of snow , the media launched a full blown attack and everyday people were saying how disgusting it was .
when it snowed under the __name1__ and services shut for up to __quant1__ week , noone cared .
likewise noone was particularly fussed when __name1__ blamed the rubbish economy " growth " on the snow @/@ royal wedding .
imagine the furore __name1__ had said such a stupidly false thing .
sneaky __name1__ shake @-@ ups .
if any of you have even used the __name1__ and have lived @/@ travelled abroad for a period of time , you will probably know how lucky we are to have such an amazing health service .
there was absolutely no need to open it up to private firms , and he swore blind in those televised debates that his party would n't touch our __name1__ .
what a crock .
youth unemployment the highest its ever been .
it 's been almost __quant1__ months since the coalition has been in now , not __quant2__ months as one of you said , or just __quant3__ months as another one of you said
so blaming __name1__ for the world recession ( which by the way would have been even worse had the __name2__ been in gov in the same years ) almost __quant1__ months on where our economy has gone backwards in terms of economic growth from when labour left office , is ridiculous .
how many more years are you going to use it as an excuse for what is essentially a __name1__ government dismantling the public sector while it can get away with it .
public sector workers being singled out to pay more into their pension funds ...
my sister is a primary school teacher and teachers generally hate the __name1__ , before all this pension business came to the surface but because they 're so backward when it comes to education .
she has to pay out of her own wages for all her teaching activites @/@ reading books/teaching supplies and only has a teaching assistant twice __quant1__ week now because they 've withdrawn so much money from the school budget .
she 's a great teacher so buys all that stuff , whereas a lot of teachers might not bother as to be fair why should they have to spend __quant1__ __quant2__ year ? !
teaching standards are going to fall massively over the next few years .
why won't the people of this country wake up and stop allowing __name1__ to brainwash them ? ??
you need not to tell us why , as we already know .
we are like this because of financial issues out of our control and the mess of the last government .
if only __name1__ was doing it out of ideology !
i would like a small public sector in this country .
government spending is actually increasing .
you can hardly call the __name1__ shake up sneaky .
public sector pensions will still be much better than private .
how dare we bring public sector pensions more into line with the private sector ?
just who do we think we are ?
please , the average life span is ever increasing , it 's put the contributions up , the pensio value down , or work longer .
there are no other choices , the public sector have been spared this by __quant1__ years of spineless __name1__ government , but the fact is we cannot take this burden on at the expense of the tax payer any longer .
most of those problems you just described are the result of a floundering __name1__ government who let spending go out of control and allowed the __name2__ to disintegrate .
whilst i agree that __name1__ and the __name2__ are n't doing everything they said they would , they are trying to cut back the welfare state and dismantle some of the ridiculous laws that stop businesses and workers from operating at their highest
also , petrol prices are the result of numerous international economic factors and __name1__ price control , the __name2__ government cannot control that .
__name1__ trying to win brownie points from other clueless students who hate the __name2__ just because .
and failing .
badly .
possibly because there 's no money to do anything anymore .
why ? because the wonderful __name1__ pissed away __quant1__ on trying to create a client state .
absolutely there are problems in immigration .
this comes the same week that reports ( costing the taxpayer millions ) are finally published , having been commissioned by __name1__ , but never released due to their findings which basically concluded that __name1__ made the worst mistakes imaginable on immigration .
food prices are generally not the domain of the government , and the food prices in the __name1__ are relatively low compared to continental __name2__ - certainly the __name3__ .
been to __name1__ recently ?
£4 for a packet of butter , anyone ?
fuel duty has been relatively slow to change since the general election .
when __name1__ came to power in __year1__ , you could buy petrol at the pump for 49.9p per litre .
when they left , it was over £1.30 .
__name1__ could n't do enough __name2__ reorganisation .
have you seen what an __name1__ executive earns ?
how about a doctor or nurse that does n't actually have any patients ?
there are a lot of them working for health quangoes set up by __name1__ .
very true .
there is a recession on , and the country was on it 's knees thanks to rocket scientist __name1__ .
damn right .
why should n't they ?
why should they be the only people to have gold @-@ plated pensions with no detriment to anyone except the tax payer ?
what about private sector pensions - they 're generally worthless .
why ? because they were raped by __name1__ .
at a stroke , by taxing dividends he destroyed private pensions , costing countless __quant1__ , but benefiting the treasury a few __quant2__ which he whizzed away on social engineering .
no one believes that . __name1__ is part of a coalition government , and faces widespread opposition from the likes of you , and hard @-@ liners in his own party .
i would suggest also that large numbers of people in __name1__ are also resigned to the fact that the country had its back broken during the tenure of __name2__ and __name3__ .
except __name1__ explained exactly why they hate the __name2__ ...
nah i 'd go for sensible people with a realist outlook myself .
why would you call anybody " scum " for holding a moderate political view ?
does that post really constitute anything worth replying to , any well thought and argued points ?
it is just the same politically illiterate ramblings you hear from any __name2__ hating band wagoners , this should be left for the columns of __name1__ magazine rather than a debate forum .
a study have found there are twice as many mixed race people than reported in the census .
around __value1__ % of __name1__ people are mixed race .
coupled with mass immigration , established immigrants having children , and white flight .
the white __name1__ will all to soon dissapear , just another lost race in the pages of a history book .
__name1__ defended his immigration policies a couple of months back and __quant1__ have to say i agree with him .
i 've always viewed immigration 's goal was to try change __name1__ 's demographics and making it a fairer society in the long run .
imo we have become a more mulitcultural nation , and and an ethnically richer diverse one at that which was necessary .
changing the demographics is important for __name1__ , it 's important for a lot of nations .
to those anti @-@ immigrant nationalists who hate this , look at __name1__ , probably one of the most popular human beings of all time , if not the most popular ever .
a lot of people like him for his charisma , his charm , his looks , his speeches even , i and many others also like him for his ethnicity ( sorry but i do it 's healthy for the world ) .
__name1__ 's mixed race background highlights humanities love for mixed race people and our destiny to wanting to become mixed race .
there is no doubt this is the way the world is going .
and __name1__ as a figure head and his popularity proves that .
stunning president .
so __name1__ was right about immigration , and we are becoming more diverse thankfully , like __name2__ , because of it .
and maybe one day too we will have our own __name1__ .
viva la difference .
thank you __name1__ .
where __name1__ and his government got it wrong was in underestimating the number who would migrate from the new countries in the __name2__ , and not then providing the resources to support this , for example in __name3__ language support in schools .
for non @-@ eu migrants and those seeking to live in the country , the support and resources to enable decisions on their future to be made in a short period of time .
depends on if you believe __name1__ did it for electoral reasons or not .
immigration is good for a society , but opening the floodgates like he did is quite frankly dangerous .
op spend __quant1__ year in __name1__ and tell us all of this .
besides , it 's funny how you talk about __name1__ like it 's improved lately .
it 's going down the toilet ........... even more so by the day .
also , in reality , it 's not mixed at all .
i promise you that __name1__ is an anomaly .
most of __name2__ is about as mixed race as __name1__ .
you mostly get concentrated ghettos with black people and then entire states full of white people .
__name1__ is n't representative of anything .
as for __name1__ , he only welcomed all these new people because not him nor his mates have to live with them .
what do they care if you get new peckhams @/@ __name1__ in other places ?
i think immigration levels are high , and our past pm 's like __name1__ think that talking about high immigration is bigoted .
i have to say i disagree .
my father comes from an immigrant background , and i dont think am bigoted for wanting to see lower immigration levels .
i also think its stupid that our european friends can immigrate to britian and seek benefits , and denying them that would be against " human rights "....according to the __name1__ .
am i racist and bigoted for these views ?
no , saying that immigration levels are high is an observation and wanting lower immigration levels is what many people want
everybody knows the rate of immigration is too high but it 's not really what you say , just how you say it .
your beliefs do n't stem from believing your race is superior , or that immigrants or other races are inferior , but ' your racism ' is arguable in regards to prejudice , discrimination and antagonism ( also part of racism ) .
not saying that you are , i am saying that is open to question and has grounds depending on how you go about these beliefs .
for example , if you made an unjust distinction of someone because they are an immigrant , not quite sure if that would make you a fully fledged racist , but it certainly would be discrimination .
basically there is a thin line .
sucks but life is sometimes politically correct , but you have to learn to deal with it because you never know when you 're the one going to be on the other side of the spectrum .
ok , so i am still learning about how the free market/ global energy supply system works so please correct me if i am wrong , but here is my suggestion ;
all state services including social housing , libraries , hospitals , schools , prisons etc should be powered by __name1__ energy only and everything the state uses ( construction materials , food etc ) should be british produced , grown and maintained by a __name1__ workforce .
alongside this , we open up the private sector to imports and freedom of choice , luxuries etc.
the private sector can do pretty much whatever it wants but the state must be able to support itself with or without the boom and bust of the private sector .
people who choose to live on benefits ( rely on the state ) will only have access to __name1__ resources also .
( __name1__ grown ) food will be provided for survival as will housing and energy but ( imported ) luxuries will not be available to those dependent on the state .
if people desire luxury , then they must work for it .
the idea being that the state pays ( modest ) salaries for its workers who consume __name1__ energy ( retrieving this money through taxes from british workers ) and __name1__ food/ materials .
this would effectively create a system which circulated resources within the country rather than it being channelled out into the hands of __name1__ billionaires .
the energy will be supplied through wind turbines positioned offshore around the __name1__ which are maintained by idle military personnel .
further , a production workforce will be employed by the state in factories to produce said materials .
edit : why is everyone negging me ?
i 'm trying to offer a solution to a problem .
and this will be paid for with what ?
so no library books from non @-@ british authors ?
i think that demonstrates how quickly this idea is a fail .
also not too sure why you do n't think pensioners should be allowed to buy themselves a bottle of champagne for their __value1__ th birthday party either .
that sounds like an awful lot of government intervention .
your ideas are crazy and would mean the death of the free market .
you have to let the free market work .
and then consider the burden on the tax payer ....
the market should decide ,
if the people want __name1__ goods they will buy __name1__ goods .
if they want foreign goods they will buy those instead ,
it certainly is n't in the states interest to increase costs substantially by going exclusively for __name1__ goods of all kinds ,
they should go for the cheapest best quality goods instead .
this is not a dictatorship .
you cannot force suppliers to sell products for no profit
( they would simply move abroad where they can sell __value1__ % of their product at a profit ) .
thorium is a viable nuclear alternative and one which frankly we should already be adopting .
there are aspects of self reliance which would be good but on the whole protectionism is not a good long term policy to follow .
i 've really never understood this mentality .
here 's the crucial fact : we import more from other __name1__ member states than we export to them .
any tariffs they impose would hurt __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ and __name4__ businesses more than it would hurt us .
the __name1__ is fundamentally committed ( this is stated in __quant1__ of its treaties __quant1__ believe ) to fostering good relations and free trade with non @-@ members , especially those which maintain high standards of human rights and democracy ( now ain't that ironic ) .
so if we left the __name2__ , we could negotiate free trade agreements individually with the union and its members ; we could join @/@ remain in the eec ; or we could join the __name1__ ( eec @-@ lite ) .
we 'd have a range of options , all of which would keep our trade with __name1__ strong and healthy .
will politicians in __name1__ and __name2__ want to stop brits from buying up their countries ' bmws , mercs , audis , vws , peugeots , renaults , and so on ?
i very highly doubt it - not a vote @-@ winner .
as well as maintaining our trade levels , if we left the __name1__ we could save the several __quant1__ pounds we donate to the eu each year , reduce immigration to more viable levels , and shun some of the more overbearing aspects of eu bureaucracy , all of which would benefit our economy substantially .
oh , and __quant1__ forgot to mention that it 's predicted that the __name1__ 's share of world trade and prosperity is going to massively decline over the coming __quant1__ .
so why is everyone terrified of leaving because of trade ?
the __name1__ probably deflects as much trade as it creates .
because we are part of the __name1__ we trade more with members of the eu , such as __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , __name5__ , __name6__ , __name7__ and __name8__ because we have a common market .
however what this means is that we trade less with nations like __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ and __name5__ .
i am not convinced we want to attatch ourselves to the overly indebted nations of __name1__ .
i would rather trade with the up and coming emerging economies .
however as part of the __name1__ you do get the appreciable benefit of free trade within the eu area .
however it is starting to look like the members of the monetary union are going to try and exploit the common market member ones eg . the __name1__ .
in the very long run i think being outside of __name1__ and trading with the emerging economies , which will eventually become the big economies , is wiser .
i agree with the europhiles that it 's important to trade and work together so the people of __name3__ can collectively raise their standard of living , it 's just that the __name2__ has proven to be a corrupt power hungry entity that has a __name1__ doctrine at it 's core so it 's not an ideal long term trading partner .
it 'd be like relying on the __name1__ to provide you with economic stability .
i need reasons for why drugs should not be legalised , any help please ?
i 'm for drug legalisation .
the government has absolutely no right to say what i can and can n't do with my body , as well as what i put in it .
we should be helping those who use drugs , not punishing them .
you could make the point that by making drugs legal and creating potentially a bigger market for their use that food crops could be replaced in developing countries for drug crops much like the increase of demand for bio fuel has done , thus increasing food prices making impoverished people even poorer and increasing inflation of food products which are bad for most consumers so drugs actually have a massive impact on none drug users !
the problem with both of us is that neither of us specified which drugs we are talking about .
some drugs such as heroin are clearly awful - i certainly hope that you agree it is addictive and does harm others .
some drugs have much less of a negative effect on the individual and other people around them .
cannabis being mentally addictive is still addiction .
the addiction may very well be weaker .
i agree , the government should help drug addicts .
i believe that drug addicts should be forced to enrol on some sort of a program which is created to help them whether that would be in prison or otherwise .
( i also believe that smoking should be banned )
i think we 're all for legalizing drugs until you meet the poor guys @/@ gals who are n't from middle class @/@ higher class families and can n't afford rehab ( this coming from a lower @-@ middle class guy ) who are sleeping on the streets in the winter in the snow before eventually dying .
drugs are n't good and are n't necessary , and ruin tons of peoples lives .
i have used drugs in the past and will probably do so sometime in the future , but it should n't be legalized .
everybody seems to forget about you know , the large amount of money spent in hospitals treating drug users .
besides this , saying the government should n't tell us what to do , well i hate every single politician , but using that arguement just makes people sound like children .
perhaps reform , with more punishment on drug dealers would be good .
if you want to get philosophical , i will tell you what i believe to be the most detrimental effect of any recreational drug .
recreational drugs cause euphoria .
hence , drugs are an artificial substitute for a natural incentive that has evolved to motivate our species to do what necessary for it 's survival .
there are natural states in which humans can experience these sensations .
we come with built in mechanisms which produce these affects when appropriate .
this is ultimately why your body may produce some version of these chemicals naturally .
these chemical reactions are usually triggered by behaviors which are positive in terms of species propagation .
an example of such behaviors would be accomplishing a task , or making a personal connection with another .
recreational drugs are a waste because it is counter productive to nature , to society , and to your personal growth to have access to undeserved bliss .
if we were capable of producing a drug which induced intense euphoria , with no side effects , no adverse health risks , and was infinitely available , it would be catastrophic to our society .
it is easy for drug users to delude themselves into believing that the health risks are minimal when they are partying and having so much fun .
the biggest delusion of all is the one that most overlook .
we are not naturally meant to feel that good without achieving something to improve our existence .
i already know the kinds of responses i 'm going to get to this thread , almost by definition , because as far as i can tell you can split the __name1__ public into __quant1__ groups when it comes to scottish independence ; a majority who do n't care above some vague notion that __name2__ probably costs them money , and a very vocal swivel eyed unionist minority for whom scottish independence marks the beginning of the end of their pseudo @-@ colonial ambitions .
so i want to ask that crowd , and i already know they are going to be chomping at the bit to just click reply already , but i specifically want to know what it is you want out of the __name1__ ; i do n't want to hear about how __name2__ would be worse off somehow etc. etc. just why you want the __name3__ to remain the __name3__ and not split .
does it actually boil down to anything other than a perceived loss of prestige , the final nail in the coffin of __name1__ ?
i 'm english .
i think it would be nice if we stayed unionised and strong .
but really , if __name1__ really wants out , then let them **** off , because the whole point in such a union ( imo ) is that it 's voluntary and agreeable to all parties .
__name1__ should remain as part of the union .
it serves nobody to break up __quant1__ of the world 's oldest nation states .
all of the __name1__ 's gripes can be solved by greater localisation - not by a pointless break up .
as for ' __name1__ people ' - the attitude generally seems to be one of ' let the scots decide , but i would be sad to see the __name2__ dismantled .'
personally , i think it 's best to let the __name1__ have their independence within __quant1__ years , but before such plans are published we should drill for all the oil they have and use it to pay off our debts .
after that if there are any remaining debts they should be given around 1 @/@ 3 of it .
as i was writing a post in another topic earlier about __name1__ and their right to be a superpower , my mind rambled a bit and i started to wonder if __name2__ can ever become a political superpower on the international stage again .
__quant1__ years ago , the __name1__ was accountable for approximately __value1__ % of the entire worlds population , and __name2__ had control of __value2__ % of the worlds landmass , therefore being able to completely dictate trade routes and international relations .
a lot has changed in __quant1__ years , clearly .
in __year1__ , __name1__ britian controls very little in the way of overseas territories , and have a population of only __quant1__ residents , many having moved into the uk from other countries .
we also seem to be losing the ability to defend ourselves politically , being subservient to the __name1__ in their quest to capture resources , and being a part of the __name2__ , often have to accept group decisions that the country does not agree with or benefit from in any way .
so , with all this in mind , can __name1__ ever become a superpower again if desired ?
i know that we clearly will never compete with __name1__ in terms of population , but is there any way to maximise the economic power of the nation in order to compete in terms of financial position and ability to develop and expand faster and more sustainably than other nations ?
also , what would be the positives and negatives for the general population if it ever were to happen ?
you could make a case for the __name1__ being a financial superpower , we punch way above our weight politically and we have one of the best trained militaries in the world .
yet superpower in the old sense of the word , basically being a colonial or military superpower , is something i think is out of our reach for very obvious and in my opinion desirable reasons .
the best way the __name1__ can stay on the world stage is doing what it does now , being pretty much the top in the service industries .
the __name1__ was probably the greatest the world has ever known .
it was also one of the most brutal and morally abhorrent .
i think monopolistic power tends to corrupt and is almost invariably abused .
anyway , we are a stable , wealthy country .
why do you care , ian ?
i hope this is n't some jingoist nonsense .
the fact is , it is n't going to happen .
yes it can .
whether it does become one remains to be seen .
the next superpowers will be those who win the energy war .
that is those who develop the best and most efficient renewable @/@ readily accessible power source and are completely self sufficient on it .
possibly creating a surplus .
in all honesty , i really see the __name1__ being the next world super power in the next __quant1__ years .
i mean we are getting closer and closer to becoming a single ' state '.
i mean most of __name1__ has the same currency , laws and you do n't need a visa to travel between each country .
the numerous train operating companies in __name1__ make our rail system confusing .
they encourage high fares so that they can make profit , but do very little to invest in the network ultimatly leaving __name1__ with the highest rail fares in __name2__ with one of the poorest services .
meanwhile , in other __name1__ countries such as __name2__ and __name3__ , the rail network is nationalised .
they benefit from low fares and quaility services composed of many ' high speed ' routes .
privatisation in __name1__ was supposed to encourage competition and therefore drive drown fares but i do n't see how competition on the railways works as each company usually has a monopoly on the route they serve
( eg . if you want to go from __name2__ to __name3__ you can only use the __name1__ )
so , do you think that we should re @-@ nationalise the railways and base the network on the __name1__ @-@ __name2__ model of low fares and high quality ? i certainly do !
we can n't afford it right now .
anyway if we had the money yes . not this idiotic subsidized monopoly
what happened to that company that walked away from __quant1__ of it 's franchises a couple years back ?
i remember the government ( __name1__ i think ) said it was going to be punished , did anything ever happen ?
financially it may not be viable at present , but nationalisation ought to be a long term aim .
privatising the railways was arguably the worst thing the __name1__ did .
in the meantime we need more regulation , especially with regards to fares , which are disgracefully high .
i support deregulation , and i am completely opposed to nationalisation .
in a time of economic downturn , you want to nationalise the rail network so the public sector ( who is already faced with __quant1__ of pounds worth of cuts ) has to finance the entire network , including maintenance , investment and subsidies ? no thanks !
deregulation or privatisation ftw ..... or even just how it is right now .... our rail network is n't that bad to be brutally honest ,
it gets you from a to b , sure there might be a few delays before you get to c , but you 'll get there in the end
... and the __name1__ are hopping mad over it !
how long can __name1__ keep smoothing the ruffled feathers of his party ?
will this be the straw that breaks the coalition 's back ?
__name1__ claims a lot of things .
it was n't really a __name1__ victory , the general population was wholly against it from the beginning .
__name1__ should stick to weeping to __name2__ .
so we 've all been hearing a lot about super @-@ injunctions being littered all over the news , although one thing has struck me , that applies in almost all other __name1__ countries apart from us : the defendant is always anonymous until proven guilty .
i think that until the defendant is proven to be guilty , they should be completely anonymous , to prevent false arrests getting out into public and denting one 's reputation , as it is almost a form of defamation .
i do n't think it 's fair that cases are so publicized , and should only be so open if the defendant does n't mind .
it is weird how people proven to be innocent are still hated because of the accused crime , like the stigma of being called a paedophile even though it can literally happen to anyone and everyone .
would help if the media made a big thing about them being innocent , but most people are stupid generally , else this problem would not exist .
if you look at that __name1__ case , everyone had decided that landlord was guilty up to the point where people hated him and the media was slaughtering him .
turns out he was innocent .
not that the media owed him an apology or anything
__name1__ or __name2__ ?
supporters of each claim that the other will benefit " x @-@ treemists like da __name1__ ", but they can n't both be right .
can we find out here which voting system will benefit ( increase the power enjoyed by ) small , " extreme " parties like the __name1__ and __name2__ , with an explanation ?
do n't vote for __name1__ because you think it will help __quant1__ party more than another .
vote for __name1__ because you think it will be more fair . if __name2__ results in __quant1__ __name4__ __name3__ , because more people in our country support the bnp , i think that 's fair enough .
we live in a democracy after all , people should be allowed to vote for who they like and everyone 's vote should count .
honestly i hate these freaking ' vote __name1__ and the tories won't get in ! ' arguments , they 're so idiotic and not even true .
__name1__ peoples @- who else here thinks we should use the single transferable vote as our electoral system ?
for those of you who do n't know what it is , i think __name2__ is the main truly proportional system of electing __name1__ .
candidates are numbered similar to __name1__ , but constituencies are multi @-@ member so seats are allocated based on numbers of votes .
it 's the system used in __name1__ elections .
i 'm one of the few __name1__ __name2__ who thinks we should use it , but what do you think ?
__name1__ would be my ideal electoral system .
the whole constituency link issue would be less important if we had more localised politics .
i was sympathetic to __name1__ , but then it seems that in the recent __name3__ elections it 's just as vulnerable to disproportionalities as __name2__ ...
__name1__ is far and above the most fair system in my opinion .
representative + constituency link maintained .
what more could you ask for !
invade __name1__ .
think about it , what does __name1__ have that there is a potentially lucrative demand for ?
the answer , a well trained and heavily equipped military , which although short on numbers at the moment , could easily be bolstered in a very short period of time .
the __name1__ rebels are crying out for assistance in overthrowing __name2__ , so i say we make them an offer .
we 'll send an army of __quant1__ troops to take __name1__ , and in return they will provide us with a promise of a fee - say , __value1__ % of all __name2__ oil revenue for the next __quant2__ years .
so not only will the invasion create __name1__ jobs , take people off the streets , provide invaluable battle @-@ field experience and be self @-@ financing .... it could actually be profit making !
a __quant1__ % stake of all __name1__ oil revenue over the next __quant3__ years could be worth __quant2__ of pounds .
it 's just a shame that with __name1__ and the __name2__ in a position of power , this left @-@ wing @/@ anti @-@ military coalition would never go for it .
__name1__ and such __name2__ companies are already in __name3__ and have been for __quant1__ .
drastic action like you suggest will just form a beacon for all extremeists in __name1__ to come to __name2__ to kill __name3__ citizens
__quant1__ troops there 's barely that many soldiers and officers in the entire army , most of whom are not frontline but rather logistics , intelligence , engineering personnel and so forth .
you 'd have to start giving sailors and aircrew rifles and combat gear .
we are doing enough as it is in __name1__ , anything further we can do must be humanitarian ( supplying medical and food supplies to __name2__ , for example ) or logistical ( supplying training and weapons to the rebels in __name3__ so they stop sucking )
op i think you underestimate how long it would take to train and equip __quant1__ soldiers then all the logistics and other such things that an army would need .
if you are going to do it well i 'd say at least __quant1__ to __quant2__ years .
especially if you are doing it to the standard of the __name1__ army .
i 'm not insulting politicians here ; i 'm defending them for once .
i always feel that people are impossible to please when it comes to how politicians appear in public .
take the tv debates for example : everyone hated __name1__ 's " down with the people " and " i met a black man the other day..." act , but at the same time , had he remained aloof and failed to engage with anyone , he would have aggravated another group of people , and been called a toff even more .
another example is that recent departure lounge picture , which everyone decried as a fake .
again , it 's a lose lose situation : some say it was staged publicity , which is bad ; others say it was genuine , but the whole holiday was a pathetic attempt to pretend that " we 're all in it together "; others still would doubtless complain if __name1__ flew off __value1__ class to a __quant1__ star resort instead of using __name2__ to go to some __quant2__ star place in __name3__ ( or wherever it was ) .
this is n't unique to the __name1__ , those were just the examples which sprang to mind .
sometimes i find satire a bit annoying , because it means that politicians can never seem to do anything right .
i wish people would keep the debate on policies and ability @/@ desire to deliver them , not who 's a toff or who 's flying which airline or holidaying in which place , or using certain mannerisms to respond to questions .
just my random ranting __quant1__ cents .
yep , i feel extremely sympathetic to politicans .
i know quite a few personally and almost all of them are actually , dispite the hype , really good people !
they get held to a higher standard than almost anyone else , seem loathed for doing a very , very tough job and often for doing what people claim they want them to do ...
well , you know , __quant2__ doubt whether some of these " hard working " politicians would last very long if they had to work on a building site carrying bricks or steel gurders for __quant1__ hours __quant2__ day , or even work a __time1__ @-@ 5 carrying heavy frozen meat produce from __quant4__ cage to another __quant3__ days __quant4__ week .
i 'm sick and tired of this wishy washy social justice nonsense that the lib dems are inflicting on __name1__ 's government .
what the country needs is a __name1__ government .
a proper __name2__ government that will not be afraid to stand up for free markets , hard work , britishness , __name1__ and our military .
i hope to __name3__ the av referendum returns a big fat no so that this horrid left wing coalition can be returned to the dust and we can finally get on with real , __name1__ leadership ( thanks to __name2__ , of course ) .
what has __name1__ got to do with having a __name2__ government ?
the problem for the __name1__ is n't the electoral system its that they do n't have enough widespread support in the electorate .
we had __name1__ last time , the country was on its knees and we had had __quant1__ years of __name2__ government , with labour 's popularity at rock bottom .
but still __name2__ __name1__ did n't have enough support to get a majority under fptp .
now the __name1__ are facing the unpopularity of government and __name2__ are ahead on the opinion polls .
the lib dem vote will collapse but i bet more of their vote goes to __name1__ @/@ __name2__ than it does the __name3__ .
i think the __name1__ was a broadly __name2__ nation up till the __decade1__ s but since then it has turned against them , they had their lowest ever days in the mid @-@ late __decade2__ s and early __decade3__ s , even since they 've had an upturn on the back of a __name3__ government running into problems , they 've not been able to build a broad base of support in the country like __name4__ or __name5__ did .
the __name2__ did n't get a majority because __name1__ fixed the boundries .
__name1__ got a majority in __year1__ with 9.6 million votes but the __name2__ come short in __year2__ despite having 1.1 million more votes than this .
some analyst reckon the __name1__ needed just another 15,000 votes to get that majority .
i would have voted based on what i thought was best for the country .
if i honestly thought __name1__ could solve the problem , despite all my problems with them , i would have voted __name1__ .
but that is n't the case .
but a lot of __name1__ voters i know/ have met , have told me that they vote labour because ' __name2__ only care about the rich '.
and that is it , you ask them why they think that and .... nothing .
or another common reason ' __name1__ will take away ema and give the moeny to the rich '.
well yes , they took away ema , but ema was a stupid system anyway , unfair and put in place by the __name1__ government to try and make unemployment figures look better .
most __name1__ voters i know in real life voted for them either out of ignorance and views inherited from their parents/peers .
or because they wanted their pocket directly lined .
now , i know this is n't the case for all __name2__ voters , hell there are some intelligent ones on __name1__ , who vote for labour for decent reasons , and though i disagree i respect them for that .
i just feel that __name1__ get a lot of votes from the reverse @-@ snob working class in areas like mine .
so they can quite literally do anything , and people will still vote for them over the __name1__ .
i 'm fairly right wing , but i do n't think a full on __name1__ government is what anyone wants .
this is a centrist country and the government should reflect that .
i 'd like it if we elected very socially liberal governments all the time ( to the point of legalising and taxing all narcotics ) , but i know that won't happen .
i 'd like withdrawl from the __name1__ , but that won't happen .
politics in most democratic countries does usually hover around the centre .
apart from the __name1__ , but that 's a cultural thing really .
as a __name1__ supporter , i disagree with the cuts that the __name2__ are currently making .
they are going too far , too fast .
their policy of contractionary fiscal policy creates a substantial risk of the __name1__ slipping back into recession , which means consumer confidence will begin to fall even further , as people will be more likely to save , which leads to less money being pumped into the economy , ie . a fall in aggregate demand .
with current levels of unemployment very high , job losses will be the consequence of these harsh , unnecessary cuts through the __name1__ 's contractionary fiscal policy .
on the other hand , __name1__ 's policy of expansionary fiscal policy means that although the budget deficit will increase , a significant number of jobs will be created , aggregate demand will increase , which means an increase in consumer confidence , therefore household income will increase , which may result in taxpayers moving into a higher tax band , which leads to an increase in government revenue from taxation .
if we carry on with the current rate of cuts , we will reverse to the __decade1__ 's , making the poorest poorer , and the richest richer , same old __name1__ !
cuts need to be made at a steady pace , with the budget deficit dealt with once the economy is full steam ahead .
all views , opinions and thoughts are more than welcome
definately pro @-@ cuts , even though the wife lost her job , she still agrees with the cuts , it 's for the good of the country as a whole
pro cuts for me to because if you invest in the public sector like __name1__ would it means your getting growth based on debt which doesnt work then we 'll eventually have the same problem again and run out of other peoples money to spend .
the only way you can have growth is by private investment .
i 'm not against the cuts per se .
i 'm just against the reforms that are going to cost as much to implement as they save and are done for ideological rather than financial reasons .
cuts are more or less inevitable , even if i do n't necessarily agree with what , when , where , how and why .
it makes me cringe that the government are cutting funding for the __name1__ people , and yet somehow fund the military to rain clusters of bombs over foreign people !
to be honest as much as everyone dislikes them i do n't see any other political parties putting forward a decent proposal
this country literally has no money and is in huge amounts of debt
i 'm against the increase in uni fees though , on the whole __quant1__ do realise that university fees do have to increase , but trebling them within the space of __quant1__ year is far too much
i apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread , but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter .
i 'm a __name2__ __name1__ , born and brought up in __name3__ , however i would say i am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side .
recently __quant1__ watched a documentary by __name2__ ' __name1__ ', made a few years ago , yet a very interesting watch .
i have been on holiday to __name1__ a fair amount of times , and have traveled throughout the country , so i thought i had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it 's people .
however , after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on __name1__ i am absolutely shocked .
i may be wrong when i say this , but was pakistan not founded as a __name1__ state , yet only __quant1__ years on and i do n't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with .
it seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting __name1__ culture , in a sense it boosts their superiority complex .
i actually find it shocking , that most families who moved to __name1__ in the 60 's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in __name2__ .
drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally i find it quite upsetting , it seems as if __name1__ is moving in the opposite direction @- the rich becoming more obsessed with __name2__ culture and the less well off being neglected further .
also whilst i 'm on this topic , has anyone seen the film ' __name1__ ' and what were your views ?
thank for reading my thoughts !
liberalization is moving in the opposite direction ?
personally , any nation 's judiciary system that is in anyway influenced by objective morality scriptures and superstition has no place in the __century1__ st century .
while i can understand your sentiment that is undesirable for tradition to be dismantled , ever since the fall of the wall in __year1__ , liberal democratic values have spread ( __name1__ , __name2__ , __year2__ ) and that does not preclude ( just yet ) the sovereign states whom are conformed to __name3__ teachings as their rule of law .
__name1__ culture gives people individuality and lets them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberties they desire ( as long as it does n't harm anybody else ) .
i think it is the right direction that __name2__ culture ( unforced ) is spreading , it gives a common ground for different cultures to interact , promotes tolerance and allows people to pick their own way of life .
i do n't see that being a problem .
and that 's a bad thing why ?
westernisation = progress .
imitating the most developed countries in the world is n't really a bad thing .
__name1__ was founded on the basis that __name2__ felt their interests would not be guarded by a __name3__ government , not as some spiritual muslim homeland .
as it is , i 'd hardly say __name2__ is ' __name1__ ', what with it 's blasphemy laws , it 's constant conflict with __name3__ , conservative populace , tacit funding and support for various islamist organisations .
i think rather than worrying about the populace , worry about yourself .
who are you to judge people if they wish to drink alcohol , or watch western tv ?
also , as you bemoan the __name1__ . it 's worth remembering you would n't have had a country without us
i simply do n't get why __name1__ is such a huge threat .
they are merely retaliating to whatever our politicians throw at them !
" if __name1__ changes course , abandons its nuclear weapons ambitions , and lives up to its international obligations , it will be welcomed back into the community of nations."...
as a weak country with no big weapons to defend its people..
yeh right , they 're so on board with that !
all the huge countries that are bullying __name1__ into submission right now with sanctions and what not have nuclear weapons ?
how on earth is this fair ?
all the sanctions is affecting ordinary iranians !
soaring food prices/ fuel ...
why is the world doing nothing ? !
do we want __name1__ to become the next __name2__ ?
this is totally unacceptable !
not to mention the meddling we have been doing inside __name1__ for the past __quant1__ years or so ... installing the shah.. overthrowing democratic governments ...
hey __name2__ , how about you assassinate some more __name1__ scientists ?
absolutely degrading behaviour by the __name1__ , no wonder they hate us !
because they have a pretty crazy guy at the head of their goverment - who 's developing nuclear weapons .
not to mention the grudge they have against the __name1__ .
they have a bad history of blowing things @/@ people they dont like up ...
negs , quaint ... are you all disputing irans known history of terrorism or are you all morons ?
because __name1__ is a maniac .
what kind of history do the __name1__ have then ?
dont remember __name1__ starting a war the last..lets say __quant1__ years ?
that was a tongue in cheek remark i wasnt being entirely serious .
largely rhetoric to lay the groundwork to get support for the war .
this was n't done properly before going to war in __name1__ and we had people opposed to it from the start , also going in with mixed messages ' its about wmd and a bit about regime change ' looked bad when there were n't any wmd there .
so we need to go in from the start saying with __name1__ it 's about regime change , __name2__ is bad , he does n't respect womens rights or whatever otherwise you will have the same situation if we say its about nuclear weapons and then go to war and do n't find any nuclear weapons .
i can understand the argument that nuclear proliferation is bad and any of these states having nuclear weapons is not desirable as it just leads to proliferation in the region , but that argument should have been used against __name1__ and __name2__ getting nukes .
people say __name1__ having nukes is a risk because terrorists might be able to get hold of nuclear material ...
well hello ... __name1__ has them .
remember when we went in to take out __name2__ we could n't tell the __name1__ government for fear that bin laden would have been tipped off and escaped ...
that hardly fills me with confidence that they should be allowed to have nuclear weapons .
the problem with these ' resolutions ' targeting __name1__ is that everyone can see the hypocrisy , its a case of our allies can have nukes but others can n't .
a much better resolution would have been a hard resolution on non proliferation and disarmament in the region , which meant __name1__ and __name2__ had to disarm and __name3__ had to disarm , and any moves by any country in the region towards getting nuclear weapons would be met by international air strikes .
i could definitely support that as a non proliferation treaty .
i 've heard stories of __name1__ , indians , bengalis , filipinos , __name2__ and __name3__ with __name4__ roots being racially abused in places like __name5__ , __name6__ , __name7__ and so on ...
are you a non @-@ arab minority living in the middle @-@ east , or do you know someone who did ?
do you feel that the problem of racism is a big or a small one in comparison to places like __name1__ ( the southern states in particular )?
it 's not so much racist , as it is ' classist '.
people from __name1__ , __name2__ , and so on often work as maids , drivers , etc. in the __name3__ .
they do n't abuse you because you 're a certain skin color , they abuse you because they think you 're some servant that barely makes any money and should be grateful for being there .
yes , there is racism in some __name1__ countries in the __name2__ .
if you are from __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ or any country that is n't very rich then you are mostly treated like crap .
however , if you are __name1__ , or from the __name2__ or any other rich __name3__ country then they treat you really well .
__name1__ in particular are treated badly , there are indian maids and they are often hit by the house wife if they for example make a small mistake or sometimes they are hit with no reason .
i have relatives who live in one of those rich __name1__ countries and as far as i know they told me that some of them whilst at school have experienced racisms from children for example one of them a girl was called black and ugly and that her hair is bad but the teachers do n't do anything about it , they are racist themselves .
i have to admit i am really quite worried about russia..
in the mainstream media and popular consciousness the big doomsday scenarios mainly centre around __name1__ and __name2__ , obviously both of those are grossly misrepresented , the idea of a __name3__ @-@ __name4__ war for example is objectively absurd and no serious commentators pay it any attention , it 's really just a propaganda tool and an exciting subject for video games .
the situation in iran has the ability to cause a lot of misery in the __name2__ but again , iranian leaders are really quite self aware , they know what they are doing , and there is near enough no risk to the world at large even if they do acquire nuclear weapons of them actually using them , although we as simple peasants obviously need to believe that and go along with our governments because if __name1__ does become a nuclear power then it will have a lot more independence and influence in the region and that obviously can n't be tolerated .
anyway , __name1__ , it seems to me , is the real potential doomsday scenario here .
almost all the conditions of wiemar __name1__ are present ; economic downturn , unemployment , a recent history of loss of empire , rising nationalism and xenophobia .
and just like __name2__ there is a hard turn to the far right by the country 's middle classes and the rise of egomaniacal leaders who are already undermining what little democracy there has been in __name1__ .
there are even __name1__ youth leagues harassing opponents above the law .
you have the ultra nationalist and deeply racist __name1__ tribes , highly militant , extremely aggressive and becoming more and more mobilised , convinced that the time has come for mother __name2__ and that x , y and z ethnic/religion/political groups are responsible for the loss of russia 's glory and therefore must be eliminated .
just like __name1__ was , russia still is a major military power , a nuclear one , and with enormous economic potential .
honestly when you think about it it really does look just.. terrifying .
am i missing something here ?
can anyone explain further or recommend some reading ?
yes , __name1__ does have huge problems with __name2__ @-@ __name2__ ideology ( which is kind of ironic given the history of russia ) .
it 's military is pretty brutal as well - see __name1__ .
__name1__ regularly interferes in it 's neighbours ( such as the __name2__ and the invasion of __name3__ when it became too __name4__ ) , but i do n't think it has much power beyond that , that is n't to say that they would n't if they could .
but they are hemmed in by __name1__ , __name2__ and the __name3__ .
there is a lot of bitterness about how ex @-@ __name1__ states have become part of ' the __name2__ ' ( like poland and estonia for example ) .
what specifically are you concerned about ?
it is n't going to invade __name1__ again if that 's what you are concerned about .
i mean they helped the invasion of __name1__ and __name2__ asked to join __name3__ .
their closest " __name3__ " allies are __name1__ and __name2__ ( and they are close ) .
__name1__ is n't really that close to any major powers .
i disagree with this , at least not without huge structural changes .
it has terrible future demographics ( with no available fix through immigration ) and is totally dependent on exporting oil and gas - as well as being run by corrupt oligarchs ( who make __name1__ corporatism look non @-@ corrupt and benevolent ) .
i think __name1__ is pretty neutral about most international affairs now , so i do n't see the big worry .
__name1__ has been reduced to nothing but a peripheral country that condemns whatever resolution the __name2__ puts forward .
the __name1__ government is pretty bad , but their opposition is worse .
the leader of the __value1__ largest party in __name2__ , the __name1__ , wants __name2__ to be " re @-@ stalinised ".
the __value1__ largest party , the __name1__ , is pretty nutty too .
first off , a disclaimer of sorts , these are my opinions based on news reports and a little research around the topic so i apologise if my facts are wrong or inaccurate .
like the title says i welcome thoughts either on my opinion , or on the matter in question .
anyone who follows the news will have heard in amidst all the " __name3__ crisis " there is an issue growing between the __name1__ and the __name2__ .
specifically __name1__ and its attempt at a nuclear program , where iran hopes to gain nuclear power for peaceful purposes ( __name1__ 's statement ) .
the __name1__ and __name2__ however believe that __name3__ are using this nuclear program to develop and obtain nuclear weapons claiming they have " information suggesting iran had carried out tests relevant to the development of a nuclear explosive device ".
due to this the __name1__ and __name2__ have imposed sanctions on __name3__ involving limits on the oil bought from iran which in turn decreases their economy and other sanctions of similar consequences .
right now that that 's done i can state my opinion , please correct anything i have put that is wrong !
my opinion in short is this , the __name1__ and __name2__ have no right to impose sanctions on __name3__ and to deter their nuclear program .
however , i am very opposed to __name1__ gaining nuclear weapons and threatening ww3 and in fact i am opposed to any country having nuclear weapons .
the only argument the __name1__ and __name2__ have is that __name3__ is not a stable country at the moment and a unstable country should n't be able to kill millions at the touch of a button .
however for them to tell another country what they can n't have , when they have nuclear weapons themselves is nothing except hypocrisy .
from __name1__ 's point of view , one could argue that our governments are unstable with new leaders every __quant1__ years with differing opinions and views .
what right do we have to dictate what another country can and cannot do .
i think that 's the essence of my argument , and i accept that the " __name1__ instability " is a big part of the sanctions .
thank you for reading and i hope i 'm not completely ignorant here !
why do countries not have a right to tell others what to do ?
people tell each other what to do all day every day , why should countries be exempt ?
of course , __name1__ has every right to say " no ", but then those other countries have every right to refuse to trade with them .
though i do n't believe we should have nuclear weapons either - it 's not hypocritical as such .
having a new leader every __quant1__ years does n't make a country unstable ( otherwise irans single leader would be highly stable ) .
most countries who have nuclear weapons now can be trusted not to abuse them - __name1__ cannot .
regardless , i personally do n't think world security should be held back just because someone is worried about being a bit hypocritical .
i believe that the only reason why __name1__ gun sights have been trained on __name2__ is because of their decision to switch from petro @-@ dollars ( american ) to the gold standard or something similar .
this would would have a detrimental effect on the __name1__ economy , or practically any economy that relies on the dollar as a currency and as a result , the already weak american economy would lose it 's leading place .
all the other aspects , nuclear power and oppressive regimes are just a side issue .
this was demonstrated time and time again when __name1__ switched to euros in __year1__ and __name2__ wanted to switch to the gold standard before he was toppled .
the __name1__ also wanted something similar and i do n't know what happened to that .
there is still no evidence against __name1__ .
the __name1__ have been in many times .
all we have is suspicions .
also the __name1__ publishing the names of all __name2__ nuclear scientists is rather sinister .
they very well knew this is like gold dust to __name1__ and __name2__ ie assassination targets . impartiality ?
i think not .
the hypocrisy argument gets nowhere , but most fail to understand the double standards suggest an ulterior motive , at the least a lack in credibility of the __name1__ .
__name1__ has illegally obtained and continues to have a nuclear arsenal , not to mention the innumerable __name2__ violations against it 's neighbours , yet it is metaphorically scot free to do as it pleases .
it 's like they are playing __name1__ : the political leadership of __name2__ / __name3__ and __name4__ seem to me more likely to " go all in " rather than back down and fold or negotiate .
i think it 's a while off yet .
__name1__ is having a decent time trading with the __name2__ , and trying to stick __quant1__ fingers up to the __name3__ .
neither side want 's to jepordise their economic security by engaging in what will be a costly and deadly military action .
i think the only problems will come if and when iran stop allowing nuclear inspections , or when the un/nato/the __name1__ decide that there is a high probability that iran are near realisation of weaponised nulcear material .
i personally find __name1__ 's behaviour at the __name2__ this week to be absolutely disgusting .
apparently they 're threatening to veto a resolution on __name1__ if it does not explicitly rule out foreign military intervention .
the text has already been ' watered down ' to omit the demand that __name1__ step down , yet again to appease the __name2__ .
every day nearly 100 innocent civilians are being massacred by the __name2__ government in __name1__ ( at a far quicker rate than those __name3__ who have died at the hands of __name4__ ) .
but where are the demonstrations ?
where are the ' blood for oil ' and ' victory to the intifada ' morons ?
where are the hysterical students comparing __name1__ to __name2__ and __name3__ to an __name4__ commandant ?
where are the __name1__ flags being displayed next to swastikas ?
where is __name1__ 's film condemning these indiscriminate murders ?
where 's the public outcry about __name1__ veto and unilateralism ( a criticism routinely employed - rightly - against the __name2__ when it vetoes resolutions on __name3__ aggression )?
so many have been killed that the __name1__ has given up trying to count casualties , and yet we have a clique of barbarians and mafia crooks in __name2__ holding the world hostage over this issue .
__name1__ is renovating a military base in __name2__ , has arms deals worth billions , infrastructure and energy deals .
__name1__ oil , gas and steel companies have substantial interests in __name2__ including an __name3__ gas pipeline , gas processing plant , deal with national syrian oil company and oil exploration there .
__name1__ wants stability and a friendly regime to ensure the security of their interests , so they back __name2__ .
that 's __name1__ for you .
nevertheless , __name1__ would be lucky if he survived this year .
it 's a similar situation to __name1__ .
the rebels need help with the big military targets , but when it comes to ground operations , they are more than capable of handling the situation .
if you wish to understand __name1__ 's reasoning , know its national interest .
in this case arms contracts worth $ __quant1__ is a national interest .
no way are they going to let that go down the drain if they can do something about it .
nor are they willing to lose face by openly supporting the __name1__ regime .
they will just exercise their __name1__ privileges and keep sneaking the promised weapons into __name2__ __quant1__ way or the other and keep cashing in on the opportunity .
personally , i do n't think they would start ww3 if __name1__ is attacked , because they have more to lose , and they 'd probably just do things like supply weapons etc...
any one else have an opinion on this ?
if ww3 does break out , we know we can go to __name1__ or __name2__
good to see __name1__ backing the __name2__ .
whilst i think the prospect of ww3 is a slight bit of over kill the __name1__ do have a point in that the __name2__ is in no position to meddle in iranian affairs least of all at this stage
__name1__ hey dude , sup
__name1__ hows it goin bro
__name1__ yeh just u no how u like killin your own peeps just like i do ?
__name1__ yeh lol
__name1__ lets like hang out together n attack ppl who try to stop us killin our peeps
__name1__ sure thing bro
__name1__ would eventually lose .
anyone , watching any of the gop __name1__ presidential debates , as you can see the media pathetic effort for pretending that __name2__ does n't exist .
__name1__ is right on every level but the mainstream media does not want him to get as much talk time as other puppets such as __name2__ santo rum and __name3__
i 'm in .
he is amazing , the only person who can take the __name1__ forward .
however , he appears to be losing steam as a result of the timing of __name1__ and __name2__ .
do you realise that __name1__ would disapprove of the video in your sig vehemently ?
probably , but then due to the fact it 's got more space , the __name1__ does n't have the same problem with __name3__ as __name2__ does .
also , the __name1__ 's biggest problem at the moment is an economic one .
people are saying this everywhere now and the consequences are unknow .
could this really happen ?
only if __name1__ doesnt become president then there will be war .
the __name1__ has n't the capacity to commit to a full @-@ scale war with __name2__ at present if one keeps in mind its quite significant pre @-@ existing commitments , the state of the economy , and the strength of iran 's defensive capability - targeted strike( s ) seems more likely , or perhaps greater action by __name3__ , but i doubt that .
why is the __name1__ allowing __name2__ and her __quant1__ children to remain in the uk ?
i know she was born and raised in __name1__ , but do you think that the __name2__ is as anti @-@ __name3__ as it claims ?
__quant1__ word , __quant2__ letters , __quant3__ vowels , __quant4__ consonant .
oil
but there are sanctions on oil exports ?
i know this sounds too nice but it 's maybe because a persons family should not suffer for the ' crimes ' of an individual .
she 's __name1__ i think .
we 've been hearing a lot in the news about __name1__ and its threats to shut the straight __name2__ , and how __name3__ countries ( e.g . the __name5__ , the __name5__ and __name4__ ) , but how are the countries around the straight reacting to the threat ?
as i cant seem to find anything on how countries such as __name1__ , __name2__ the __name3__ are reacting .
wild speculation is welcome here
this is backwards .
it 's not a threat , it 's a response to the threats of others , e.g " attack us and we 'll close the __name1__ ".
there is nothing for other countries to respond to .
they are the would @-@ be aggressors .
unfortunately most tsr'rs are too brainwashed to see that .
just so stupid .
__name1__ 's the only one with the balls to stand up to israel/usa .
if they fall due to the surrounding countries going against them , then they 'll continue remaining sheeps and it won't be long till they 're toppled themselves .
i support __name1__ 's arming up though , as i do for all __name2__ nations , weapons may be useful in future .
the __name2__ only exists in part because of __name1__ .
__name1__ sold almost __quant1__ $ of arms to the __name3__ republic during the __name2__ @-@ __name4__ war and provided loads of military aid ( this was while israel was apparently a supposed sworn enemy ) , training and even helpfully removed iraq 's nuclear capacity in __name5__ ; where if __name6__ had developed nuclear weaponry he would have undoubtedly used against iran .
did you know that there was a camp just outside __name4__ of __name1__ tacticians aiding __name2__ and co against __name3__ for the whole of the conflict with iraq ?
the islamic republic owes an awful lot to __name1__ - it enabled it to survive against __name2__ and continue the war with __name3__ ( by continuing the war this enabled it to solidify it 's position by killing thousands and thousands of __name4__ democrats and other members of the opposition - as well as terrorising the population ) .
do n't forget that __name1__ supported __name2__ when they invaded __name3__ and __name4__ as well .
these are the facts :
in the west , it is threatened by __name1__ , in which __name2__ forces are still present
in the east , __name1__ has at least 100,000 __name2__ troops alone
south @-@ east , __name1__ which has nuclear arms , corrupt officials and is a __name2__ ally
all around are __name1__ countries with friendly ties to the __name2__ who keep rallying for the ' head to be cut off the snake '
north @-@ west , __name1__ , __name2__ ally
north @-@ east contains refuelling stations for __name1__ millitary vehicles in __name2__
who is really being threatened here ?
sorry to inform you : that is exactly why we would go to war __value1__
as nice as it would be for countries like the __name2__ and the __name2__ to be over there to help , the truth is we would n't interfere if it was n't for the oil and other economic and political gains .
if they do restrict the straight it will will cause a massive decrease in the amount of oil to the west ( __value1__ % of imported oil comes from the straight according to a figure i saw on the news ) , and our economy would greatly suffer ...
we would in that situation definitely cause a big commotion .
i highly doubt there would be a ww3 , but i do know for certain that the big countries and supper powers would go to __name1__ due to globalisation and economic links .
in __name1__ the poor quality of local broadcaster 's international news seems to have completely baffled the general population as to exactly what is going on , the coverage is utterly appealing to be honest and regularly confuses their nuclear programs and their attempts to blockade the __name2__ homuz .
politically the general gist of things is that the current __name4__ government is stuck between sucking up to the __name5__ and therefore getting embroiled in any potential conflict ( __name1__ is presently off __name2__ under __name3__ command and could get drafted in should military action commence ) and the fact that the __name6__ now have control over them through their control of the __name7__ and their single __name8__ seat ( hung parliaments for you ) and of course are very anti @-@ war , anti @-@ nato and anti @-@ anzus .
the ultimate result will be down to who is prime minister when such a situation occurs , according to the unions they intend to fire __name1__ next month and replace her with __name2__ yet again who is extremely pro @-@ __name3__ and less aligned with the __name4__ although he will probably suck up to __name5__ as well .
the opposition will attempt to counter any potential for entering the war with statements such as " they 'll be __name1__ boatpeople " causing national panic and further hatred of innocent refugees potentially leading to an early election and a coalition ( __name2__ @-@ __name3__ ) government being formed who will support the war to a degree but otherwise will be to focused on __name4__ which is the main aim of their entire foreign policy .
over these past __quant1__ years , i have noticed an increasing amount of anti @-@ __name1__ news reports which have culminated in the recent attacks on the __name3__ __name2__ with both countries expelling our respective diplomats .
it now seems certain to me that within the next decade the __name1__ and __name2__ among others will be involved in a fully fledged war against __name3__ .
throughout history , the expelling of diplomats has usually meant one thing and when this is coupled with the __name1__ alongside general unrest for a long period in __name2__ , it seems inevitable we are heading towards another war .
as a general question , i would like to ask others to see what you think ?
are we going to war , what can we do to avoid this and just in general for people to air their opinions on another war in the __name1__ .
p.s. just to clarify i am neither anti nor pro war , this is just a launch pad for a discussion .
given the __name1__ mentality i would say we will see them strike __name2__ .
would't be shocked if they used nukes either tbh
that is a big claim ,
it would quite an amazing escalation if __name1__ used nuclear bombs on __name2__ .
i know , however __name1__ is going to know that if they strike __name2__ will hit back .
conventional weapons may not even be able to hit some of the fortified facilities either .
the idea of a single debilitating strike on __name1__ that will stop it ever being able to strike back is going to be very very tempting for __name2__ .
and depending on which way the __name2__ election goes american support may not be forthcoming if someone like __name1__ gets elected
if they have @/@ get nukes , no one 's invading __name1__ .
i personally think it would be cool , __name1__ might have to think twice before carrying out major bombings in palastine etc.
there will always be that deterrant if __name1__ gets nukes .
of course not but the question is fast becoming not will __name1__ strike but when and how .
a conventional strike on __name1__ is going to raise massive geopolitical consequences too . including huge damage to the world economy and the possible destruction of __name2__ .
bit of a novice at economics but i was wondering , after __name3__ jong @-@ __name3__ 's death why are the stock markets in __name1__ @/@ __name2__ falling ;
are they anticipating something ? thanks
this will hopefully herald the end of __name1__ as we know it as people will realise that it is doomed to fail .
just leads to insecurity in markets
you look at koreas neighbours __name2__ , __name3__ etc all major players in the world economy .
im sure some dirty bankers have vested interests also .
but whose to say it was __name1__ bringing down the markets .
with the primaries quickly approaching i thought it would be a good idea to have a thread on everything related to the __year1__ election .
who do people think will be the __name1__ nominee ?
who do you think has the best chance of beating __name1__ ?
for me it seems that it is going to come down to a two @-@ way race for the nomination between __name1__ and __name2__ .
i can n't see any of the others getting the nomination .
__name1__ probably has a better chance than __name3__ of beating __name2__ .
there is now a poll .
if you do n't think any of the candidates can beat __name1__ then that goes under ' other '.
i personally would like to see __name1__ be the nominee , but backmouth probably has better chance of becoming a tsr mod than this happening .
the republicans will probably go with __name2__ over __name1__ .
it is a shame that scandal has hit __name1__ because he had promise .
i am an independent voter and my opinion is that who ever the __name1__ nominee is , they probably won't be willing to do what 's necessary for the u.s. economy if elected .
if __name1__ is reelected he definitely won't be willing to do what 's necessary for the economy .
i hope most other independents feel the same .
i 'd be happy with anyone but __name1__ who wants nothing less than our economy 's complete demise and is clearly anti @-@ __name2__ .
what does everybody think about the possibility of going to war with __name1__ ?
the __name1__ are making moves encouraging a very likely chance of war !
do you think it will happen ?
do you think it should happen ? discuss ...
mark my words . no other country will attack __name2__ except for __name1__ , with perhaps military support in terms of intelligence from the us/uk .
the __name1__ does not have the means to carry out an attack on __name2__ . -
forget the fact that the us/uk/nato would never get the support from the international community to carry out an attack .
israel ? they can do what they want .
what are people views on the current __name1__ occupation of __name2__ .
should it be freed from their imperialist grip etc....?
what do you 's think of the current armed struggle ?
was the war involving the ira and inla a success or a failure ?
and what are your views on those trying to establish a __name1__ republic in __name2__ ( not the __name3__ 's )?
i really do n't think anyone in __name1__ cares much about __name2__ .
i do n't think many people really understand why you insist on murdering each other either .
__name1__ needs to overcome its grip of alcohol .
first , __name1__ no longer occupies the southen __quant1__ states .
the idea of an armed struggle is preposterous , even to strong nationalists the idea of free healthcare , a stronger economy and less corrupt politics makes war even more ridiculous .
currently those in the ira are terrorists fighting a pointless war they 'll never win .
__name1__ is in itself a fair theory for government , yet no country has established a socialist republic that is superior to the current democracy
the law of return gives __name1__ people and those who half jewish on their mother 's side the right to become __name2__ citizens .
this is a ridiculous sexist and racist law that nations around the world should oppose .
__name1__ is now refusing to give aid to countries who discriminate against gays , we must now do the same to sexist and racist nations .
a number of states world wide have similar discrimination , however we deem __name1__ as a modernised civilized society .
__name1__ must set an example to these less developed nation by scraping this outrageous policy .
what if the government said all people of __name1__ heritage are free to become __name2__ citizens would we call them racist ?
__name2__ is a __name1__ state , specifically .
created for the __name1__ people , does n't seem that odd that if you 're jewish you 're allowed citizenship .
__name3__ is passed through the mother ( a jewish mother makes you a full blooded __name2__ , not half jewish ) that 's how judaims works .
so it 's not that sexist per se it simply follows the __name1__ laws of inheritance .
other religions are passed soley through the father , are they sexist too ?
making __name1__ is n't exactly a small step ...
and as soon as you 're a citizen if you 're under __quant1__ ( __quant2__ for women ) you will have to join the __name1__ .
i just do n't think it 's that shocking or appalling .
also , they have a very good refugee policy - they 'll take pretty much anyone who is fleeing for safety .
countries are free to make up immigration rules as they please .
it happens here in the __name1__ and around the world .
for example if my grandfather was a british citizen born in the __name1__ , who then moved and married a none british citizen , and they then had my mother outside of the u.k , my mother would still be eligible for citizenship .
however if my mother then married a non brit and gave birth to me outside of __name1__ i would no longer be eligible for citizenship as citizenship rights only extend one generation in the uk .
however if it were __name1__ instead of the __name2__ i would still be eligible for citizenship if my grandfather was irish .
so i would be irish if my grandfather was __name1__ , but i would not be __name2__ if my grandfather was __name2__ .
is this discriminatory ? yes..
but immigration laws by their very nature are discriminatory , that is their whole purpose , to discriminate who is and who is n't allowed into a country .
all nations have them and they all tend to be different ( which is normal considering different nations have different cultures , traditions and customs ) , it just so happens that in __name2__ the requirement is that your mother is @/@ was __name1__ , it is different to requirments in other countries but it is no less valid .
reading the newspaper today you may have seen an article regarding a teenager called tariq aziz .
he was part of a scheme organised to document the effect of drone strikes , he was given a camera .
on his way to his aunts house he and his __quant1__ year old cousin were slaughtered by an illegal __name1__ drone strike .
what the **** is wrong with __name1__ ?
who will go to ****ing court because of this ?
no @-@ one cos its __name1__ , and they are clearly above the law because they have money .
how the **** can __name1__ complain about __name2__ home @-@ made rockets when they 're using drones without a care in teh world ?
why does __name1__ have the right to ****ing attack anywhere its want without any accountability ?
it 's not a bloody __name1__ killstreak .
why when they kill civillians do they have the cheek , to quote __name1__ article to say ' they 're has been no collateral damage in drone attacks ' when according to the times again there are pictures of incinerated young children ?
now do you understand why many people , especially __name1__ have a gripe against the __name2__ ?
at least most __name1__ are sane , unlike the __name2__ goverment who just can n't seem to stop committing terrorist acts .
i 'm sorry for the swearing , i 'm not one to usually swear , but the __name1__ et al are a joke .
why the negs ?
the killing of this and several other innocents is okay ?
if __name1__ sent a little drone to __name2__ and did the samething , what would the ramifcations be ?
what would the outcry be like..?
op i suggest that you watch the documentary '' __name1__ '' on __name2__ and then come back to argue .
this supposed ally of the __name1__ is training and preparing innocent __name2__ children who are too young to understand __name3__ properly to go into a busy afghan bazaar to blow up innocent afghan civilians .
this is what __name1__ deserves for funding lunatic __name2__ rebels since the the __decade1__ s against any __name3__ government that has existed .
it is the price paid for the __quant1__ dead __name1__ during the __name2__ occupation and the civil war which porkistan funded .
the truth is , every time these drones hit , they kill maybe __value1__ % terrorists ( at max ) and __value2__ % civilians .
each of this civilians is a real human with real emotion , not just a statistic .
for instance , a __quant1__ year old kid sees their father blown to pieces , you expect them to love the __name1__ ?
they become radicalised and ready to murder __name1__ at any cost .
__name1__ strategically targets civilians so they have a reason to stay there due to further radicalisation of youth .
i tried to watch the program " __name1__ " but the question i kept asking was why ?
in the __value1__ __quant1__ - __quant2__ minutes they never explained why __name1__ would want to double cross .
now do n't get me wrong there will be people within the intellilgence who are double crossing and have a secret agenda .
but to the highest level as a whole why would the government want such destabilisation from all angles .
the president is corrupt and money hungry but i would say that there are plenty of easier ways for him to do that if he so pleases and putting the country into turmoil and him in a terrible light would surely be foolish .
and re the whole drone thingn i really struggle to understand how they can be justified at all .
when lots of people in __name1__ died in __year1__ they felt angry , agrieved and wwant revenge .
to do this they went on a long war resulting in thousands of deaths and also did not take regard for countries ' sovereignty .
now again a lot if not the majority of deaths are not caused by the __name1__ directly but a significantly large number are therefore it is still a valid point to raise .
i would love to know how a __name1__ citizen would react if bombs were dropped on their home towns by a foreign country .
i 'm sure they would be happy to forget it and want no justice .
you know what i love ?
all these people saying ohh , you are creating the terrorism !
well , we would n't be doing anytyhing were it not for the terrorists in the first place .
and what cause have they ?
they did n't like __name1__ foireign policy .
so instead of going to a parliment meeting , they went to armory and decided to blow **** up and kill innocents .
you want someone to blame for the deaths of civilians in __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ , look no further than __name4__ terrorists .
i think most people are looking at this , again , without an objective analysis of the situation .
ever since the intervention in __name3__ and drone attacks of __name4__ , can anyone give me a successful attack by __name1__ @-@ __name1__ on the __name2__ since the intervention ?
some people should know better that the __name1__ and her allies are not on some mission to kill innocent civilians , quite the contrary .
most of the contributions in this topic have failed to recognize that __name1__ fundamentalists have been operating in __name2__ and are the root cause of terrorism in that area .
in __year1__ , __name1__ saw __quant1__ terrorist attacks leaving __quant2__ people dead .
in __year1__ , __name1__ saw __quant1__ terrorist attacks , resulting in __quant2__ casualties .
in __year1__ , __name1__ saw __quant1__ terrorists attacks , resulting in __quant2__ casualties .
in __year1__ , __name1__ saw __quant1__ terrorist attacks , that resulted in __quant2__ fatalities .
terrorist attacks have killed over 35,000 people .
if we compare this to figure of civilian casualties ( which i will go into ) it is quite a healthy ratio as of the 1658 to 2597 killed , __quant1__ were thought to be civilians , in contrast of the __name1__ @/@ __name2__ @-@ __name2__ 's operations to kill civilians .
interestingly , the number of terror attacks in __name1__ dropped which can prove to be conclusive evidence of the effect on __name2__ @-@ __name2__ and __name3__ leadership and their effective operational capability that is decreasing .
one can logically say these drone attacks are working , which is reported on both sides if you look at the current fragmentation of __name1__ @-@ __name1__ and asscoatied jihadist sects leadership operating on the __name3__ @-@ __name2__ border .
from a strategy perspective , in __year1__ and __year2__ , air drones were equipped with new missiles called small smart weapon ( ssw ) or typically known as ' scorpion .'
these missiles have increased accuracy and expanded surveillance , including the use of small , unarmed surveillance drones to pinpoint the exact location of targets .
ever since the introduction of civilian causality countermeasure technology , __name1__ reports that __quant1__ militants were killed and only 30 civilians killed in drone attacks in mid @-@ __year1__ .
__name1__ believes that civilian casaulties have decreased from __value1__ % to an estimated __value2__ % , with a total of __quant1__ civilians killed since __month1__ __year1__ .
on the grounds of legality , according to the __name1__ , members of regular armed forces - involved in conflicts - are the only persons who may be considered lawful combatants and authorised to use lethal force .
the operators in __name2__ are the __name1__ ( usaf ) and the pakistani military .
so , who really murders more ?
__name1__ fundamentalist groups total of __quant1__ casualties ( since __year1__ ) or the __name2__ ' __quant2__ casualties ( since __year2__ )?
why can n't people think the same thing ? if it was __quant1__ __name1__ kids dad there would be media furore .
i did n't see these __quant1__ kids names on the news ?
yet we see soldiers who made a choice to go and fight on the news when they die .
actually , it does
that is the very definition of democracy , if something passes by the tiniest fraction of a percent needed then everyone and everything else can be ignored .
of course this is not how we work , but then you can n't start saying we 're undemocratic because people do n't turn out for the vote , that is their problem , not the governments .
and please don ; t get started on the coalition .
it is democratic because together they recieved more votes than __name1__ , so they have a right to power .
right , so to you there 's no difference in blowing up 100 's of civilians in a crowded market place , and blowing up a building but phoning the threat in beforehand to minimise civilian casualties ? in that case , it 's ok every , bishy just basically said collaterol damage does n't exist for any __name1__ forces as there 's no distinction between force used . let 's start bombing civilian areas , it just does n't matter apparantly and of course , i do n't condone either group , afterall , the __name2__ 's aims were only achieved after they laid down their arms .
no more than it is for someone to blow you up .
there seems to be a misconception held by some that __name1__ is not a welfare state .
does anyone know the percentage of gdp they spend on welfare and benefits of all kinds compared to say __name1__ or the scandanavian nations ?
- who are usually considered the biggest welfare states in the world .
edit :
ok , so i have had look today and it looks like __name1__ spends __value1__ % of its budget on welfare programmes .
__value1__ % if you add pensions .
look at this chart here from the us government spending website .
it has __value1__ % health , __value2__ % pensions , and __value3__ % welfare .
is that how to work it out ?
__value1__
yes , a lot of money ( read . too much money ) is spent on ss etc.
however , the taxation rates on average are still __value1__ % higher at least in european nations .
this is why we need a __name1__ government to try and decrease our ridiculous government spending .
__name1__ do nothing but spend money , and fight wars --- and encourage wars --- and spend more money trying to put americans in a constant state of fear .
__name1__ are a joke
apparently __value1__ % of americas budget is spent on __name1__ @/@ __name2__ and __name3__ which is a joke considering how naff __name4__ welfare is
suppose you got a letter that stated you must attend __quant1__ month of military training before you are sent to iran/zimbabwe/syria to protect the civilians from oppression .
it must be on ground to minimise civilian casualties .
your friends are going to protect these civilians too .
do you go or do you sacrifice your dignity ?
this is a " humanitarian " mission after all .
not going would in no way sacrifice your dignity .
what if you have __quant1__ children to feed ?
how would making the choice not to leave them alone and destitute mean you surrender your dignity .
this is nonsense .
in answer to the more general question you are trying to pose : no , i would n't .
anybody who does such work deserves all of our respect ( assuming no ulterior motive ) but it is n't for everyone , and that does n't make somebody a bad person .
i would protect my family and friends , i have no interest in personally protecting strangers ...
i 'm not here to save the world , in no way does that decision impact my dignity
in __year1__ __name1__ was the poorest country in the world , before the __name4__ intervention __name2__ enjoyed the highest standard of living in __name3__ .
in __name1__ , homes are considered a human right .
newly married couples receive $ __quant1__ to buy their own home and electricity is free for all .
im not making all this up
__name1__ vowed to house every __name2__ before his own parents , he kept his promise and his own father died before he was able to be housed .
before __name2__ , less than 1 @/@ 5 th of __name1__ were literate .
now education is free and high quality .
literacy rate is now __value1__ % .
healthcare is also free .
if libyans cannot find the education or healthcare they need in __name1__ the government unds them to go abroad to access it .
all loans are interest free by law .
if a __name1__ buys a car , the government pays __value1__ % of the price .
the price of fuel is $.14 __quant1__ gallon .
any __name1__ wishing to become a farmer is given free use of land , a home , equipment , livestock and seeds .
on __month1__ __day1__ sr __year1__ , 1.7million people assembled in __name3__ , __name4__ to show defiance against the __name1__ bombing of __name2__ .
this represented around __value1__ % of the population of __name1__ .
the __name1__ central bank is state owned and unlike banks in the west is now owned by the elite or ridden by debt .
__name1__ didnt have to drive around in __name2__ with __quant1__ inch thick glass or a tank like __name3__ does ,
search __name1__ , theres plenty of videos of him beign driven around waving and shaking hands of the dozens of people running after him .
__quant1__ years ago __name1__ leaders all over the world praised him .
yes __name1__ has been accused of some terrible things , but look at the things __name2__ leaders do all of the time .
the __value1__ he started giving out oil contracts to __name1__ @/@ __name2__ he was ousted .
disgusting .
ok , cool story , but here 's some facts :
1 . he started a war in __name1__ - a crushingly poor nation that was in the middle of a civil war at the time - with the intent of establishing a puppet __name2__ that he could control .
thankfully he failed after __name1__ , with the assistance of __name2__ , expelled his forces .
2 . he started this war in __name1__ by luring immigrants from __name2__ and poor sahelian nations to __name3__ with the promise of civilian work , and then press @-@ ganging them into fighting as the __name4__ .
many legionnaires are still a major threat to peace and stability in __name1__ today , specifically in __name2__ where they are now known as the __name3__ .
perhaps you 've heard of them ?
3 . he directly funded terrorism against the __name1__ in the form of the __name2__ , which he also trained and equipped , and sponsored other acts of international terrorism such as the __name3__ bombing .
4 . he embezzled __quant1__ of dollars of public money to fund a lavish , dictatorial lifestyle for him and his family .
5 . he illegally proliferated nuclear weapons , chemical weapons and biological weapons in flagrant violation of international law .
6 . any political dissent within __name3__ was brutally repressed by the __name1__ , directly lead by __name2__ - one of his sons , and composed of foreign mercenaries willing to do anything against the libyan people for their next payslip .
7 . __name1__ political refugees were assassinated by the state as a means to oppress the opposition to his rule .
if you have any love lost for this man you are a terrible human being .
i think he did that to keep his people happy so that people would be less likely to oppose him or he started out good genuinely wanting to help his people but became obsessed with power .
so vile .
how can a country like the __name1__ , relatively liberal and tolerant , have such a powerful party of extremists ?
__name1__ has nothing to match the __name3__ , on social issues , apart from perhaps the __name2__ - but even they do n't hate on gays as much as the __name3__ does .
in __year1__ , how can __name1__ even think of voting in such a party ?
it 's disgusting .
shame on the __name1__ .
it 's an incredibly religious country @- and a very evangelical one at that .
as much as i hate their attitude , you need to understand that it 's just the way they 've been brought up to think
that being said , it is still shocking that this type of discrimination still exists ...
the people who get involved in politics to the degree of going to debates are , thankfully , not representative of the majority of people over there .
does n't stop them being dicks , though
and ? this is surprising ?
it 's known that the __name1__ is n't as progressive as __name2__ with regards to gay rights and attitudes towards gay people .
to be fair , __name1__ is probably just a confused idiot .
he said that sex has no place in the military and orientation is irrelevant , which i agree with .
but then he said he 'd bring dadt back , which is disagree with .
but the booing of the soldier was terrible make no mistake .
if a gay soldier is better than , or just as good as a straight soldier , then it makes no difference what their sexuality is .
at the end of the day , if i was serving on the front line with other troops , i 'd want the best troops , not the straightest .
what makes me laugh is that the usual anti @-@ __name1__ crowd has jumped on this thread with all the " vile " and " disgusting " comments .
the same crowd that gets into a lather about the evil empire of __name1__ and the poor __name2__ blahblahblah .
the __name1__ has legalised gay marriage in some states , and federal equality laws . sure , some people are n't up with that - but that 's freedom for you .
contrast this with the wonders of the palestinan authority , where it is a criminal offence to be gay and punishable by imprisonment .
you hear a lot of criticism of israel - but if you had to , would you rather live there or __quant1__ of its closest neighbours ? bearing in mind __name1__ 's freedoms , prosperity , etc.
note : i know some of the countries do n't physically neighbour __name1__ , but they are extremely close so they count .
eygpt , probably because they 're comparitively level and calm . ( i said comparatively ) .
for religious , political and social freedom . __name1__
because it 's the most westernised , __name1__ .
i know a lot of __name1__ people and let me tell you , they 're the most fun loving persons i have ever met .
really open @-@ minded and peaceful .
it looks really beautiful too !
__name1__ because its the least likely country to get bombed and invaded by israel
__name1__ or __name2__ .
plus to all the people saying __name1__ , really ?
its future is very uncertain and __name1__ ( assuming some of you are ) are routinely not treated properly .
i really have no idea why -- unless you were a devout __name3__ -- you would choose __name1__ over __name2__ .
unless you have no care for any of your freedoms .
and before anyone makes any sarcy comments about __name1__ , at least a woman can drive there..
none , when i was in __name1__ the heat was too annoying , so i 'd rather not reside in that region .
__name2__ . __name1__ is a relaxed , westernised place and the party capital of the __name3__
__name1__ ... what ?
its only a little swim away i 'd call it a neighbor , lived there for __quant1__ years , lovely , go for a swim in the sea catch some rays on the saturday , then off to build a snowman on __name1__ on the sunday , great little island .
i saw the news story about the submariner who went on a killing spree on a nuclear submarine and it worried me quite a bit .
is it realistic that in the next __quant1__ years there 'll be worldwide dismantlement of all nuclear weapons intended for killing other humans ?
never hopefully .
nuclear weapons have kept the worlds superpowers from wiping each other out
the submarine was just powered by a nuclear reactor , it fires non nuclear warheads .
the day they 'll be gotten rid of is the day something more powerful is invented .
we have every reason to hope that does n't happen , tbh .
why would governments and companies in certain countries sell arms to an offensive country when they attack a country they dislike but then attack that country when it attacks a country they do like
this is double standards !
i am talking about the __name1__ before and during the __name2__ .
__name1__ attacked __name2__ then governments were happy to sell weapons to iraq including __name3__ , __name4__ , __name5__ , __name6__ , __name7__ , __name8__ and __name9__ .
some of them were even selling to both sides such as __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ .
a small minority sold only to __name4__ these were __name2__ and surprizingly __name3__ according to __name3__ ( although __name4__ denies this ) .
why would all these countries be happy for __name1__ to go on the war path and to fund both all sides of the war yet go after iraq when it starts on __name2__ ( although they left __name3__ in power ) .
my thoughts are that governments simply let their private arms companies make a bit of cash off the war like they usually do .
they used their puppet governments of the shah and __name1__ to control the countries to counter __name2__ influence in the region .
when the __name2__ revolution happened the __name1__ lost all their influence over the nation so after __name3__ began their attempted invasion they happily cast a blind eye in order to regain influence .
then when they saw __name1__ invading country they already had influence in __name2__ they finally took action although they left him in power as the __name3__ were still there and would n't want __name4__ to become __name5__ .
then __quant1__ years later there is no longer a soviet union but they notice a strengthening __name1__ that is a potential threat to their ally __name2__ so when some they get some ' evidence ' of __name3__ with nuclear material from a known unreliable source via __name4__ they jump with joy to invade it .
it is a win win for their publicity they either take out evil dictator __name1__ or they stop __name2__ getting nukes .
then they build up their bases in __name1__ and fund a new government to counter the threat of __name2__ as they lost all influence upon __name1__ when they stopped them in the __name3__ .
these wars are just ways to prevent other nations gaining any sort of power whether it is directly or indirectly as well as make their arms companies some major money on the side .
so if you still think the __name1__ and co are the just and honourable governments they claim to be why would they allow companies to fund __quant1__ sides of a war ?
why would they go to war over an ideology ?
why would they only take action when a puppet state is invaded ?
well , what are you proposing to replace it with ?
because governments change every __quant1__ years in most places and every government tends to pursue a different policy .
__name1__ sold guns to __name2__ and __name3__ helped oust him , you can n't look at it as if cameron is bound or responsible for the actions of blair
a countries actions should n't ( and luckily do n't ) depend on moral standards .
it is naive to think they should .
there are far more important political and economical reasons for military intervention or political sanctions .
i certainly do n't , they 're mostly hypocrites .
if only we could make the leaders look right into the eyes of every civilian they kill , maybe the fighting and wars would stop .
obviously i know it never will , but i can dream .
there is so much discussion these days about race , __name1__ , etc that i get the feeling there are underlying problems .
personally i feel sorry for them ( non whites and __name1__ ) as they bear the brunt of these discussions .
or are we just in denial of racial and ethnic problems in society ?
'' learn from history '' - yes , and it teaches us '' multiculturalism '' actually always fails .
i do however believe we could get along together , if we figured out how .
douchebags like this being given a forum to air their views is fanning a lot of contagious stupidity
well this is the case no matter the denial .
its funny , when __name1__ plants bombs , the first thing people say is , ' why did they do this ? ', well , fair enough , because its better to understand motives , the same applies to the growth of nationalism in __name2__ .
many factors are at play , anti white racism , immigrant crime which targets white people disproportionally , mass invasion immigration policy , abuse of immigration and welfare systems .
it is no use just blaming ' racism ' as it misses the issues .
so everyone is just getting along fine ,
regardless of race , religion , nationality and ethnicity etc ?
i do n't think that is true either
i 'm as right @-@ wing as they come , but why are the __name1__ keeping hold of islands that are not theirs ?
they are __quant1__ of miles away .
i long for the day that the islands are reunited with __name1__ and diplomatic relations between __name2__ and argentina can resume .
what are your thoughts ?
when hell freezes over .
when the __name1__ decide they want to be __name2__ .
they are quite fond of being __name1__ right now .
is this another name for the __name1__ ?
as i understand it , the inhabitants of these islands feel a strong sense of britishness , and want to continue to remain __name1__ .
the islands belong to the islanders , not __name1__ , and if the islanders say they want to be argentinian , or independent , then the islands would cease to be __name2__ .
can you not understand the difference between an individual in one country wanting to be a citizen of another ( basically a wannabe migrant ) and a state wishing to retain its territorial status ?
in your american example , that 's the difference between a dude in __name1__ saying " i want to be __name2__ - why can n't i ? " and __name3__ saying " we want to remain part of the __name4__ ".
that 's true ; the oil in the __name1__ is not a major factor .
although i do believe that if the majority of islanders wish to be __name2__ we should keep the __name1__ .
when we get __name1__ ' back '.
i mean they in no way want to be part of the __name1__ , but they 're right next to us , so they should be ...
why does the term ' __name1__ ' even exist ?
why do n't i just call __name1__ ' dickhead land '.
also , op , ignorance much ?
they already belong to the __name1__ and the __name1__ grants them local governance .
so technically they already belong to their owners .
they never were united with __name1__
the problem with this logic is there are more than enough people who think differently to cover the costs - and they ( or anyone in fact ) could n't care less what you think .
they will be paying for the defence themselves if with the oil revenue as well so there will be even less reason for you to complain in the future .
i have to write about the __name1__ involvement in current affairs for school , i must have been living under a rock for the past few months because __quant1__ have no idea at all as to what the imfs involvment with __name2__ is , ive tried to google it but all the different information is confusing me , can anyone explain please ?
they are called in when countries fail to run their economy properly .
of course eurocrats failed to see what was happening ... what do you expect from hansomly @-@ paid , non @-@ audited people resposible for other @-@ people 's money ?
like the fall of the __name1__ , the whole mess is gonna get worse .
in __month1__ __name1__ 's cpi went up by __value1__ % year @-@ on @-@ year , __value2__ % in cities and __value3__ in rural areas .
attention that the food prices went up by an astonishing __value1__ % .
this is definitely increasing the pressure on its economic growth .
everyone has his @/@ her point of view .
that 's only a percentage point higher than the __name1__ , but unlike us they have double digit economic growth so have plenty of room to work with .
i mean , if inflation is __value2__ % but the economy grows __value3__ % , that 's net wealth creation of __value1__ % is n't it ?
or is there something i 'm missing ?
even if the rate of economic growth almost doubles the rate of inflation , the effects of this high rate of inflation are still prominent ; especially due to __name1__ 's very unequal distribution of wealth .
" __value1__ % in cities and __value2__ in rural areas "
the rural areas accomodate many of the peasants in __name1__ and as it faced such high rises in food prices and a __value1__ % rise in general prices , those peasants are going to find it increasingly hard to purchase their commodities .
i am sure many of us are well aware of __name2__ 's " __name1__ " theory , that future conflict would be along cultural lines between " west ", " east " and " confucian " blocks , whatever they are .
what does everyone think ?
does the theory hold weight or is it just a product of modern day oriental @-@ ism ?
the op 's mind is moving in , in my opinion , the right direction .
conflicts are almost always caused by political and economic issues rather than cultural ones , even if motives for fighting may ostensibly appear to be over religion , for example .
if you have __name1__ access and have n't read __name2__ 's article on __name3__ , then i recommend it .
something that caught my eye today .
it seems __name1__ is proposing a ban on the cultivation and possession of a range of plants that contain certain psychoactive substances .
these are the plants that are already included in australias ban list :
- all plants in the cannabis genus
- all plants in the erythroxylum genus ( which cocaine is derived from )
- __name1__ and __name2__ ( opium poppies )
- all fungi that contain psilocin and psilocybin ( magic mushrooms )
these are the plants that would be added to the ban list :
- savia divinorum
- kratom
- khat
- brugmansia
- datura ( the former and latter both common garden flowers , but are crap as recreational drugs due to their high toxicity . idiots who try it once wont try it again , if they survive .)
- any plant that contains ephedrine
- any plant containing mescaline
- any plant containing __name1__ ( this is the one i find most absured as there are litterally 100 s if not 1000 s of plants and trees that contain this substance , many grow wild in __name2__ and are commonly used in landscaping .
__name1__ even occurs naturally in humans and most other mammals , are they going to ban humans and mammals too ! ?)
as a horticulturalist myself , i find the __name1__ authorities proposals to be highly disturbing .
this is completely pointless legislation , bureaucracy at its finest , that is going to criminalise potentially millions of innocent people who work with these plants or grow them ornamentally in their gardens .
and just how do they expect to be able to enforce a ban on litterally thousands of species of plants ?
its insanity , you cant legislate nature .
and then of course we come back to the old chesnut ; most of the substances in these proposed plants are less harmful and addictive than legal substances , such as alcohol and tobacco .
mescaline and __name1__ actually cause less harm to the body than caffeine .
anyhoo , rant over .
this article is a few months old , so __quant1__ dont know if this made it into the law books or if it was thrown out , so if anyone has any information id like to hear about it .
heres hoping common sense prevails for once .
how do they ban cannabis in __name1__ ?
dosent it grow as a .... well weed
it 's your responsibility to use drugs sensibly and your choice whether you abuse them or not .
it 's no right of the government or anyone to control what you consume .
i think the government should tackle drug use and damaged lives by providing support for those who need it , not by criminalising them .
many drug addicts get send to prison and are given methadone to ' ease ' their addictions to crack , meth or heroin .
obviously that 's wrong .
=/ that 's the harsh reality of it .
ban the substance in the __value1__ place .
it will cause damage now to those addicted but better for long term
i do see the value of rehab though
it 's the illegality of drugs that makes the production , distribution and use of those drugs hugely expensive and harmful to everyone .
most of the outlawed drugs , if taken with a bit of knowledge and awareness , are mostly as harmful , if not much less harmful , than tobacco or alcohol .
what did you think of the __value1__ __year1__ __name1__ debate on thursday ?
it featured __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , and __name5__ .
it is in the early days , so there were n't that many candidates .
and what did you think of the __name1__ version of the ‘ undeclared ’ candidate 's debate .
it featured impressions of __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , __name5__ , and of course , __name6__ played by the legendary __name7__ !
i thought it was great . pure humour .
edit : __name1__ was n't in either . hmm ....
i like __name1__ more and more
__name1__ i would support any means to protect the country . not liking the sound of that
the __name1__ one seemed to be let down by the fact that so many of the undeclared big names were n't there ( for the obvious reason that they 're undeclared ) .
__name1__ would be the lead runner of those that took part , but the __name2__ people are far more likely to be the main contenders .
that said , where was __name1__ this time in the __year1__ race ?
notwithstanding a few of his religious nutter @-@ esque social views __name2__ is the only __name1__ who actually makes sensible points about big government and the only one i have any respect for .
too bad he 's never going to be president given the state of the __name1__ party .
i just saw a similar thread on __name1__ , so i thought , why not in __name2__ as well ?
i dont need to explain the situation there ...... but shouldnt they have a revolution ?
the press is relatively free so people have a medium they can vent through .
there are too many factions that are fighting amongst each other - if they unite under a common cause then there would be a serious threat of revolution .
firstly , __name1__ was not an enemy of ours .
secondly , __name1__ is the autocrat of his country , if he wishes to stamp out rebellion , it 's his prerogative .
all states hold the right to defend their own interests .
humans are cruel , people should get over it , it 's our nature .
additionally , should n't our own armed forces be used for national defence only ?
of all of these conflicts over the past __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ years or so , which directly affected our interests :
- the __name1__
- the __value1__ __name1__ ( liberation of __name2__ )
- __name1__
- __name1__
- __name1__
- __value1__ __name1__ ( removal of __name2__ )
i would say only the __name1__ .
the __name1__ the __name2__ and to an extent the __name3__ .
i see what your saying but if we have a chance to help people fight for democracy and not be brutally crushed then we should do something .
we rarely get the chance to support rebellions as in most cases the rebels are as bad as the government they are fighting .
__name1__ can be seen as a popular uprising against a __name2__ .
no doubt people complain but they would complain if we did nothing to .
no one wants to see another __name1__ and this event seems to signify a much more proactive right foreign policy from the __name2__ .
and before people shout oil at me .
well you are just going to have to wait until after this ends are n't you to see if it was .
frankly i cannot imagine why companies would negotiate oil contracts only to try to convince the government to invade the country so they lose them .
taking some of the responsibility for enforcing a no fly zone ( i.e . patrolling shooting down any planes which __name1__ uses to bomb civilians ) would have been acceptable due to the __name2__ resolution and the fact that civilians in __name3__ were sitting ducks .
however , bombing ground troops in order to allow armed rebels to rampage further west is , in my opinion , completely against the spirit of the __name1__ resolution .
i increasingly get the impression that the coalition are not protecting civilians ( i.e . unarmed citizens , not rebels ) but rather are passively supporting the rebellion by decimating __name1__ 's soldiers who , at the end of the day , are just doing what they are told .
it 's easy to shout oil and the fact that it gets shouted so often means that it 's also brushed off by those supporting military action , without a thorough evaluation .
oil is not the only reason why the coalition are backing the rebels ( and i 'm going to take the plunge now and say that they are ) , but it is certainly a consideration .
__name1__ has stated that ( assuming he regains control over his country ) he will only sell oil to the __name2__ and the __name3__ .
the rebels on the other hand have stated that they are willing to upgrade oil production in __name1__ three @-@ fold .
people can argue that we are doing our bit by helping out the __name1__ in their time of crisis .
but why have n't we intervened in the numerous conflicts in __name1__ over the past __quant1__ @/@ __quant2__ years
i agree that we should be helping out all these innocent people ( im sure if it was the other way around we would want help from more powerful countries )
but why there and not in other places ?
i do think our main reason for helping is oil and resources , which is pretty much as bad as doing nothing as we 're not setting the example of helping people out in a time of crisis , its more of a " we 'll help but only because we might get something in return "
i know this is just how the world works , but there would be alot less trouble in the world if it wasnt .
anybody who believes the __name1__ , once again , intervened in yet another country on ' humanitarian grounds ' to protect ' innocent civilians ' is absolutely ignorant of history and cannot use mere logic , or at least does not apply it to ' queen and country '.
or , they could be the opposite of independent thinkers and accept the propaganda spouted by the establishment .
if the rebels were __name5__ , the intervention lead by the __name2__ , __name3__ and __name4__ in __name1__ would not have occurred , nor would the rebel opposition be supported , had they been __name5__ .
in other words , the intervention in __name1__ is not about protecting civilians , but instead entirely about protecting interests and siding with a candidate whom the ' coalition ' prefers .
if this was not the case , the __name1__ would be intervening exactly how they are today in __name2__ , even if the rebels had been the __name3__ .
furthermore , __name1__ and __name2__ have always stated from the very beginning that they were willing to intervene in __name3__ without the approval of the __name4__ .
yet the justification they keep using for this intervention is to ' enforce humanitarian law authorised by the __name1__ '.
to be blunt while being honest ...
history will show once again , that the real reasons for this __name2__ @-@ lead intervention in __name1__ was not about ' defending innocent people '.
and when it does , all those who supported this intervention should be held accountable for their ignorance and the crime of strengthening a system which has consistently proven , through its billions of dead victims , to be the greatest monster this world has ever seen .
ok guys , we 've seen how the egyptians successfully brought __name1__ down and at the same time theres also a lot of protesting goin around the __name2__ countries ; __name3__ , __name4__ , __name5__ etc.....
although it may not seem like it has nothing to do with religion , just politics ... i feel like the world is coming to an end or something cause __name1__ are finally taking a stance for their rights ....
after this , what next ?
was just wondering could there be an __name1__ revolution perhaps in the near future where the world is like coming to an end ? ??
this is probably a really stupid question but just give me some feedback about this matter
the answer is no.
guys..i know its a bit tedious but im just wondering..
if you guys can be bother than dont bother reading it then !
god willing , yes , if only to overthrow the corrupt governments in place in these countries .
none of these protests are __name1__ in nature .
they tend to be secular leaderless and made u mostly of the young .
what is wrong with __name1__ speaking up for their rights ? ??
explain yourself .
and as far as an __name1__ revolution is concerned i would say that it depends on how organized religious or clerical organizations are in a country and how politicized they are .
any analysis on the issue can n't be a __quant1__ size fits all jacket since the nature of the protests vary in all said countries .
it apeas noth __name1__ has started enriching uranium at a brand new plant that apparently is very modern .
seems odd they could build this . im betting on a lot of __name1__ maybe even __name2__ help .
it would appear they are going to ake more nukes .
ok so what are your thoughts on this ?
are they a danger ?
will this change anything ?
could we see a much more aggressive __name1__ ?
or will nothing change ?
i very much doubt __name1__ would be involved in this .
__name1__ are sympathisers with the __name2__ regime so possibly links there .
there 's very little anyone can do about it because bombing their nuclear facilities will result in __name1__ being obliterated and most of __name2__ being destroyed without nukes .
the only hope is if dear leader 's son allows change but do n't hold your breath .
hey guys , reading the news __quant1__ , __quant1__ can n't help but notice that occasionally , the __name1__ media ( __name2__ and sometimes __name3__ ) pictures __name4__ as a country who is heartless , has no respect for human rights , dictatorship etc.etc .
however , this past summer , i went to __name1__ for holiday , and it was nothing like the __name2__ media pictured it to be , the people all seem to enjoy life , no signs of human rights abuses ( i traveled to __name3__ to , the people seemed happy ) .
i can n't help but feel that the __name1__ media is portraying only one side of the story ( __name2__ ) ,when in reality we brits have also invaded tibet and the world said nothing .
i see that we are afraid of a __name1__ country rising , and i know they are n't the nicest people , but neither were we when we colonized 1 @/@ 4 of the world , or when the __name2__ drove the indians off their land .
are we right to be complaining about __name1__ when we do n't have a clean record either ?
do you think that the __name1__ media is demonizing __name2__ ?
as a __name1__ , do you think __name2__ is a cold , heartless dictatorship ?
i 'm half __name1__ and the __name2__ media is definitely demonizing china .
the __name1__ government has more support from its people than the __name2__ government does .
when the west criticizes china about its lack of democracy of humans rights abuses it 's usually only the __name1__ who has a problem with it and not the average __name2__ person .
and why are these clowns always complaining about __name1__ ?
the fact that they do n't care about uyghurs just shows what hypocrites and bigots they are .
that 's because whenever a __name1__ person does complain they get thrown in prison or shot .
__name1__ 's record on human rights is appalling look at the __quant1__ child policy that is causing major gender imbalance problems as well as being brutally implemented , forced sterliseation and such .
although i do n't criticise it on democracy as democracy is always right or good .
as for the more popular than the __name1__ government source ?
the media demonoising __name1__ is just what the media does , it demonises everything its how they sell papers with horror stories .
even if they get nukes __name1__ are still heavily outmanned , outgunned and isolated .
their nukes wont be as good as __name1__ and european nukes .
their uav 's wont be as good as isreali and __name1__ uav 's
their missiles will barley cross their own borders before they are shot down by a multitude of defences the __name1__ has already been preparing in the __name2__ for the past god knows how long .
the only thing the extremist __name1__ can possibly do is blow themselves up in our borders .
and they have failed that more than enough times .
__name1__ is a empty threat .
__name1__ with nukes however will unify and strengthen the resolve and moral of the __name2__
__name1__ wants to portray itself as the ' hero ' of the __name2__ against the __name3__ infidels by having nukes and defying the __name4__ .
so the more we talk about it , the more coveradge they get and the more __name1__ extreamists will orgasm at the sound of __name2__ 's threats .
so lets ignore __name1__ , they are like the kid in primary school with the attention seeking problem .
meh maybe if the came clean with their nuclear program and would accept help that the rest of the world is offering .
if they are so peaceful why not allow __name1__ inspectors in .
the problem is n't that they could potentially outmatch us in terms of nuclear capability .
the problem is that its monstrous regime will become more stable , and will be able to dictate the rest of the world 's policy towards it .
plus , one must consider the potential ramifications of thermonuclear weapons falling into the hands of a regime run by the clergy ; a clergy that has repeatedly laid claims to the island nation of __name1__ , supports __name2__ 's thuggish militia in __name3__ , makes continual references to the apocolypse and the return of the ' __value1__ imam ', and so on .
that 's without going into how it will make a complete mockery of international law and non @-@ proliferation .
__name3__ should become a republic when __name2__ dies , prime minister __name1__ has said just days ahead of a general election .
__name2__ @-@ born __name1__ said the queen 's death would be an " appropriate point " for __name3__ to move away from having a __name4__ monarch as head of state .
__name1__ voted against becoming a republic in a __year1__ referendum , but the issue continues to be divisive .
so , who thinks __name1__ would vote for a republic ?
it 's up to them if they wish to sever the bonds that unite their heritage , history , and present .
i do n't think the issue is that they have a hereditary monarch , but the fact that the hereditary monarch in question is a ' foreign ' one ( yes , i am aware she is queen of __name1__ in her own right , but you know what i mean ) .
i think they should keep the monarchy ...
the monarchy exists here for the same reason it does over there .
heritage , history and present , as the above poster rightly said .
it 's not a drain on their economy and their power and sovereignty is n't being controlled in real political terms .
i do , however , agree with the proposed flag change , if that 's what __name1__ want .
hold another referendum !
are we witnessing a new era of repression .
in the past nations would develop new technology to dominate its rivals , however with recent attempts to prevent __name1__ from developing nuclear technology are we seeing powerful nations using economic terrorism ( sanctions ) and war to prevent other nations from developing technology to compete .
for a nation with civilian and military nuclear technology to essentially deny another nation the same right to develop technology it is clear that the old guard of westenr powers are trying to prevent emerging powers from developing the same level of technology .
how can __name1__ stake its claim to its right ?
economic terrorism ( sanctions ) are essentially a way to ruin an economy its a modern day version of a seige and an act of war .
the sanctions placed on iran are designed to appear to target only military groups but with research you will see it massively targets civilian business , infrastructure and even the attempt of iranian students to study outside of iran .
this is an all out attempt to cut of irans blood flow and crush this nation .
what should other nations learn from this ?
other developing nations would be wise to realise that __name1__ powers have a stake in preventing the development of nations they consider inferior particularly __name2__ , __name3__ and __name4__ nations .
this realisation should make them realsie they must band together to defeat this racist threat .
i would suggest an economic block and the sharing of nuclear technology within this block to ensure their sovereignty from both military and economic war .
__name1__ has a vested interest in keeping certain nations poor and weak but with solidarity and strength these nations can rise up and defy this evil threat .
hmm here is a country that generally does n't like me should i let them build a big nuclear weapon they can kill me with ?
*thinks hard*
iran will get destroyed by the israelis before it has a chance to get a nuclear weapon , and if israel is unable to do so then the israeli race would be ( excuse the pun ) exterminated .
how can you be in favour of this ?
you make it out like hampering a nations development is somthing new !
since the dawn of civilization countries and provinces have sort do out do each other and gain from others weakness .
you say it is crazy that __name1__ forces sanction on __name2__ , yet it is not in their economic or defence interests to allow this to happen so in fact it is perfectly sane .
if __name2__ were to developed nuclear weapon , they would use them , and they would , theoretically , become the powerhouse in the __name1__ .
this is against __name1__ forgien policy for __quant1__ reasons , firstly they need to secure the safty of the oil fields in the __name2__ , and secondaly an anti @-@ __name3__ superpower in the __name2__ will more likely that not attract the backing of __name4__ , who already have made it perfeclty clear that they are inforcing their dominance over __name5__ .
the combination of an __name1__ @-@ __name2__ block in __name3__ and __name4__ would seriously threatern the __name5__ and the whole __name6__ world .
thus , it is just and needed for the __name1__ to impose such sanctions on __name2__ .
if __name1__ did say this , does he have any info as to what is gonna go down ?
do you think the americans will strike other me countries in the run up to the __name1__ attack or simulataneously strike ?
could be __name1__ perhaps ?
just hope we do n't get dragged into this war ; we can n't even deal with the __name1__ ...
let the __name1__ @/@ israelis deal with it !
there 's nothing about it on the __name1__ , but yes , a strike is inevitable .
i highly doubt the __name1__ @/@ __name2__ will strike any other __name3__ countries , in fact , i cannot see it happening whatsoever .
the __name1__ will do exactly as the __name2__ says because of this idiotic perception that both of our nations share a ' special relationship '.
the __name1__ will be dragged into it , you can bet your bottom dollar on that .
substantial evidence has been presented to prove large quantities of depleted uranium ( du ) has been used in __name1__ since the invasion in __year1__ .
[ edit ] ok since alot of people think the ' __name1__ ' is untrustworthy i will give another source which gives the same information about __name2__ 's statement .
i can n't bring myself to understand this in any way .
i remember seeing some pictures of deformities a little while back and could n't even believe it was humanly possible .
they disturbed for a few days after and that 's from someone who is n't easily upset .
back then i always believed that the leaders of our militaries would never allow this .
they would never allow generations of __name1__ 's to suffer from mutations and deformities like these .
i passed it off as propaganda at the time but now the evidence seems substantial and clear that this is exactly what happened .
what is the most upsetting is that our taxes funded this .
our taxes causes girls to be born with __quant1__ heads like something straight out of a horror film .
how can this ever be rectified ?
how can you explain to the children why they are born with paralysed limbs or are born with their eyes formed inside out ?
how can you rectify a system which has done to iraq what it 's done over the decades .
from supporting tyrants , to watching on and doing nothing , to several large scale wars , to crippling sanctions .
what harm were they afraid of from these ordinary , poor __name1__ .
you can n't rectify .
that 's ******* disgusting and i hope the perpertrators are made to suffer what generations of __name1__ 's already have and will ever endure .
remember those who champion themselves on human rights are actually the biggest terrorists in the world .
certain places like __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ atc , baathi scum strongholds deserve it for what they did to __name4__ and the iraqi people under __name5__ 's( may __name6__ curse him ) regime .
that 's ******** for a start the __name1__ would not a shell a town with du , it 's high density means it is used for penetrator core for armour piercing sabot rounds , to be used against tanks .
it 's a kinetic energy round and would serve no purpose other than in a pitched tank battle , of which there were n't that many in gw2 .
and that 's the __name2__ article , i do n't even need to bother trying to discredit something from the ' __name1__ '.
well that 's war is n't it ?
never liked it but when war happens you have to expect any atrocities .
they want to sue the __name1__ and __name2__ ?
it is a ******* war we would be stupid to give them money because they will only use it for weaponry to fight against our armed forces and they will probably plant some du in our country or even nuke us innocent civillians for payback .
sure we all want war to be just and we all think nothing like this should happen , but you 'd be naive to think this is possible and this is how a war should be conducted .
it 's a ******* war .
do n't tell me __name1__ countries like __name2__ and pre @-@ war __name3__ would n't invoke such methods if they could .
apologies for being so inevitably stupid but ... j am i wrong in thinking superpowers are judged by their worth , their gdp ?
if so , how can __name1__ overtake the __name2__ even as it grows in this area ?
it is still way off the __name1__ gdp .
i know the __name1__ have a lot of debt , and a great deal of it is owed to __name2__
also , are n't __name1__ ahead of __name2__ in terms of gdp ?
when you have 1 billion+ people , its almost impossible not to become a super power ... even if your army are fighting with swords and bows .... cos it simply is n't possible to win against the sheer amount of numbers
true , thanks for that .
but it 's not like their population swelled overnight , or is it ?
i 'm just trying to find out more about the subject really..
imo : growing military strength , economic potential and influence in international affairs make a superpower .
its their industry , cheap labour , huge workforce , investment in technology and hard working nature .
__name1__ is investing in the future , we here in __name2__ really are not ...
__name1__ is going for it headlong and because of this are developing more and more and discovering new things .
__name1__ also has less strict laws on what not to do...i.e they will test and fund things that we have regulations against .
they have huge industry which they dont care much in the way of climate problems .
they have a massive population ready for any dirty job .
finally , they are a hard working people with dedication and less slobby
do we really want another superpower ?
compared to the others , __name1__ look like a bunch of savages : disgusting human and animal rights records and a lack of freedom .
the gdp is rapidly rising each year .
lol @- __name1__ 's economy is less than half the size of __name2__ and __name3__ 's and almost half as small as the __name4__ 's .
coupled with the fact that the country has just been through a huge reccesion that has wiped off more than __value1__ % of its gdp , and that it is falling to pieces through political instability , i think im right to say its a joke @- not to mention the fact that its entire economy is based around exporting natural resources that will soon run out .
it also worth mentioning that as soon as conventional oil reserves run out , the __name1__ and __name2__ will have by far the biggest reserves in the world in the form of oil shale etc.
did you just refer to information from __name1__ in your argument ?
and some are sort of mutually intelligble .
they all share the same writing language though which i reckon distinguishes from most other languages .
worthy enough of calling each sub @-@ language a dialect i 'd say .
china already is a super power ; __name2__ monetary policy is practically dictated by __name1__ .
if they wanted to crap all over the $ they could do it on a whim - no other country on the planet has the ability to do so , let alone devalued their currency to such an extent it makes their exports look ridiculously cheap .
__name1__ in the global market .
it is a superpower without question .
however to be a super @-@ power you do n't strictly have to be a developed economy .
__name1__ is decades from being as developed as the __name2__ , regardless of the amount of money they have - chinas greatest compromise is time .
major cities are much closer to their __name1__ counterparts , however it is beyond where the issue lie in __name2__ push as a credible economic entity .
what ... so because i referred to __name1__ somehow my argument is null and void ?
seriously get a clue .
__value1__ got a few __name1__ people telling me that china will be #1 in the future .
a few years back , __name1__ magazine published articles about __name2__ 's becoming the next big thing .
hard to tell but anything is possible .
i bet __name1__ had no idea they 'd be perished in the late 80 s @-@ early 90 s .
like some people said this in thread , __name1__ won't allow it .
__name1__ wants to be the only example that represents democracy ( __name2__ being replaced with democratic system , etc ) .
because __name1__ is a __name5__ country , it would be harder for them to influence other countries politically like how __name2__ britian influenced its idea to different regions of the world ( __name3__ in language , __name4__ in legal structure and language , etc ) .
__quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ years is a very long time , i 'm not denying that __name1__ has potential and could potentially become the most powerful country in the world .
notice the world could in bold , some people would argue that if it continues this growth it would become the world 's most powerful country , both economically and militarily even i can see that , but the __name1__ will inevitably interfere , because it simply does n't want competition , it wants to remain being the biggest , baddest dude on the block , and with __name2__ arriving on the world stage( i.e the new kid on the block ) there 'll inevitably and undoubtably be confrontations .
__value2__ think __name1__ will become the world 's __value1__ largest economy - perhaps even the largest , i think __name1__ will become very strong militarily - perhaps not as strong as the __name2__ as it is light years behind , but still strong , perhaps even stronger than all of __name3__ combined without the use of nukes .
do i think __name1__ will become a __name2__ type superpower ?
meaning that its economy and military are both 10 times stronger than everyone elses - no i do n't , as i 've pointed out in my previous post , there 'll __name1__ will inevitably want to become the regional power of __name2__ , it 'll want to do some land @-@ grabbing of its own( __name3__ for example ) which will lead to its demise .
well i think __name1__ 's only real crime has been defying __name2__ energy interests in the region .
we saw what happened last time iran defied the us in 1953 under mossadegh , and the result was a __name1__ coup to put in someone who would happily bleed their country dry of their resources .
the __name1__ have only themslefes to blame for the move to the theocratical tyranny we see now , and most people would agree __name2__ pose no global threat , but __name3__ propaganda representing iran as some nuclear threat has n't been based on __name4__ reports or reason , but as the crescent of the ' axis of evil ',that is those who dare to step out of line .
all roads are pointing towards an attack of some sort .
whether this is jumping on the back of a popular revolution , or air strikes , who knows , but one is for sure ; an attack would have serious implications , and not just the further destablisation of the region .
i do n't think either the __name1__ or the __name2__ tick the boxes for me .
neither gained significant land , neither won any significant wars ( indeed , the most famous war __name2__ was involved in post __name3__ was __name1__ , which they flunked ) - hardly characteristics of a traditional superpower .
superpowers tend to make huge strides in bettering the lives of human civilisation ( the __name1__ did it by furthering democracy , the __name2__ empire did it with the industrial revolution ) .
the __name1__ and __name2__ certainly did n't make any groundbreaking revolutions .
these __quant1__ countries are best known for stockpiling weapons and racing to the moon - not characteristics of being a superpower .
they had the potential military might to rival classic superpowers , but times have changed so much that it was just never going to happen .
my professor raised this point this morning in class :
" hundreds and thousands of years ago , my family lived in __name1__ , in a consequent town where there were families like mine , making a little clan .
we were then chased from __name1__ , because we were invaded by norwegians saying that we were strangers , while it had been our land for centuries and centuries , and we could n't be considered as strangers .
do you ( asking the class ) think that nowadays , i could go back to __name1__ , and chase the people living there , with the only argument that my family lived there for __quant1__ of year ?
bearing this in mind , do you think that israelians 's motif for going back to their land is sufficient ? "
what do you think of it ?
is he racist , or is he realistic ?
to be honest if __name1__ was the center of his religious beliefs and if he had been persecuted all the __quant1__ after his family got kicked out he would have a different view .
more importantly he is __name1__ - and he is ruled by christian governments .
plus if you look at it from his point of view .
conquest determines land holding .
his family was in __name1__ , they got conquered and so ceased to own the land .
well the arabs that used to live in __name1__ got ' conquered ' per se - although a much more benign version of conquest - and so no matter what the original motives for the conquest were , they lost the right to that land .
he is neither racist nor realistic - just wrong .
well , are they ?
i 'm using extremists lightly , i 'm just using the word as something to categorize them .
as in groups like __name1__ , nazis and extremist __name2__ or any partly aggressive religion , could they all be counted as bad as each other ?
they can all inspire hate , change stories and have radical @/@ controversial views .
so could they be deemed on the same level ?
__name1__ exterminated jews ...
extremist muslism would liek to convert everyoen else ...
and __name1__ just wants to deport foreigners elsewhere ...
so no not really .
hate ( although i believe broadly is a bad thing ) is something i can live with ...
change stories ?
if you mean lie , then yes that is bad
radical @/@ controvesial are n't bad because they 're radical , they 're bad because of the belief itself .
why ? why do the public @/@ media favour __name1__ countries over __name2__ ones ?
what have the __name1__ ever done compared to __name2__ ?
i mean come on ... this seriously baffles me .
the __name1__ are biased against __name2__ , and therefore __name3__ .
it 's not really about __name1__ vs. jews .
this is not true at all .
during the recent attack on gaza by __name3__ the __name4__ were the only channel to not broadcast an appeal for the innocent __name1__ of __name2__ . even though all other channels did .
they seem to do pretty much the opposite of what you are saying .
discuss
only way you have peace is by having a larger stick than the enemy ,
i prefer the u.s to have all the power to say a unstable country like __name1__ .
rock on u.s.a free __name1__ !
no point in discussing this .
i would say ' no ' but they have nuclear weapons and no @-@ one is going to take them away from them .
disclaimer : i am really not an expert on __name1__ politics .
so , as well as the presidential election yesterday , __name1__ voters could also vote on a lot of state @-@ specific propositions , one of which was __name2__ 's proposition __value1__ .
gay marriage has been legal in __name1__ since __month1__ , but this proposition was in favour of eliminating the rights of gay couples to marry .
it passed .
i was wondering if anyone had any thoughts on this..
i think its terrible .
they should n't be allowed to do an about turn like that for no apparent reason , especially given the fact that it only recently became allowed .
they could have at least given it a chance __value1__ .
it 's just even more of a shame that , at a time when __name1__ appears to be turning a new leaf , there 's still so many people with this frame of mind .
it just really bugs me that it got turned round so soon as well..
gay couples should be allowed the happiness that marriage may bring , just like straight couples .
they should have just kept it legal and let those who disagree have a grumble and grind their teeth over it all - it 's not like they 're suffering .
this suprised me to be honest , __name1__ has always been known as one of the more progressive states in the __name2__ .
the law will probably jump back and forth in the coming __quant1__ .
__name1__ has a huge __name4__ population which obviously rejects it , not helped by the large influx of migrant s @-@ __name2__ __name3__ into the state .
okay yes , true , they were allowed .
which did mean people had the right to do them .
but i think the issue of the right to marry is different because people worked to get the right and to change the law for it to be allowed .
it was n't just a right because no one had told them they could n't do it , like your examples .
i think the issue here is not whether marriage is a right , but whether everyone should be considered equal .
either everyone has the right to marry , or no one does .
just as nobody has the ' right ' to murder ( which quite frankly i find to be a weak argument due to reasons already mentioned ) , either nobody should have the right to marry , or everybody should .
that 's all there is to it .
i would argue that any law that i judge to be unjust is inherently illegitimate and thus i have no moral obligation to follow it or consider it to be a moral principle , nor would i use it to guide my decision making in any more than potentially in a practical sense .
i certainly could not and will not respect the rule of law when it imposes restrictions on __quant1__ consenting adults expressing their love , and quite frankly i think that such unjust laws undermine the whole system .
you said you had n't considered prisoners not having the vote , and hypothesised that a good reason might be because they should have their rights removed for committing a crime .
and the incest argument is entirely related . if __quant1__ people are happy together , why can n't they get married ?
you want __quant1__ rule for all , stand by what you say , instead of dodging the uncomfortable reality that even you 're not happy with everybody having the same rights .
it forced schools to teach same @-@ sex marriage as a morally equal alternative , cal like the rest of __name1__ is full of religious people and they do not see this as right .
it will only take away the right for same @-@ sex couples to call it marriage , everything else is still there .
well , you 're sort of right ; we 're all being treated as __value1__ class citizens , but you sort of missed the point .
rights have been taken away in both instances .
the moral outrage ( here , anyway ) associated with one has not been associated with the other simply because one is acceptable and one is n't ; so it 's not the fact that a right has been taken away is wrong , its that you think x should have a right and that right has been taken away so you 're annoyed .
incidentally ; if you 're white , female , black , __name1__ , jewish , whatever ; you can still not get married if you 're gay .
if marriage is defined as a man and a woman then banning gay marriage is perfectly legitimate .
my point still stands : if you need a certificate from the state to live your life in happiness then you are a.) a pathetic individual and b.) a serf .
so much for the change in __name1__
when are people going to realise that sexual orientation , skin colour and ethnicity has no bearing on what is inside the person and their personality .
as long as you a good person , regardless of anything else then that is all that matters .
shame on __name1__ - it shows what the real attitudes on homosexuality are .
people pretend to be fine with it - but their is ignorance deep inside .
what a sad day for " new " __name1__ . it seems while racism is rightly widely condemned there is still a lot of homophobia around .
the sad thing is not that many seem to care
personally , i think they should have left it ( who cares about homosexuals getting married ? ) but it 's quite common in the __name1__ for things that become law by virtue of court decisions to later be subject to public vote .
this was __quant1__ such case .
gay marriage was never legislated for in __name1__ .
this proposition - approved by the public - trumps a court decision .
i was reading an article about how we need more black sold models for young black people to aspire to .
because apparently , all young blacks in britain need an extra reminder not to commit crimes and be involved in gangs .
this highlights a severely racist phenomenon that is considered completely acceptable .
that all these initiatives are exclusively targeting young black __name1__ people ( in attempt to curb the apparent swarms of exclusively black teenagers begging to be part of a gang ) while completely ignoring any other skin colour .
now obviously not every black male wants to go committing crimes all day , and the evidence suggests that blacks like committing crimes just as little as other skin colours do .
so why the disproportionate representation in the media and in crime prevention strategies ?
why does nobody care about crime in the __name1__ , the __name2__ or ( god forbid ) the white community ?
why is nobody saying how great a role model __name1__ is for all the young white kids growing up in council estates .
you can go anywhere in __name1__ and see that gang culture and criminals exist everywhere , in every ethnic group .
logic would dictate that a white oriented initiative would make the most sense for demographic reasons .
or how about something which does not base its case on skin colour and ethnic origin ?
do people really think that a poor white teenager does n't need support , encouragement or aspiration ?
i completely agree with everything you 've said .
i also think it 's this ridiculous idea that crime in certain ethnic groups needs to be dealt with more urgently that causes more problems .
if the ethnicity and colour of those committing crimes was n't mentioned , it would be much less big a deal . why this country feel the need to consistently talk about the colour of people is beyond me .
it 's like when we beg for __name1__ @/@ black police officers .
if they do n't want to do it , they won't .
we should be judged on our merits , not our skin colour .
i believe it 's things like this that make white people believe the country are going against them .
if the government did n't deal with things only to do with race , then i , perhaps naively and idealistically , believe that it would become less of a big deal .
in __name1__ , blacks commit a disproportionate amount of crimes .
hence , why they 're targeted .
most gangs in __name1__ are full of blacks .
black role models give black people hope .
it 's not about whether it should or why does it , it just does because black community are a semi @-@ community .
totally agree .
poor white people ( pre __century1__ th century , just poor people ) have been discriminated against for __quant1__ of years in __name1__ .
immigration happens and we 're suddenly part of the oppressing class ?
growing up poor and white in a mostly non white school was horrible .
having to learn about the evilness of white people repeatedly really does n't give white kids the impression that they have a place in our multicultural society .
the reason specific ethnic groups are targeted for trying to reduce crime is because , for whatever reason , crime overall is often higher statistically in these groups .
this is not because their race or culture is wrong or bad in any way , it 's simply a fact that certain groups have higher rates of crime .
whether it 's the result of poverty or cultural differences and stresses in __name1__ that are leaving them vulnerable to getting lured into crime , pretending that a group that has more prevalence for crime has n't is just foolish .
i do n't know the statistics , but if black youths are the target of an anti @-@ crime and role @-@ model drive , then it 's probably because they have a higher crime rate than other groups , and because the government wants to make sure that whatever factor it is ( because we know it 's not their race itself ) is addressed so they can have a better future .
and there are schemes targeting white populations , but when there is an imbalance between ethnic groups , it surely has to be a priority to address what is causing this imbalance - if for nothing else then for the sake of equality !
there 's a lot of talk recently about how diversity is necessary , but how far do we go ?
and how do we judge what is a good and strong @/@ positive multiracial country ?
when you look at other __name4__ countries like __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , the vast majority of its immigrants are not white these days and are probably heading for a more diverse future , so much so to the point that these nations will have very different demographic look to them in __quant1__ years time .
they will have great bragging rights you could say when it comes to multiracialism and diversity than __name1__ or most european countries will maybe not have .
you often here quotes like " __name1__ is too white " " the __name2__ are too white " but what defines what is " too white "?
so i 'm wondering if people could put __name1__ in the same context ?
like i say people brand multiracialism as a good thing , very few want to go back to a __value1__ % white society but how multiracial do we need to go to satisfy the vast majority of people , particularly liberals ?
i personally think it 's completely necessary but i know many of my opponents will disagree .
are we still not multiracial enough compared to some of our __name1__ rivals ? ?
what do you think ? ?
mate you are all confused .
when people say " the __name1__ are too white " or " __name2__ is too white "
what they mean is " the amount of white people in the __name2__ are disproportionately represented compared to the __name1__ population ".
i.e. __value2__ % of the __name1__ population is non @-@ white , but __value2__ % of the __name2__ are not correspondingly non @-@ white .
there is a bias in representation .
this is bad because it means certain races are being excluded .
this is completely different to asking whether an entire nations population should be a certain skin colour - skin colour should be irrelevant .
it 's absolutely sickening you would want to diminish a race 's presence just for the sake of it .
the question is pretty , well , questionable
i do n't know of many people who want diversity for diversity 's sake .
the issue with places like " white " __name1__ is the glass ceiling that keeps minorities and women out , as there is the feeling ( whether true or not ! ) that there is not a level and fair playing field .
funny how people come up with imaginary arguments from the " other side ", as i 've never heard any of these " liberals " you refer to .
i think , as usual , you 're framing an argument in a way that will make your so called opinion look bad
if a memeber of your family was going an illegal activty would you conact the police about their actions ?
obviously that depends on the activity .
i 'm not going to report my mate for driving at 80 on the motorway but if i suspected he was a serial killer i might be inclined to tell somebody
i do n't know if contacting the police would be the rationale approach .
i think i would personally confront that family memeber .
if i am unsuccessful i 'd get other family members to help and ultimately if they still refuse to listen -- i 'd leave them to their own accord and let them do what they belive is right or wrong .
because at the end of the day , my conscious would be clear [ in the sense that i did try and help them ] .
telling the police would not be wise , as you 'd be creating enemies .
it 'd depend what they were doing .
if i did n't think they were harming anyone ( smoking dope , illegally downloading music etc ) then i would n't report them ; if they were hurting other people ( violent crime , theft from individuals etc ) then i definitely would .
same goes for anyone i was aware of committing a crime , tbh .
i would n't go ' ooh , you 've murdered __quant1__ people with an axe , but you 're my mum so i won't tell anyone '
the main arguments i hear about this issue is that this country is ' full ' or that there 's enough unemployment as it is .
what exactly makes people feel that __name1__ people deserve to remain in this country more than anyone else who just happens to have been born into poverty or war ?
surely if we 're all equal then no matter where one 's born , they have equal rights to live in the __name1__ as someone born here .
i 'm not against immigration but i think it should be more regulated .
why ? because immigration has already caused a lot of " social issues " and until we solve those problems i do n't think its good to just let everyone in .
how should it work : education of __name1__ , their intentions , and to what they will contribute and most importantly their ideologies and beliefs .
to those whom the welfare state is the biggest concern i think the problem arises from the fact that there are already too many english people sponging off the state and if we add anymore people be it immigrants or " britons " our state of government would collapse and then our economy .
because i wish to protect diversity .
if immigration levels are too high , the indigenous populations ' gene pool will eventually become so diluted to essentially be extinct .
the cultural and genetic distinctions that make the world a diverse , varied and interesting place will be lost , forever .
so that means that in contrast to the general population they are actually slightly under represented therefore the __name1__ does not rely on immigrants as much as leftie __name2__ users claim they do .
well certainly in __name1__ they are here .
but to be honest if you live in a village like __name1__ , anywhere in the south west of __name2__ , or anywhere as a matter of fact in the rest of the __name3__ , all you will find are whites , but in __name4__ you will find ethnic people
besides this is from __year1__ , i 'm pretty sure that the figures would be different now .
correct me if i 'm wrong .
the data is nearly __quant1__ years old .
your point that this shows that there are n't as many immigrants in the nhs as people think is surely not proven by that data - immigrants can be white e.g. immigrants from __name1__ or __name2__ would be counted under the white statistic .
all i see on thestudentroom these days is agitated non @-@ muslims interrogating muslims , criticising their religion ( as any sane person would ) , muslims signing up to __name2__ just to post some anti @-@ __name1__ propaganda to persuade people about how evil israel is or how islam is the religion of peace
it seems that the blood libel rumour of medeival times that __name1__ kill __name3__ babies to use their blood for wine is today in the form of zionists/jews/israelis killing __name2__ babies just because theyre pure evil , and i think the islamic propaganda machine is succeeding in convincing people ?
anything which takes sides against __name1__ get a __quant1__ negs - its obvious __name1__ are in a huge presence on tsr .
with a quarter of all primary school children from ethnic minorities ( mainly __name1__ ) is the race @-@ relations and religious demography of thestudentroom a sign of things to come on a national scale in britain ?
from tsr to a national scale is a pretty big jump do n't you think .
also this is a forum where topics are going to be discussed and these are categorised e.g. religion .
so you have a choice in viewing these threads and not being part of this so called propaganda .
also in my opinion there are more atheists than __name1__ on tsr .
and what has __name1__ , zionists and __name2__ got to do with __name3__ ?
finally " a quarter of all primary school children are __name1__ ".
i 've been threatened by countless of them on here .
generally they need positive feedback all the time , eithewise they get really agressive .
most of them are racist in my opinion .
agreed , if people want to be __name1__ - then fine .
but when it becomes their life objective to annoy the life out people with their " read the quaran - or die ! !!" threads , it becomes a bit annoying -@ _ @-
over the past __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ years i 've had quite a few discussions with people about current affairs ( namely the issue of terrorism and the related issues of immigration , global politics etc ) and quite often heard a common belief that a british civil war will erupt when ethnic minorities increase in numbers and become more estabished .
this beleif is common amonst certain white british nationalists etc...
i do n't believe this will ever happen for various reasons ....
do any of you beleive that a british @/@ english civil war will take place ( on the basis of race/identity )?
if so , what do you predict/envisage ?
i believe it will happen ( something similar to what __name3__ has now to an __name1__ @-@ __name2__ type thing ) .
what a ridiculous comparison .
how is it any different ?
the only difference is __name1__ are still suffering injustice .
as the numbers of minority groups who do n't respect secular law increase they will demand greater autonomy , and mini @-@ vassal states will appear but still remain part of the __name2__ ( like __name1__ ) and things will get pretty tense .
so you reckon that __value1__ a large imperial power will rule the __name1__ ( like the __name2__ ruled __name3__ ) .
this imperial power will be defeated and then power will pass to another power ( like __name1__ became a __name2__ mandate ) .
so you think that an entire group of people are going to move to the __name1__ after a genocide , and then a state will be established , voted for and partitioned by the __name2__ ?
you then think that neighbouring countries will then invade this new state , that the native __name1__ people will be forced to flee to like __name2__ ( __name3__ ) and __name4__ , __name5__ , __name6__ , __name7__ , __name8__ and a part of __name9__ ( __name10__ ) .
that these british people will form militant groups , that want to return to the former __name1__ .
that this new state will be supported by the __name1__ who will provide it with diplomatic protection and weaponry ?
as i said , absolutely mental to transplant __name1__ @/@ __name2__ to the __name3__ .
not sure how __name1__ can call itself a civilised country when a woman is raped every __quant1__ minutes .
for some people , civilisation seems to rest on how rapists are treated when in custody and not how many rapists actually exist .
i am disgusted by modern __name1__ .
something needs to be done obviously the easiest way to stop rape is to deal with rapists a lot tougher and send out a clear message that it is not acceptable .
at the moment they are given on average __quant1__ years in jail .
its a disgrace .
no other country in the history of the world has been so permissive towards criminals .
britain : weak on crime , tough on the victims of crime .
on a serious note rapists should have longer sentences , i would be happy for them to spend their whole lives in prison if it 's beyond practically any doubt they raped someone
i do n't see how tougher prison sentences will prevent rapes from occurring .
the appellation of ' rapist ' is stigmatising enough ; the scum who rape people clearly do n't care about the consequences .
the sentences rapists and paedophiles ae given are jokes .
wow , people are so reactionary .
there are so many different types of rape , and situations , a single life sentance makes no sense .
it is a crime of massive degrees of difference , i think the mark of a good legal system is that it can deal with every individual crime , rather than simply handing out the same punishment ragrdless of the circumstance .
that said , we could be tougher on all criminals , not just rapists .
and , to put things into perspective , how often do women have consensual sex ?
what 's that ?
you do n't know(!)
oh well nvm then ...
bring back capital punishment .
sorry to have to point out the bleeding obvious to the majority of you , but it seems like a minority of users actually have to be told this : do not make troll posts or " jokes " about rape , it is n't funny .
for rape ?
are you for real ?
not just rapists , overall perhaps ?
i 'm honestly shocked by that number , i would have thought it would be more than that .
although that is just the number of reported rapes , which probably does n't even account for half .
what do you mean by that ?
do you think it 's not one of the most serious crimes ?
i keep frequently seeing threads made hating on __name1__ , which is somewhat hypocritical and disturbing i believe in many cases .
i am an atheist ; therefore i am not trying to defend __name1__ out of being ' islamic ' before i am accused of that .
i am also considered by british nationalists to be __value1__ % british ( although i reject the idea that it makes a real difference ) , so i am not showing sympathy for __name1__ out of experiencing similar hostility or racism .
however , i do believe that __name1__ and __name2__ , along with other major religions , all play very similar and negative roles in the world .
therefore , i do not believe we should be cherry @-@ picking __name1__ as some specific evil , but rather opposing all religions for the extremely negative roles they play in the world .
the usual argument held against __name1__ is that it is responsible for terrorism .
this may be correct , but the fact of the matter is ; whether somebody is using __name1__ to commit terrible acts , regardless of the wrongdoing , all major religion play a large role in shaping societies , and ultimately , fulfil playing a very similar negative role .
and when using the idea that __name1__ ‘ inspires terrorism ’, if we were honestly that bothered about such wrong @-@ doing in the world , then we would surely be more concerned with ending the much more severe crisis 's and wrong @-@ doing 's such as starvation and war .
both of these ills are far more widespread and important than the threat of terrorism , as of which we are more liking to die by our own hands rather than by the hand of an ' __name1__ terrorist '.
it is almost unbelievable how the idea that a __name1__ should have any sympathy or support when they proclaim a dislike for __name2__ , when the religion they subscribe to right now in britain , is playing a much more negative role .
we should oppose religion simply on the basis that all religion plays a negative role .
but we should not bully specific religions because of certain conditions and influences of the societies we presently live in .
this is of course , an argument only for those who aspire to reason , rationality and evidence in mind .
i have no expectation that i will be receive any support for my remarks by __name1__ or other adherents of major religions .
i am an atheist and i think __name1__ is the most inherently evil religion out of all the other ones .
i would choose to live in a __name1__ society over a __name2__ one any day .
as an atheist i can differentiate between __name2__ and __name1__ , in that __name1__ is progressive , whilst islam is not .
well to be honest it 's a __quant1__ headed coin .
i completely agree sometimes , there is a horrendously bad labeling of __name1__ unnecessarily .
but sometimes it does no come under as much criticism ( for small cases , not the religions as a whole ) as other religions because people just get labelled racist .
i know everybody is gonna neg me as racist but someone has to say it .
similarly to how not all claims are created equal , and individual claims require differing levels of evidence , neither are all religions created equal and it is rational to dislike a certain religion over another if one can be shown to be more detrimental to another .
so it is irrelevant that you believe all religion plays a negative role , even though i agree with you , because our priorities should be focused on those which are the most detrimental .
would you honestly have us use the same resources in combating the negative effects of __name1__ and combating the negative effects of __name2__ ?
i would also like you to back up your assertion that __name1__ , which in this country is in a weak and almost laughable form , is playing a more negative role in britain 's society than __name2__ is right now .
also , reading your posts you appear to be a highly arrogant , self @-@ righteous , and cocky person .
your __value1__ sentence is almost cringe worthy in its self @-@ importance .
you 're __quant1__ .
time to get some humility and eat some humble pie , because i guarantee you 're going to be wrong on countless things throughout your life .
if you compare a traditionally christian/buddhist/whatever country to a traditionally __name1__ country in terms of stability , equality , safety and crime , quality of life etc , there 's a good chance the non @-@ __name1__ one is going to come out on top ( there would likely be exceptions , but as a general rule .)
that is __quant1__ reason why people perceive it to be worse for society .
and i do n't say this out of hate .
i 'm aware that most individual __name1__ are friendly and civilised fellows .
we live in an age where celebrities are gods and fame is sought after above all else .
people go crazy when seeing celebrities , faint when they touch them and track their each and every movements via magazines , hell there 's a subforum dedicated to them on this site !
why do we feel the need to elevate people to celebrity status and worship them ? i really do n't understand how this culture emerged and why .
must have something to do with providing people with gods to worship and adore in an age in which gods have been killed . by doing so , i guess , many people are saved from nihilism as a result of the loss of values from the death of __name1__ . thus , superstars and rockstars are put on a pedastal for people to look up to and aspire to be like . if we were living in ancient __name2__ , for example , the superstars and rockstars would be the heroic gladiators , but the best gladiators were often thought of as gods in their own right . they were supposedly treated like gods . ceasar himself was worshipped as a __name1__ by the people . the gods of yestreday are the stars of today . when __name3__ became famous they were saying he was a __name1__ . great individuals are sometimes regarded as more than human by their fans . __name4__ , __name5__ , __name6__ , __name7__ , __name8__ , __name9__ , __name10__ , __name11__ , __name12__ , __name13__ , boy bands like __name14__ , __name15__ and the like .
i think its disgusting that the death of a drink and drug adict got __quant1__ seperate articles on the __name1__ website , and there wasnt even a mention of the __name2__ soldier killed in the same week . people need to get priorities in order
i can n't recall hearing of this much before the riots of late , so i wonder whether it will become a regular crime from now on .
it does n't have to occur alongside a riot , but carefully planned and limited to a close circle , it could be a very lucractive crime .
if a circle of 10 @-@ 15 target a high @-@ end retailer during a perfectly normal shopping day , perhaps at a strategic location and time , i do n't really see what could stop them from looting a shop with lots of valuable merchandise within proximity of the entrance e.g. luxury clothes shop .
if we made that number 100 @/@ 200 it would be nearly impossible to stop them .
are you trying to set something up or what ?
that 's different though , the riots were promoted like a chain letter , were n't they , rather than a plot between a few people who all actually knew each other , and therefore could be rounded up fairly easily .
and surely it 's just " looting " because it was still associated with general civil unrest .
but people will see the footage of them carrying off luxury goods for nothing and even posing alongside plasmas .
they 'll get ideas .
apparently it was in a multicultural office . my arse it was .
even our own __name1__ people arent even allowed to do anything because it will offend these immigrants ...
as __name1__ says , " so what if youre offended ?
im offended by backwards baseball caps and chewing gum , doesnt mean im going to abolish it "
okay , i meant to say banned , not arrested .
id like to make this clear , its not the __name1__ were having a go at , but the officials .
they recieved complaints ( could be __name1__ , we dont know ) , and the officials said breastfeeding is offfensive to __name1__ .
why did the officials ssay that ?
i think its because this country is afraid of __name1__ - suicide bombers , poppy burners , stoning people to death .... you know the story .
these officials are saying its offensive because they want to go on the __name1__ good side and not make any enemies .
__name1__ is a bad religion .
in fact all religions are bad imo .
i think that 's a bit much .
it 's not up to __name1__ if she breastfeeds her child her not .
telling her to feed her baby in a toilet is also ridiculous .
__name1__ are n't offended by breastfeeding , it is just the labour councillor of the multicultural office saying ' it will offend them '
people like this just end up creating arguments between 2 different religions @/@ communities for no reason what so ever
you know what the problem is with this country ?
our schools dont teach critical thinking .
how much of a **** do you have to be to design a curriculum without critical thinking on it ?
if you can ban something somebody else does based on your faith , everybody else can ban things you do based on their faith .
if you want everybody else to use reasoning with you , you have to use reasoning with them .
how many of you support capital punishment ?
this is what i think @-
arguments for :
- those who murder deserve to have the same done to them
- can be a deterrent
- justice for the victim 's family
- cheaper than prisons
arguments against :
- the person killed could be innocent
- it 's inhumane and barbaric , the criminal may be able to be reformed
- it makes us just as bad as them
ultimately , i really do n't know how i stand on this issue . up until recently i was very much in favour of it . i 'd say that maybe it should be used in extreme circumstances but it 'd be difficult to know when not to execute someone .
any comments ?
to be honest i 'm for it if it 's cheaper . other than that , meh . __quant1__ think being in isolation for __quant1__ at a time would be worse than a quick death , although i 'm not sure .
but then , i 'm not sure if the death sentance would be cheaper , as you 'd have to have a mass of appeals and such like before hand .
i would n't support it for __value1__ time offenses , but when a criminal is given a __value2__ chance and reoffends , i 'm all for it ... i mean , if the evidence is __value3__ % conclusive that is , which is the case most of the time now with modern technology etc
i was on a tour in __name1__ last week when the operator on the bus asked where everyone was from .
as it happened i was the only __name1__ person on the bus , and when asked i said that i was from ' __name2__ '.
the guide then said , ' no you 're not , you 're from the __name1__ ' and started making a big deal out of it and i got quite embarassed .
i was actually really angry at that though because i identify far more as __name1__ than i do as __name2__ .
when we were in the pub later on , __quant1__ __name1__ also commented , saying that they did n't think it was right for him to say that , as you would n't expect a __name2__ person to say that they were from the __name3__ .
is it only the __name1__ who are n't allowed this kind of pride in where they live ?
personally i find it nonsensical to be proud of something you have n't chosen or done , but it 's up to you if you want to be proud where you come from .
i could n't care less really what my nationality was , it 's just letters on a passport ,
i still wonder what my identity is , a human being , a brit , a __name1__ ?
no , i prefer to call myself a overgrown monkey .
you are allowed to state where you 're from .
that is n't pride . that 's just a statement of fact .
i do n't think there 's anything massively wrong to to feel a sentimental pride towards your country ,
it is human nature to feel attached to where you come from .
it is nationalism that becomes an issue .
his jumping down your throat was his problem .
you 're from the __name1__ and __name2__ so in my opinion which ever one you choose to identify yourself as you are correct .
you 've probably guessed what this one 's about !
in the __year1__ census , the question of what people 's religious affiliations were , and many people decided to put " __name1__ " in the hope that it would be recognised as an official religion .
it was n't . but __quant1__ people decided tocall themselves jedis anyway .
i 'm wondering what people make of this .
i kinda expected more jedis to be out there , although in all honesty , i would say that i have n't actually seen anyone wielding a lightsaber , so that may be flawed .
i just thought that seven in every thousand people is a bit small , since the campaign was well @-@ publicised , and there were no repurcussions for not telling the truth on the religion question .
so what does everyone else make of it ?
i know quite a few __name1__ put down '' __name2__ '' on the census as they did n't want government records that they were __name1__ - that 's how __name3__ managed to find all the __name1__ so easily - it was all kept carefully on detailed and accurate notes .
it can be argued that it is none of the government 's concern as to where each jew/muslim/sikh/christian etc. lives..
how would that affect gdp or the state of the economy ?
on the other hand it can be said that they should know who practices what as they run the country and can thus make laws according the proportionate numbers of each faith etc.
- as a __name1__ and having experienced anti @-@ semtism myself ( as many jews have and do ) i would sway towards the former view in terms of safety , but i can understand why people would disagree with this and choose the latter .
earlier this month the results from the __year1__ __name1__ social attitudes survey were published by the government .
the main finding , as mentioned in the title , is that for the __quant1__ time a full __value3__ % of __name1__ people no longer associate themselves with any religion , and over half of the people that do affiliate with a religion never attend religious services or meetings , with only __value1__ % attending such events on __quant1__ weekly basis .
it 's dying . good .
i do n't really care either way , to be honest .
all this really proves is that the question on the census needs rewording .
nice to see that those lacking a religion are now a majority , although thankfully __name3__ __name1__ tend to be very reserved and moderate unlike their __name3__ counterparts .
though undoubtedly many of the responses on this thread will still use the __year1__ census as a reliable source for religious demographics despite the fact it 's __quant1__ years old .
good .
will be interesting to compare this to the census data when it 's released .
i am regaining my faith in humanity .
__name1__ next .
__name2__ is probably a lost cause , but i 'm pleased to see we 're going __name1__ .
this is n't intrinsically an anti @-@ __name1__ thread .
nor am i saying that other religions do n't have followers that do things that are similar and worse .
today that 's not my focus .
millions of lambs were ritually killed a short time ago .
many __name1__ making the claim that it was done in a way that is painless .
however , i 'm unsure of what is really going on .
children were seen to be showing disrespect and a lack of caring .
adults the same .
even if you claim that animals and humans simply are n't equal , it does not justify harming them .
it would be like claim i am above someone else therefore i can do what i want to them .
it does n't make any sense .
this video shows the lambs , which appear to be in a great deal of pain , being killed .
my question is , how is that peaceful ?
or justified ?
in this day and age in the __name1__ world it has become increasingly easy to be a vegan .
so why would you put animals intentionally through unnecessary pain and suffering ?
graphic video in spoiler :
__quant1__ minutes in you see a lamb killed .
6.44 what looks like salt is put over where the wound will be . will this not worsen the pain ?
during the __name3__ , __name1__ remember and commemorate the trials and triumphs of the prophet __name2__ ( as ) .
the meat from the sacrifice of __name1__ @-@ __name1__ is mostly given away to others although there is no limit to what may be eaten or given in charity or used to feed the poor or the rich or even if one wants to give it away cooked or uncooked .
generally though , it is preferred that you give most of it in charity .
the method of slaughter is similar to the one used throughout the whole world , by muslims and non @-@ muslims .
there are probably many variants though but considering __quant1__ method " worse " than another is subjective .
the most important difference though is that in __name1__ , you are obligated to put the animal under as little pain as possible and to treat it humanely ( during the slaughter and every instant of it 's live before it ) .
anyone who says halal ritual does not cause pain is a liar .
i have seen an animals throat slit and it survived and was in a lot of pain .
ironically it was a pig that was being slaughtered .
i was in __name1__ and they slit its throat .
before any __name1__ says " it was n't done properly , " do n't talk that crap .
the cut was so deep i was surprised it was n't fully decapitated .
however the pig squealed in agony and was still running until it bled out .
i 'm sorry but its all a load of crap " halal doesnt cause pain "
if you have a problem with the slaughter of animals , you should be vegetarian and disapprove of all slaughter , which i assume you are .
why this has anything to do with __name1__ and a festival where lambs are slaughtered for the poor in memory of __name2__ 's ( __name2__ 's ) loyalty to __name3__ i do not see .
oh and btw , a few years ago __quant1__ was in a town near my home city in __name1__ with my family for __name2__ - and literally the people there were starving and malnourished beyond belief .
to such people , the pain of an animal is the __value1__ thing on their mind .
i only mention because it is so easy to view things from a __name1__ __value1__ world perspective , which is why we also criticise __name2__ fur farms where furs are stripped from animals when they are alive causing unbelievable pain for incredibly long extended periods , but to a __name2__ family in the remote rural regions , it is their only source of bread and butter - and trust me , these people who really do not know whether they will get another meal ( unlike the gluttony we engage in 24 @/@ 7 since birth here in the west ) think very differently from us - and justifiably so .
the recent case of the __name1__ pastor in __name2__ has given me cause to ponder the question in the thread title .
here we have a man who knows that his life is in great peril if he refuses to recant his __name1__ faith , yet that is exactly what he does .
it goes without saying that his bravery is truly commendable .
his possible martyrdom parallels that of the apostles who evangelised in the knowledge that what they were doing would likely get them killed .
i often wonder if i would be so brave if i were in their shoes
i love god more than anything , but it 's impossible to imagine what kind of pressure the pastor in __name1__ is under .
would you sacrifice yourself in defence of your faith ?
yes , without doubt , yes i will sacrifice myself in defence of my faith .
god did sacrifice himself for us , so i thought it 's sensible for us to sacrifice ourselves for our religion .
even if i was religious i doubt i would ever die for my religion .
whats the point ?
do you think it gets you an automatic ticket to heaven ?
is it going to change the mind of the one who killed you ?
what about your family and friends ?
if someone holds a gun to your head and demmands you recant , just f***ing do it ! !
it doesnt mean anything , god isnt going to deny you access to heaven because you made a perfectly rational decision under intense pressure
i 've been watching some of his videos and i definitely think he has a right to criticize religion if he wants to .
but i find a lot of the time he makes such sweeping statements and sometimes unnecessary insults that annoy me .
what do you think of him and his videos ?
he 's a bit aggressive , raves and rants a lot , and mixes up a lot of different political stances into __quant1__ bundle when many are in no way related , but beyond that ....
yeah , guy speaks a lot of truth .
everytime when i watch him , i think to myself " okay , we get it .
you hate __name1__ .
and your point is..?".
just spotted the thread about the __name1__ , and looking over at it they 're seems to be some people claiming to not only believe in bigfoot but claim to have seen one , not im not sure if this is sarcasm , but what the hell ....
anyone seen a real life sasquatch ?
i 've seen an actual photograph of an actual person in an actual bigfoot costume .
does that count ?
for any who were n't already aware huntster believes he came upon a sasquatch trackway and i while camping with friends on __name1__ several years ago found __quant1__ sets of tracks and had a close range audio encounter with what at the time i attributed to sasquatch( es @- at the time __quant2__ thought there was an adult and juvenile ) but now i discount the event as inconclusive and likely mistaken identity given the spurious nature of bf evidence .
however , i still fel pretty confident i could rule out hoaxing because of the remoteness of the area .
but hey , you never know ...
i actually surfed in after __quant1__ year because __quant1__ wanted to hear the __name1__ side on this issue . no one appears to have posted about this yet .
apparently , the __quant1__ folks that died paid nearly __quant2__ dollars to attend the new age sweat led by two time __name1__ guest .
__name1__ - a non @-@ __name2__ , lead over 60 people into the sweat ' lodge '.
__quant1__ people became ill , and __quant2__ more is still in critical condition tonight .
i just read about this story .
it 's a tragedy , and i also find it revealing that the new age guru in question , __name1__ , has since left the state of __name2__ .
from what i understand , it sounds like __name1__ did n't know what the hell he was doing , because he put entirely too many people in entirely too small a space .
in addition , they covered the lodge with materials that did n't allow for decent air flow .
put all of that together , and you have a situation ripe for asphyxiation .
apparently they are still wanting to question the guy .
they said he was uncooperative .
i do n't know much about the laws on this but would n't it be negligent homicide or something ?
this would be an interesting story to keep up with .
i have been searching for this story to no avail .
a few weeks ago me and a few friends watched a tv show on __name1__ ( their house not mine ! ) where a guy claims to have recovered from a coma with a newfound ability ...
he can play the piano like an expert .
he says he can n't write music , but he sees musical notes in his mind and he can " miraculously " play them seemingly perfect , or close to it .
he claims to have no musical training and has never played an instrument in his life .
my b.s. meter went off , of course .
does anyone here have more information about this guy ?
i can n't remember his name ... i think he is in the __name1__
i can n't find anything on the web or here at __name1__ .
for musicians : i wonder how he would handle key signatures since he says the notes just fly by in his mind .
are they notated as sharp or flat ?
or is he stuck in __name1__ forever ?
my off the cuff guess is that he played the piano before the coma .
perhaps he is a failed musician and saw an opportunity to get into the limelight .
i would think people in his life would know that he could play previously , but as we all know , believers won't care , or simply claim that these people are lying .
the ability to play the piano and other instruments to a high level not only involves technical ability but also physical training ( remember the __value1__ time you tried to span notes on a guitar or piano ? )
how is it possible he woke with all his piano playing muscles fully developed ?
well in the case of the guy __name1__ writes about , it was more a matter of waking up to a newfound passion for the piano , not that he woke a fully developed piano player .
he claims to have been a guy who listened to rock music before the accident , but afterward could n't get enough of piano music , started to sit down at a piano to play , and then more and more often , and then he was hearing music in his head , and it just became an obsession .
so nothing really mystical about it . the man himself seems to put a spiritual spin on it , but it makes sense all the same without it .
i 'd say it 's not impossible .
he seems to be playing by ear .
his music is unstructured ; it sounds like he 's just playing whatever comes into his head .
he 's not playing classical works like __name1__ .
also , i 'd say he 's self @-@ taught at the very least .
watch his hands .
he does n't hold them in the typical positions that most piano players are taught .
he looks like he 's just stabbing at the next note he wants to play .
it has been noted that there have been a lot of threads created on the topic of global warming .
a great number of these topics rapidly descend into bickering and other rule violations .
although __quant1__ of the biggest threads was put on moderated status , it seems that many of the other threads have sprung up in order to avoid moderated status .
that thread has now been closed .
since many of the threads cover the same or similar ground , we 've decided to keep only this thread for general global warming discussions , which will be moderated .
unless the topic is very different from the " general " discussion , new threads and posts about global warming will be moved to that thread if they satisfy the membership agreement .
failure to confine general discussions to this moderated thread or starting other threads for general discussion will be treated as rule __value1__ violations and subject to a series of escalating penalties just like any other membership violation .
we hope this will encourage civility in the discussion of global warming .
we realize this topic inspires strong emotion , but please contain your emotion to those forms which are permissible under the membership agreement .
i do n't know if you guys have followed potholer54 's channel on __name1__ , but his series of delightfully devastating and withering videos on climate science and creationism are something to behold .
the latest in the series looks at the " scientists " that represent the denialist side in the climate " debate "
__quant1__ 'm aware of __value1__ , have read a few articles and what not over the last few months .
the response was of course tongue and cheek , a commentary on the nonsense that you can n't have a meaningful discussion without hot links .
hoepfully this new thread will promote just such discussions .
i do n't see how , short of turning to nuclear entirely , how we can reduce __name1__ levels without sequestering and ge .
not only that , but if you believe the current models to be accurate , we need to reduce the effects of __name1__ now .
so this could have been in the science , music , or current events forum and if any mods should choose to move it , that will be fine with me .
i 'm watching the __name1__ and they 've put on a tribute to __name2__ including campbell singing __name3__ .
and in the tribute they announce he has __name1__ .
it amazes me that people are being diagnosed when they still have enough thought capacity to discuss their fate .
being rich , i hope he gets to try the new treatment recently successfully used on mice .
i would .
it 's a drug currently approved for chemotherapy in humans .
this will be remarkable if it pans out .
so why did i post this and make it about __name1__ instead of just about the science ?
i do n't know .
it just struck me hearing the announcement __name1__ had __name2__ at the same time he was still well enough to appear on stage at the __name3__ .
it 's weird .
and the discovery of a treatment that is a drug already approved for use in humans should make a bit different of a pathway for research .
if you were wealthy or simply had access to the drug , and had __name1__ would you use it immediately instead of waiting for conclusive studies ?
i had this discussion with linda ( fls ) in the past and i really wish she had n't left the forum because i 'd like to use this example to revisit the discussion .
i can n't speak for her but i got the impression she would wait for the research to be more conclusive .
i use the criteria : if it is not harmful and there is some evidence it might work , and if there is no better alternative , i think it is worth trying .
in this case it is the potential benefit and lack of any alternative treatment and the fact __name1__ is such a devastating terminal disease that it outweighs the fact the research is premature .
what say the rest of you ?
i 'd do it in a heartbeat .
our brain is who we are , and without memories we are just animals .
you risk almost nothing , to gain everything .
my feeling is that when i grow old enough that i 've " had a good run , " why not donate my body to science before i die ?
if __quant2__ have some disease that will kill me in a few months or years anyway , then , by all means , experiment on me with some new drug that has potential .
and if i have some issue that won't kill me for awhile , well , what the hell if the new drug causes some side effects ?
i can always stop taking it .
either way , there is some chance that i 'll help people younger than i am .
and once i die , then take my body and do whatever is useful with it .
i do n't need it anymore .
i am my mind .
at age __quant1__ , with the possibility of __name1__ looming in my future , i would take any supplement or drug -- experimental or otherwise -- that may prevent or delay this dreaded condition .
obviously i would avoid anything demonstrably and seriously harmful .
many conjectures like nsaids , __name1__ , fish oil have come and gone .
i have and will continue to try them all until they are proven ineffective or seriously harmful .
precious little news on developments .
last i saw __name1__ scientists were saying that they may have reached the surface .
i am frankly about as interested in this as is humanly possible .
though i expect that little will be found outside of micro @-@ organisms , i have hopes that there will be discoveries similar to those around the black smokers .
my kids are hoping for __name1__ .
they may have to wait until after __name1__ .
a bit of an anticlimax considering the conversation we had on the subject last year ,
much more gripping than this thread mate !
the huge interconnected lakes about __quant1__ miles below antarctic ice can n't be touched because they must be under enormous pressure .
i would think that to drill into them would cause a collapse of __quant1__ of miles of ice , erupting water , flooding and wiping out area the size of __name1__ ?
as is usual at __name1__ , much hilarity and education then ensued ...
anxiety and inattention over __name2__ 's next __name1__
it points out that a magnitude __quant2__ earthquake is actually 1000 times smaller in terms of energy released that the magnitude __quant1__ earthquake that caused the tsunami last year .
however , the __name1__ of __year1__ which killed over 100,000 was a __quant1__ .
and , i 'm pretty sure they do n't mean that this earthquake will be exactly magnitude __quant1__ .
it could be bigger .
still , i think that __name1__ is more earthquake @-@ resistant today than it was in __year1__ .
so , i guess i 'll take my chances .
take your chances ? !
what do you live in __name1__ ?
curious ... do other earthquake agencies agree with the data from __name1__ ?
i would like to know what scale they 're using , because different seismic scales can result in enormously different results .
a perfect example is the __quant1__ largest __name1__ earthquakes .
the __value1__ was m7+ but did only minor damage and caused no fatalities due to a low mercalli intensity reading ( actual measure of intensity of shaking in a particular place ) .
the __value1__ m6.3 quake registered at __quant1__ ( intense ) and higher on the mercalli intensity scale and had the highest peak ground acceleration ever recorded .
many seismologists have said that the quake would have completely flattened almost any city in the world .
in terms of energy released , the deadly __name1__ quake was not particularly big , but in terms of shaking intensity it was one of the most destructive quakes ever recorded .
__name2__ 's " __name1__ " scale is like the __name3__ , but does n't have anywhere near as many divisions .
the highest category is __quant1__ which seems to equate with __quant2__ on the mercalli scale ( it goes up to __quant3__ ) .
this basically means a scale __quant1__ quake could be anything from a decently sized but not overly destructive quake right up to a city @-@ leveling event .
i heard this term for a single world currency .
why is it that cts seem to think this is a threat ?
we can n't even get __quant1__ political parties to agree on fundamental economic principles .
there 's no reason to believe that we could get the __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ to ever agree on a common currency .
plus , the euro zone is showing strains around the edges , so now would be a very bad time to try .
so why do you guys think the __name1__ invaded __name2__ and __name3__ ?
do you think our leaders really thought __name1__ had wmd ?
and do you think they actually cared ?
who benefited from the war ?
which industries , which money @/@ power interests , which lobbying groups , etc ?
why is the __name1__ posturing so strongly against __name2__ ?
are they really concerned about wmds ?
what would __name1__ do with wmds that would scare the __name2__ so much ?
__name1__ taking great control and spreading rebellion against __name2__ ?
regional arms race ?
__name1__ using the bomb ?
__name1__ had been toying with the idea of " revisiting " __name2__ ever since the __value1__ war ended , particularly in __year1__ , when __name3__ __value2__ started getting coy with the inspectors .
it did n't get much traction then because __name1__ was , at the time , experiencing a resurgance of isolation after the end of the __name2__ .
the issues were the same then , but __name1__ found the post @-@ __name3__ @/@ __name3__ __name2__ a bit more ameniable to the idea of war .
oil , wmds , __name1__ , these were all simply mcguffins .
the real reason is that __name1__ was a petty dictator who weilded an inordinate amount of influence and was continually giving the impression that he was up to something .
whether he actually was or not was n't the point .
be careful of special interest groups hijacking the message .
that 's what happened to the __name1__ leading them to be co @-@ opted into the __name3__ __name2__ .
even if people show up who you agree with on some political issue , ask yourselves if that issue is actually related to what the protest is about .
there will be , and probably already are , many factions who want nothing more than to turn the entire movement into a __name1__ fundraiser .
suddenly it will be about collective bargaining for teachers or something else that does n't involve a corporation at all , let alone __name1__ .
the partisans on both sides will try and expand their trenches such that your movement falls into them .
keep an eye out , do n't be the next tea party .
what identity ?
it 's a collection of every wingnut cause out there , from ron paultards to __name1__ to anarchists to anti @-@ __name2__ to people who like to dress as zombies .
they want more government , less government , more immigration , protectionism , etc etc.
they protest corporations even as they organize on __name1__ and __name2__ and __name3__ using laptop computers and smart phones , all fruits of corporations .
they rail against oil companies while powering generators with gasoline .
they want to end capitalism , while also getting better pay .
what entity will pay them absent capitalism i have no idea .
kids throwing a temper tantrum , basically .
they interviewed some of them on __name1__ the other day .
__quant1__ guy admitted they did n't have a cohesive message and he was n't sure if they could have __quant1__ considering the disparate groups that were there .
he also acknowledged the irony of using large corporations like __name1__ to get the message out and using the __name2__ to go to the bathroom .
the __name1__ printed an opinion piece by a mr eric x. lee which asserts __name2__ 's political system is superior to americas .
i do n't know if they though they were being edgy , but that 's a pretty stupid thing to print .
what next ?
__name1__ attitudes to women superior to the __name2__ 's ?
you think people should only print that which toes the party line ?
why was it a " stupid thing to print " - opinion pieces as far as i know are meant to be opinions and it may surprise some folk but not everyone holds the same opinions as they do .
given that news papers often print opinion pieces to raise interest in their title it seems that it is far from being a pretty stupid thing to print as we are talking about the newspaper ...
yeah , your thread title rather gives a misleading opinion about the nyt virus .
i 'm sure that was a complete accident of course .
i hear all sorts of perspectives on marriage . those who think monogamy is the proper standard , those who think monogamy is a tool used to oppress women , those who think that polygamy is terrible , those who think that polygamy is natural , etc.
but virtually ever culture in the world has some form of marriage ... a concept in which a life @-@ long union is idealized , where there are formal ceremonies to ' sanctify ' a man and a woman ( or multiples thereof ) . cultures where , from childhood , children are raised and taught these ideals to the point where most of us think it is a natural part of human nature .
the form of marriage may differ from culture to culture , but it is consistent throughout our cultures .
that is , except for at least one very unique culture , the __name1__ , a __name2__ minority group who live in the __name3__ mountains , close to the border with __name4__ .
__quant1__ years ago , i established a non @-@ profit organization to work with the __name1__ , focusing on a variety of aspects ( education , development , etc.) , but also on promoting awareness of their culture , and to trying to preserve it .
in the __name1__ culture , there is no marriage .
no marriage ceremonies exist .
there is no expectation whatsoever of life @-@ time bonds or pairings .
children are raised not only without an expectation of spending their life with that __quant1__ special person , but they often do n't even know ( or care ) who their biological father is .
in the __name1__ culture , men and women can change and choose partners as they please .
monogamy is not considered special or even particularly desirable .
the __name1__ live in large extended families , with many generations ( grandparents , parents , children , grandchildren , etc.) all living together in the same house .
men sleep in communal sleeping rooms ( they do n't have private bedrooms ) ; only the women have the luxury of a private bedroom .
thus , women tend to the the ones in control of relationships .
traditionally , a __name1__ woman will invite a man to spend the night with her .
the man will come to her home at night , sneaking in through her window ( it is also a part of the __name1__ culture that , while everyone knows this is happening , it should be done in a manner that is not obvious ) , spending the night , and then leaving early the next morning before everyone wakes up .
thus the term " walking marriage "...because the men must walk to and from their assigned rendevous each night .
the __name1__ walking marriages are generally the most interesting -- and misunderstood -- aspects of mosuo culture .
people are always fascinated by it , but misunderstandings and misperceptions abound .
one of the most common misperceptions is that the __name1__ are very promiscuous , changing partners all the time .
that is patently not true ; in fact , many __name1__ pairing will last for __quant1__ , and even __quant2__ .
there is no social stigma if someone does change partners often , but it is more common for the __name1__ to engage in what has been described as " serial monogamy "...that is , they do n't stick with __quant1__ partner for their whole life , but each pairing will tend to last for an extended period , and they won't generally have multiple partners while in a relationship .
however , there are fascinating and very unique aspects of these walking marriages .
__quant1__ , even among couples who are together for months/years/decades , they generally will never actually live together , or share property .
the man will continue to live in his family 's home , and his responsibilities are to that family ; while the woman will continue to live her her home , and be responsible to her family .
the man will visit her at night , but the rest of the time they generally live separate lives .
and what if they have a baby ? in general , fathers have little or no responsibility for children produced from such unions ;
the baby will be raised in the mother 's home , and be a part of her family , not the father 's .
however , that does not mean that the men have no responsibility ... it is just that the focus of that responsibility is shifted .
in most cultures , a man will be responsible to care for his own children ;
in __name1__ culture , a man is responsible to care for the children of his sisters/nieces/aunts/etc . so __name2__ men still have full parenting responsibilities ... perhaps even moreso , since they may end up sharing responsibility for the children of many family members .
now , in some cases , __name1__ men do want to be involved in their own childrens ' upbringing .
if that is the case , after the child is born , the father will go to the mother 's home , and present the family matriarch with gifts , asking to be accepted as the father .
if the matriarch accepts him , he is then an ' honorary member ' of the family , and has the right to visit and @/@ or stay there like any other family member , and to help raise the child .
however , this is not a frequent practice .
although this sounds very strange at first , it actually provides remarkable stability for the children .
__value1__ , they are not raised by just __quant1__ parent ; everyone in the family shares in parental duties , so the child really ends up having multiple father and mother figures .
furthermore , if the mother and father end their relationship , there is virtually no impact or stress for the child .
there 's no fighting over splitting property , because they never shared property .
there 's no fighting over custody of the child , because the child never belonged to the father to begin with .
the mother 's relationships with different men may change , but it has little or no effect on the children .
__quant1__ more thing i 'd like to point out . while this system actually works very effectively for the __name1__ , it works only in a situation where there is a large extended family to provide support .
for those __name1__ men and women who leave home to live @/@ work on their own in other cities , they almost always choose more traditional marriage .
after all , caring for a baby without its father when you have __quant2__ other people in your home to help you is __quant1__ thing ;
caring for a baby without its father when you live by yourself is another matter entirely .
for more information about the __name1__ , their culture , and our work with them , you can check out our organization 's website . and i welcome questions and comments about this , or other aspects of __name1__ culture .
while their way of life holds no particular allure to me ( my job consists of sitting , writing on paper and thinking about things , i am allergic to horses , my greatest joy is my __name1__ traditional family of my wife and __quant1__ daughters ) i applaud your efforts to provide as unobtrusive assistance to these people as possible .
diversity of cultures and thinking is a good thing , and i like your organizations emphasis on putting them in control .
i would suggest that you do n't worry about people who suggest that you try to protect them somehow from the outside world .
if the __name1__ do n't want you or your organization 's help , i am sure they are quite capable of telling you to get lost .
when you say " we " are doing this , who is " we "?
in particular , have you hooked up with the various groups like the __name1__ and the __name2__ ?
there 's a lot -- well , by linguistics standards , a lot -- of money floating around for doing exactly this , and it sounds like __name1__ is __quant1__ language that might be saveable if you can bring it to the attention of the appropriate professionals .
so depending upon who the linguists you are bringing in are , it may be possible @/@ practical to get some real heavyweights to come in for their support ....
wolfman , sounds like you 're doing some amazing work !
the __name1__ sound like a fascinating people .
matrilineal systems are indeed rather rare .
i think there used to be ( ) some in __name1__ .
i do n't know if property was owned by females but it was transferred through the female line ( a man 's heirs would be his sister 's children ) .
i think some of the __name1__ __name2__ tribes in the __name2__ plains were also matrilineal .
very interesting . what this shows , i think , is that while there is no marriage , there is also no illegitimacy -- that is , most children ( a ) know who their fathers are ( and the fathers do not deny it , even if they have no role in caring for them ) and ( b ) have __quant1__ male and female adults ( mother and her brother ) take care of them .
also , it 's easy to see why this social arrangement will discourage promiscuity .
in general , most men will be responsible for raising , roughly , the same number of children as they have , even if they do n't raise their own children .
however , if you are a man who has too many partners -- or , more important , too many children -- you are probably seen as a freeloader : someone who makes society take care of their many children while only caring for a few of society 's children in return .
am i correct here ?
you 're the expert , i 'm just making an educated(?) guess .
you have to wonder why this is not big news and her hearings kinda faded out of the spotlight ...
could it be that there was this long drawn out leak that was going to end the world in the __name1__ , that this administration seemed hell bent on letting continue ? lol
i am sure their genitalia will make a lot of difference when ti comes time to make a decision ...
i do n't remember much balleyhoo when the __value1__ black was elevated to the bench but then ......
i 've enabled multiple choice for this poll because i 'd like you to select which __quant1__ candidates will finish in the top __quant2__ in __name1__ .
the __name1__ primary is just __quant1__ days away .
in the average of the last __quant1__ polls there it looks like this :
__name1__ __value1__ %
__name1__ __value1__ %
__name1__ __value1__ %
__name1__ __value1__ %
__name1__ __value1__ %
__name1__ __value1__ %
in __quant1__ of the more recent polls , between __value1__ @-@ __value2__ % of __name1__ voters say they are either " likely to change their mind " or " undecided/uncommitted ".
what are your vote predictions for next tuesday ?
i 'm gonna ramble a bit and then reveal mine .
the consensus appears to be that __name1__ needs a big win in __name2__ in order to propel him in __name4__ since his __name3__ result was almost to the vote the same total as __year1__ .
no new support for __name1__ .
in ' 08 , __name1__ finished __value1__ nd to __name2__ in __name3__ and got __value2__ % of the vote .
how much of that __value1__ % right now is hardcore __name1__ support ?
inexplicably , he avoided an onslaught of attacks over the last few weeks as the focus turned on __name1__ , but now __quant1__ of the big questions becomes about what __name2__ really think about the idea of __name3__ cleaning up in __name4__ and quite possibly everywhere else , too .
i think __name1__ is a test of how comfortable or not __name3__ are with __name2__ as the presumptive front @-@ runner .
i think that like __name2__ , he 'll hold on to the support in __name1__ he got last time .
so he 'll come down to earth a little bit but won't totally implode there .
everybody needs to see the __name1__ speeches .
__name1__ 's was fiery and disgruntled .
he 's so much more interesting when he 's an attack dog and he is positioning himself now as wanting to be the fullback to __name1__ ; if he 's going down , he wants to take romney with him , and in the meantime that 'll let __name2__ have a positive week and float above the fray .
__name1__ is leaving __name2__ country and going into a __value1__ % __name3__ state .
between hard right establishment __name2__ there and that close to __value1__ % undecided number , __name1__ should be able to get into double digits .
but how high does he go ?
i think if __name1__ comes down to the low __value1__ 's and it appears that __name2__ keeps coming up and can crack __value2__ % again , it 'll be another soft @-@ boiled __name1__ non @-@ win win .
if __name4__ and __name5__ now represent the more traditional __name6__ establishment and are fighting over that share in __name7__ , __name1__ and __name3__ are sharing the __name2__ vote .
will huntsman be __name2__ 's __name1__ ?
__name1__ appears ready to keep cruising around __value1__ % and another top __quant1__ finish .
__name1__ is totally insignificant and should have quit along with __name2__ .
__name1__ 's ahead by an average of __value1__ % .
that 's going to come down to earth , but how much , and how much before it 's perceived that he 's falling and somebody else is rising ?
i think the threshold is that he needs to win by __value1__ % in order to gain any kind of traction as the front @-@ runner .
in __name1__ , my predictions ( actual results in parenthesis ) were pretty close :
__name1__ __value1__ % ( __value2__ )
__name1__ __value1__ % ( __value2__ )
__name1__ __value2__ % ( __value1__ )
__name1__ __value1__ % ( __value2__ )
__name1__ __value1__ % ( __value2__ )
__name1__ __value2__ % ( __value1__ )
that was with a day or so out .
this is more of a crapshoot at this point but here goes .
__name1__ __value1__ %
__name1__ __value1__ %
__name1__ __value1__ %
__name1__ __value1__ %
__name1__ __value1__ %
i 'm thinking it 's going to be __name1__ and __name2__ with a considerable lead , and __name3__ a distant __value1__ .
i would be distinctly and pleasantly surprised if __name1__ made the top __value2__ and absolutely tickled pink if he won , but __value1__ do n't see it happening .
__name1__ 's going to have to get some notice at the debate to finish in the top __value1__ .
if the others are attacking themselves like children , than maybe he can come up the middle and seem like the adult in the room and then nh will make a statement by elevating him to the anti @-@ __name1__ surging candidate in that state .
i feel like it 's going to be tough for him to break out .
you are probably right , __name1__ and __name2__ for sure , but once the light shines on __name4__ , the __name3__ voters are n't going to like what they see .
i still see __quant1__ voting blocks , __name1__ , __name2__ and someone else .
__name1__ has n't had a turn being someone else yet , and he 's more appealing to __name2__ voters than __name3__ .
__name3__ by a big number , because he lives in __name1__ in a palatial home on __name2__ , and he 's been working on this primary for __quant1__ years .
__name3__ because he 'll draw a lot of independent voters , and i think __name1__ is fading along with __name2__ .
this is all going down to how much the anti @-@ __name1__ vote starts to close the divide .
in the __name2__ poll for wednesday , it was __name1__ __value1__ % and __name3__ __value2__ % .
today it 's a __quant1__ @-@ day total now of __value1__ % to __value2__ % .
from a __value5__ point gap to a __value6__ point gap . now , if it 's __quant1__ points after __quant2__ day , but the __quant3__ @-@ day total is 33 , that means the __value1__ @-@ day stand alone would be __value2__ to __value3__ , a __value4__ point gap .
meanwhile , __name1__ is down in the __quant1__ @-@ day total back to single digits .
__name1__ 's small bump so far has costed __name2__ the most .
watch for him to hit the double digits in the next couple polls .
__name1__ is sailing with his strong __value1__ % .
i think the video below from a __name1__ movie is one of the best pieces that could be superimposed and run as a __name2__ ad .
i would love to see something like this run on national television .
it 's a preaching to the choir ad .
it has no place on television because it does n't speak to the undecideds .
near the end you could replace the " __name1__ " chants with any other candidate and it would have the same effect .
there 's nothing in it that speaks of __name1__ 's views or intended policies .
lastly , negative ads are far more effective than positive ones .
__year1__ . and still is relevent today .
the ideal __name1__ espouses here , will never die , and only get pushed back , to arise again .
humanity can indeed be thankful for that , that we only go through stages of insanity , and have the chance of overcoming that .
this should be an ad for __name1__ .
but he would have to cut his ties to the greedy .
his ties to the ones behind the curtain , calling the shots .
yet this thread is about __name1__ , so never mind .
i keep hearing tons of people run off at the mouth about how dangerous __name1__ 's foreign policies are and how they are out of touch with the real world .
the problem is that all the people who would be considered experts , and even __name1__ itself ( in regards to __name2__ ) , agree with __name3__ .
i 've been on __quant1__ deployments and my job is an __name1__ linguist of __quant2__ years .
i 'm fairly knowledgeable about how the culture works in that part of the world , as is many of the experts .
our interference does , indeed , cause more problems for us than what we are trying to stop .
we supported the rebels in __name1__ and it 's now being taken over by radicals .
who knows where __name1__ is going to end up .
anyways , are all the experts kooky as well ?
i find that the judge is actually one of a few mainstream conservatives that has a shred of honesty and actually understand what conservatism is .
if someone had only bombed the reactors in __name1__ and __name2__ , while the __name3__ and other countries had prosecuted and imprisoned all the traitors who leaked nuclear weapons information and gave the necessary technology to them ...
the __name1__ is largely directly to blame for the proliferation of nuclear weapons through its " __name2__ " program .
but back on topic , if __name1__ is " kooky " then so are most other politicians in any country on the planet .
and that is certainly true with most of our supposed allies .
911 was blowback from us sticking our nose in business that is not our business .
with that said , i still want to kill anyone who is responsible in the planning , or anyone who shields these people .
no one in the right mind would think the attackers just did it for shits and giggles .
they thought they had valid reasons to attack us . and perhaps they did .
__name1__ is not perfect .
they were hoping to wound us gravely by attacking our financial system . a weak link in our chain .
they should have just saved those lives , because we allowed banking to fuck our system up greater than __name1__ could have ever done .
leave it up to us , to be our worst enemy .
i think that a lot of people automatically assume that anyone who says our foreign policy is why they are angry at us is also justifying their response .
it is understandable they are upset , but neither __name1__ nor anyone else who is supporting him is saying their response was in any way justified .
indiscriminately targeting women and children is cowardly and people who do that should be captured or killed .
i really am tired of hearing that they hate us because we are free or because of our beliefs .
it would be like you building a shack in my backyard and every now and then one of my dogs goes missing , then when i get upset that it is there you say i am mad because you have bacon burger fridays in your own house back on your property and i hate bacon ( which is clearly only a hypothetical as i love bacon ) .
why ? because experts do n't agree with him on his kooky policy stands , which are manifold :
*denounces the __name1__ because it infringed the free @-@ market right of a monolithic white establishment to immiserate blacks ;
*dabbles in gold buggery and advocates the elimination of the __name1__ , apparently because the global economy worked so well back in the era before central banks ( that 's called sarcasm ) ;
*suggests that the border fence is being built to keep americans from leaving the country ;
*claims that __name1__ and __name2__ are unconstitutional and should be dismantled ;
*mounts repeated warnings that hyperinflation is right around the corner ( tsquare , take a bow ) ;
*insists that global warming is a gigantic hoax ( yes , __name1__ knows more about global climate science than __name2__ ;
*hinted that maybe the __name1__ helped to coordinate the __month1__ @/@ __day1__ attacks ;
*opposes government @-@ sponsored __name1__ shots ;
*and alleges that the __name1__ wants to confiscate our guns .
( list adapted from th is blog )
and this list does n't even get into all the racism and homophobia of his newsletters , which used his name , were signed by him and which raised __quant1__ of dollars which he was happy to pocket but have been disavowed by him now that they are a liability .
note that none of this lists mentions our relations with __name1__ .
there 's lots of kookiness without having to go there .
are you a __name1__ ?
my friend and i walked into a pizza shop .
it was $ __quant1__ a slice .
they had a special , a __quant1__ @-@ slice for $ __quant2__ .
if we both got __quant3__ slices each , that would make it __quant1__ slices at a total of $ __quant2__ .
we were assured the slices in the __quant1__ @-@ slice were the same size , so we got that .
we each pitched in $ __quant1__ each ( which can n't even buy you __quant2__ slices oddly enough ) and got __quant3__ slices each , which we 've just polished off in fairly record time .
we pooled our resources and struck the better deal for the both of us , and we actually made a joke about proud and full __name1__ .
now we 're rolling a joint from a bag of weed we each pitched in on in order to save money as well .
got our usual amount of weed each , but each paid $ __quant1__ less because one of us did the transaction and bought twice as much as usual for the individual .
if these things make me a __name1__ , than i 'll drink to that , but i just call it better business sense mostly .
real __name1__ would be they could go get a pizza without paying at all , and the pizza guy could come by their auto @-@ parts place to pick up a distributor cap without paying at all .
real __name1__ only exists in __name2__ 's kibbutzes though .
the problem you are having jason marcel is that it is impossible for many people , and especially people in __name1__ , to conceive of cooperation and sacrifice without force behind it .
they are so locked into their little me @-@ centric universes that they can n't see cooperating with someone else unless someone makes them .
seriously , i think the problem here is that a lot of people in the __name1__ , conservatives especially , when they hear the word " __name3__ " think of the __name2__ .
not only was the __name2__ not __name1__ , it did n't even pretend to be .
the word refers in __name2__ theory only to the end stage of social progress , what a __name1__ state and economy evolve into : a stateless utopia in which everything is shared equally .
when __name2__ is reached , socialism is no more , because __name1__ presumes the existence of the state , and under __name2__ there is no state .
the motto under __name1__ is " from each according to his ability , to each according to his work." under __name2__ , it 's the more @-@ familiar , " from each according to his ability , to each according to his need ."
the __name2__ was __name1__ .
it never pretended to be __name1__ , even though it was governed by something called the __name2__ .
__name1__ was what they were in theory evolving towards , but certainly not what they already had .
__name1__ is not a coercive system ; it 's the exact opposite .
neither the private coercion of capitalism , nor the state coercion of __name1__ is found in a __name2__ society .
if it were possible to have a __name1__ society , it would be a wonderful thing .
edit : i answered " no " to the poll , because although __name1__ is a beautiful dream , i consider it no more than that .
what do you guys think about a __name1__ run for president in __year1__ .
though he 's kind of old , he is still sharp and incredibly intelligent - and consistent .
his voting record is very consistent and he does n't vote for any legislation that is n't expressly allowed by the constitution .
given this , the grassroots support he had in __year1__ , and the fact that his message is very closely aligned with that of the __name1__ movement , do think he could head either a __name1__ ( or more likely ) __name2__ ticket .
i really think given __name1__ 's astoundingly consistent message and voting record ( and reputation ) that he could mount a serious challenge to __name2__ . w
hat do you guys think ?
the role of leader of the free world is not well filled by an isolationist .
paul/palin , has a nice ring to it .
once again the __name1__ solution is a geriatric nut , only this time it 's a relgious fanatic instead of senile warmonger .
i wonder , will __name1__ be too old in __year1__ ?
__name1__ won't be " too old " in __year1__ , but she will still be too hillary .
habemus __name1__ !
finally after days of intense political infight in __name2__ the new prime minister seems to be the biggest favourite for the job : __name1__ .
he is an ex @-@ __name1__ vice president .
but foremost he is not a career politician as his profession is actually an academic __quant1__ , partly in the __name1__ where he also studied .
__name2__ seems to be well respected in the __name1__ but also within __name3__ , as far as a greek prime minister could be respected in a country like greece where being politician has a worse reputation than being a bank robber .
i am positively surprised about this choice .
at least someone took over who has an understanding of economics in quite some detail and is not from the old political class .
i do n't think one could have hoped for anything better than that .
on another note . there are rumors that __name1__ could become the next prime minister of __name2__ .
__name1__ , also dubbed " __name2__ ", is a former __name3__ commissioner and will still ring some bells for example in __name4__ , simply because it was him who did not shy away from taking a fight with an extreme heavyweight like __name5__ over anti @-@ trust issues .
( same goes for companies like __name1__ etc ) .
if both news would be true , this would make the dark horizon look a little less dark indeed .
these __quant1__ men would be the best choice for their respective countries in times like these in my humble opinion .
they know economics , have a reputation of being not involved in corruption , dare to do what they believe has to be done and are convinced __name1__ .
the ex head of the __name1__ takes over at the helm of the world 's most financially trouble country and you are " positively " surpised ?
personally i was hoping for __name1__ , but obviously for different reasons .
he was n't the head of the __name1__ but one of the vice presidents , ie in the governing council of the __name2__ . for all the shortcomings of the euro , i can n't see how the __name2__ has done a bad job .
he seems to be a really clever guy , understanding economics like few prime ministers in the world probably , as he teaches it in __name1__ i think .
__name1__ would have been a great choice .
well at least it would have made the newspapers look more interesting ...
well , she 's not the most attractive woman in the world but for a politician there are n't many hotter out there ...
she must get lost in my posts , what with the other women and all .
i think i have a thing for blonde women ...
anyhow , so seeing as i can find myself talking positively about a __name1__ like this , is n't it your turn to talk about __name2__ like this in threads about the __name3__ ?
btw , i think given her experience in journalism and tv media , she would have done a good job relaying the message of what the essential need of bailout measures were , to the __name1__ people .
she also was very respectful in her final days of dissent in the previous coallition , and did n't even call for him to resign .
that i can respect .
it 's a very good idea to have a former __name1__ man in the job .
we have too many bureaucrats and lawyers and career politicians in charge of economic matters .
it is good to see someone with economic experience .
i think i 'm one of those who likes watching the __name1__ for all the new ads .
ferris bueller was alright and __name1__ was pretty funny , but __name2__ 's ad for __name3__ makes them the winner __quant1__ years in a row after __name4__ 's wicked ad for them last year .
i believe __name1__ is speaking from the heart , that 's why i think it 's such an amazing and curious ad since it looks and feels so much like the kind of thing the __name2__ campaign would find favorable to them .
__name1__ is a lifelong moderate conservative .
fiscal conservative , social libertarian .
voted for __name1__ twice because the man promised to end the war .
his __value1__ vote was for __name1__ .
he endorsed __name1__ last time out .
has n't endorsed anyone in that field yet , but says he likes __name1__ .
he says he would n't call himself a hardcore conservative or an extreme lefty .
from the stuff he is for and against in recent years , it paints a picture of the kind of voter that will decide the election , and i think __name1__ taps into that feeling of wanting to make a comeback happen .
there 's something to be gained by this guy 's performance , a man of rugged self @-@ reliance who also took the time to acknowledge in the ad that " we all pulled together ", his tip of that of course to the bailouts which he is supportive of .
the candidate who will win the election is the one who can tap into that emotion too .
great ad .
its half time in __name2__ and beer costs more because alcohol tax increases , your so hapy to be here at the game instead of your crowded house ( it 's been packed since your brother @-@ inlaw lost his job and home ) , your credit card bill is going to be major after the game , __name1__ will be investigating you because of a glitch in the facial i.d . software at the enterance , your job is being outsourced next wek , your team is losing __quant2__ in endorsements , a major corporation paid __quant2__ to sell their foreign made wares to you for justt a few seconds , and your car is being repoed in the lot .
we need voters that are n't swayed by gimmicky corporate ads .
i loved the ad till i saw that it was for __name1__ . considering they are owned by __name3__ , " imported from __name2__ " is a good slogan .
still a good ad , no matter who made it .
loved the __name1__ one too .
there were high expectations , considering all the prices they won with the __name1__ one last year , but i think they managed to pull it off .
i do n't even know what a __name1__ is but after last night 's commercial i 'm buying __quant1__ .
i have a hankering to send someone flowers via __name1__ too .
all and all , i thought it was a very down year for __name1__ commercials and i did n't even notice the __name2__ one .
it was a bit too political for my tastes but i do n't really care if car companies want to spend a fortune on __name1__ ads .
i 'm a happy camper as along as i 'm allowed to cast my vote for who i think is the better candidate and make my __quant1__ political contribution of $ 0.00 to all campaigns .
__name1__ was inspirational .
at one time the repubs would have thought so as well .
but they have become infected , and are really sick .
emotionally and mentally sicker than anyone has been in this nation in my lifetime .
they are not team players , they are so individualistic that it has become detrimental to the nation pulling together , working together .
they have taken individualism to a degree that it goes against the evolution of one of the most social animals in the world , the human being .
and " sharing " is seen by them as __name1__ .
it really is sad , in its most basic sense , because it hinders fixing what their " every man is an island " philosophy that is tearing apart the fabric of society .
forget __name1__ , forge the gulags , the __name2__ __year1__ opening that __name3__ made the queen and various sundry heads of state sit through was just plain evil .
i always assume these sort of things are appalling .
if the queen was n't turning up this would n't have much coverage here .
a bunch of foreign looking folk all in __quant1__ place only gets coverage if a crime is committed ( they 'll get blamed , even if they are the victim ) .
there has been a small amount of coverage of mr __name1__ 's problems , but since the government is n't going to charge him wiht anything it goes under the category of ' greens bluster '.
do n't you wish duelling was still legal .
it would solve so many problems .
imagine __name1__ challenging __name2__ to a duel at the __name3__ .
and __name2__ will have __name1__ as his second .
oh , happy thought..
actyooally , if a debt of honor is to be solved , there is no problems with , behind the tank sheds at 4 or behind the bike sheds after school , fisticuffs gadzooks , or in politico , s circles , in the duty free binge drinking bar in the __name1__ .
i was hoping for dueling between members of rival street gangs .
i 'll even provide nice hollow point ammo for them to use .
or something like the __name1__ .
__quant1__ men enter , __quant2__ man leaves .
__name1__ , part of the trio of peter , __name2__ died yesterday after battling leukemia for many years .
i grew up listening to their music and got the chance to see them perform when i lived in __name1__ .
i remember this group , and love some of their songs .
it was in the __decade1__ s .
__name1__ ...
i can never hear that song without imagining an __name2__ @-@ __name1__ or __name2__ @-@ __name2__ type gunship lazily swinging around in a constant circle , with sci @-@ fi lasergun @-@ looking tracers pouring out like evil glowing rain ...
no wonder those grade school psychiatrists were baffled .
hey folks @- i just found out that debbie had an apparently small fire at her house this morning .
i just talked to her and she 's home and physically fine and dealing with the immediate aftermath so was too busy to talk .
__quant1__ do n't know when she 'll have or use internet access in the next couple of days , but for those folks wondering who they could wish well this week , you now have a target .
that poor girl has busted her ass fixing up her house and installing a new heater and wood stove for the last __quant1__ months and probably longer .
that really sucks ! :(
i hope she is ok and the house is still livable in especially since she encountering very cold weather and considering where she lives and all .
thank dale for letting us know and please do tell her were thinking about her.:(
personally , i think they should peg it to inflation so that the pension has the same general purchasing power over time , but i know that economically it would be a disaster as people are living more and more into their older years , far past when people would traditionally die .
the retirement age has not increased , but the amount of time on retirement has .
eventually , the military will do away with retirement benefits , or at least certain aspects of them .
it is not the __name1__ alone .
ask me .
that is life .
they use you and then discard you !
sooner one understands that , one shall remain happy .
i am happy !
yet if the govt does away with retirement benefits the world over , there will be peace .
none will serve !
__name1__ , you had me worried there for __quant1__ minute as " they should peg it " means to die .
service pensions are " pegged " to inflation but usually capped to __value1__ %ish per annum , not much more .
servicemen should be recieving..service pension and state pension and if they are lucky a works pension .
times are hard and the forecast for the near future does not look too rosy .
the retirement age in the __name1__ is due to rise in the future , at the moment retirement is __quant1__ and government wants to raise it to __quant2__ .
i must say i also have little sympathy in this case .
assuming h retired out of choice and was not wounded , then it really is your own responsibility to handle your finances in my opinion .
the forces are just a job like any other after all .
this very thing was driven home during my __value1__ retirement class .
in the __name1__ you are required to attend the __quant1__ day of __quant1__ week long retirement seminar .
the other days are optional .
but your choice not your units .
around the middle of the day , the leader of the seminar started asking us if we were coming back the next day .
about __value1__ % ( almost all combat arms guys ) said " no , we have things we need to do at our unit ."
he said you all spent at least __quant1__ yrs doing things for the corps . now take __quant2__ week for yourself and be informed before you retire .
if any of you think that someone from headquarters __name1__ care about you once they kick you out the door talk to a retiree .
no one from __name1__ will call you to see how things are going .
no __quant1__ will call you __quant1__ month later to see if you have a job yet or if there is anything they can help you with .
and you know what ?
no one ever did in an official capacity .
the only thing i ever got from them was a " we want you to come back on active duty as a full time reservist ."
you will have to give up your retirement and disability payments .
once we are done with you the retirement checks won't start again until your __quant1__ since you will be considered a reservist .
and you will have to start over from square __quant1__ with the __name1__ .
the __name1__ needs you , do n't let us down ."
i had better things to do .
i think i let them down .
all aboard are reported safe .
aircraft dropped in an apparent decompression state with passengers on oxygen from 40k in a controlled dive .
cause of the hole is unknown , aircraft is not old , being delivered in __year1__ .
i 'm sure that it must have been alarming for all concerned .
the hole is enormous .
i flew out of __name1__ last week .
:( that could have very well been me !
despite now performing maintenance overseas , as __name1__ said in __name2__ , the only airline not to have had a crash ( jet aircraft that is )
and i have __quant1__ clients who work for __name2__ , __quant2__ a __name1__ long haul pilot , the other a aircraft engineer .
let me open with a brief reminder ( or history lesson ) of __quant1__ of the reasons __quant1__ started watching this show :
now that was funny .
__name1__ was funny ...
" __name1__ " back then had ' ass @-@ kicking ' interviews ...
oh , yeah , and " five questions " ( a wholy owned subsidiary of craig industries ... )
now we have a sitting vice @-@ president appearing on this show ...
granted , a new host ( and granted the second clip was n't from the original " __name1__ ") but this is a news show ?
i 'd put in the __name1__ clip , only ' twasn't to be found on the intar @-@ tubes ... how droll ...
anyhow , when did the " __name1__ " become such an institution of news that sitting heads of state would appear on such a thing ?
i guess it got gravity when lots of young kids starting watching .
but you have to realize , __name1__ went on __name2__ , __name3__ and __name4__ have been on __name5__ , and every __name6__ candidate for governor went on __name7__ .
__name1__ is fun and very successful .
puts paid to the whole o reilly fox crap that no one watches liberals .
__name1__ has a great job ... he can give absolute free range to his opinions without any restrictions that the regular news show have .
it 's no more a news show than __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ etc.
it 's a comedy show that has some commentary , __name1__ would be the __value1__ to say it 's news .
if anyone is using this a real source of news , they need to get out more .
but still , he makes me laugh and most of the time i think he has good points to be considered .
i know this clip is older , but i think he hits the nail on the head regarding most of the commentary shows .
it 's supposedly news satire , though amusingly it 's almost just as informative if not more than the actual news shows running these days .
obviously __name1__ has some political message of his own thrown in .
similar shows appear in other countries as people get sick of how every news talk show end up being either a pure propaganda 's machine for __quant1__ particular side or a bickering debate that does n't make sense to anyone .
__name1__ has a version , though it uses actors to cast as famous figures ( started mostly with political figures , but eventually ended up with pretty much all sorts of famous figures ) and they pretend to debate on a serious topic .
thursday there will be a vote on net neutrality ...
how do you feel about the __name1__ getting their hands on the internet ?
personally i have enjoyed the only place for actual free speech ...
do you want your internet censored ?
over my dead body ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!1
keep government away from the internet .
just read the actual law and the analysis .
this law is n't what it seems to be .
are they ever ?
the first rule of lawmaking is give the bill a name that is exactly the opposite of what it really does .
an emerging issue , how concerned are you over drug violence in __name1__ ?
what potential do you see for drug violence to spill over more into the __name1__ ?
do you believe it to be enough of a threat that necessitates the __name1__ to take more action to do something about it , and if so , what action should that be ? ( e.g . border fence/wall , training for the __name2__ police/military , monetary aid to the mexican government , etc.)
this poll is intended for __name1__ .
the drug violence in __name1__ started when the mexican president decided to " get tough " on the drug cartels .
guess what ?
they fought back .
just like the futile war on drugs in the __name2__ , the drug war in __name1__ will have no greater success .
fighting a war you can n't win is not noble .
it 's stupid .
stop fighting the war on drugs and the violence will go down .
we need to get the government out of the prohibition game once and for all .
legalize it , regulate it , and control it ( and tax it , too ! ) .
these drug killings are no different than __name1__ killing people during alcohol prohibition .
once drug dealing ( aka beer , wine , and liquor sales ) became legal and regulated , murders in __name1__ dropped dramatically .
plus we stopped locking people up because they wanted to get drunk .
there 's more about this on my cop in the hood blog .
recently i learned about __name1__ 's service plan , yeah may be late but better than never , and this is bothering me .
according to his website and other sources __quant2__ understand __name1__ 's might mandate __quant1__ hours of service per year when in college in exchange to $ __quant3__ of tuition credit .
to add this his chief of staff __name1__ has confirmed on __day1__ th __month1__ to draft a plan in this regard .
further the following is a quote form __name1__ 's book , the plan : big ideas for america ,
if they are just to be " asked ", then it sounds like a great deal .
though if it were , i see zero reason to limit it to college students age __quant1__ - __quant2__ . if it 's required it 's nothing more than a civil service draft , slavery .
might as well be forcing ' em to work the cotton ...
either way , good luck getting a bunch of drunk @/@ stoned college kids to add that workload to their college and job workloads .
as long as their just asking
imo its a fair price to pay .
this coming from someone that footed their own college tuition , no mommy and daddy allowences , no grants or anything else .
and it will keep them out of trouble and teach them some things as well .
imo a good call and for some perhaps a way to look at things in a much better perspective .
awesome , $ 40/hr , that 's more than what __quant1__ make .
lets ' see ... __quant1__ hours of service for $ __quant2__ credit .
so for a __quant2__ $ bailout , someone owes __quant1__ hours ?
thats if they do not mandate ... but if mandate ... that 's __name1__ ... that the first step ....
i think it is an excellent idea , people should be made aware of what to do in a crisis .
far to many people around the world today always expect someone to be there when a disaster strikes , especially natural disasters .
here in __name1__ everyone is taught how to cope and survive for up to at least __quant1__ days without assistance from outside .
i realize he is not in office yet ...
day 1 .
__name1__ to move missiles to __name2__ .
he 's already being tested .
i 'm sure the __name1__ want to gauge his reaction .
i cannot help but recall the age old expression that youth and enthusiasim is no match against wisdom and treachery .
__name1__ got some clout as being the president elect of the __name2__ but i shudder when he goes up against __name3__ .
was there a specific strike that stood out ?
what was __name1__ doing __year1__ @-@ __year2__ ?
__name1__ will have to do something over the top like the __quant1__ previous presidents before him did .
this savagery seems to be a requirement to prove one has the mettle to be " tough ."
nevermind that really being tough is working out a solution that does n't require bloodshed .
negotiating an end to __name4__ sanctions with the __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ .
as far __name1__ is concern , i would rather wait for his cabinet appointees ...
to make bold predictions on what __name1__ will do as president or what he will fail to do as president , one must wait to see who are the all the players .
would __name1__ have invaded __name2__ if it was not for the gang of __quant1__ ( __name3__ , __name4__ and __name5__ )?..
probably not , and probably __name1__ would have still be running the war in __name2__ as least had some influence there .
never mine , but a classic example of how " power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely "
then , you are consistent with your views , and there is merit in that .
perhapes , others from the other side of the aisle are only seeking consistency , as well .
i gave you an explanation as to why he did what he did ( in part thanks to us ) .
as an anti @-@ war person , of course what he did was horrible .
i would put it akin to napalm or cluster bombs .
the innocents are murdered in a savage manner .
why does the __name1__ need __quant1__ aircraft carriers ?
we do n't .
that 's why we only have 11 .
smart @-@ arse .
why does the __name1__ have __quant1__ carriers .
because 10 is not enough ?
how else can you muscle in on someone else 's turf ?
park a few carriers off the coast and make sure the despot does n't stray too far from the " __name1__ interest " angle .
you forgot we also have __quant1__ amphib carriers .
each one is as capable as any other carrier in the world . )
so it is in the papers today that the __name1__ family and the __name2__ family have met up at the __name3__ for a get together .
how does that go i want to know ?
does __name1__ walk around and whisper things to __name2__ like " see that security guard there ? thats ted .
do not make him mad ! !",
" careful this floor board squeaks ... cant sneak in late down this hallway "
or " theres a secret to get this door locked , see you have to push on the door while pulling upward ."
do the bushs show them around ?
are they just given a map and let loose ?
can they decorate however they want ?
lets say __name1__ wants teal shag carpeting in the oval office .... can he do that ?
could __name1__ have the hallways painted neon orange if she wanted ?
do the kids get to pick their own rooms ?
will they have to share a bathroom ?
will they have to use a computer in the main living area so they are not accessing naughty things on the internet ?
is the internet there blocked ?
could the __name1__ even access porn on the internet if they wanted ?
can the secret service hear things from the outside of the doors they are guarding ?
what if the __name1__ just have a personality conflict with a maid or something ?
can they just fire them at will and have a new one sent over ?
could they keep a pet giraffe on the grounds if they wanted to ?
if they wanted to get rid of the bowling alley and put in a discoteque could they do it ?
do they have to put a " do not disturb " sign on their bedroom door , or can they just lock it when they want some undisturbed time ?
and does the secret service knock and wait for an answer or just go charging into the bedrooms/bathrooms .
i wonder if they have ever " walked in " on a president .
there is this really nice site on the __name1__
very detailed info and pictures of most of the important rooms , spanning several eras .
i think this shows that pretty much every president can do any design thing they want with both the residence and the office wings
good questions .
i too would love to know the answers .
i hope someone can help !
as per __name1__ , the incoming first family get $ __quant1__ to do any changes to their living quarters of about __quant2__ room .
also , any change that they can do is after consultation with historians , since ostensibly any change they would do would become a part of the nation 's history
that does not seem much , especially after considering the extensive changes some previous presidents did .
not that i am complaining ; thats my tax dollars that 's funding those lavender curtains
looks like the __name1__ has already started hedging its bets for a possible defeat .
i am surprised at this .
surely this is not the time to write down your won candidate
also , i do n't agree with the tone of the article that __name1__ 's principled positions are costing his this election .
do you think far right parties like the __name1__ in the __name2__ should be accepted as representing a decent part of society or should they be viewed as hate filled bigots ?
many working class __name1__ feel that the __name3__ is no longer __name2__ due to too many immigrants .
is it racist to think this if you live in an area with more ethnics then brits like inner city __name1__ ?
what do others think ?
do far right parties deserve more respect or will they always be seen as bigots .
yes it is .
in order to afford to stay in inner city __name1__ , a person , probably along with his family , has to have a monthly income that supports this .
in order to do that a ethnic , has to have a stable job and thus already proving himself worthy . / rant over .
generally speaking the working @-@ class in a nation have negative views of immigrants because they 're at the economic margins and view immigrants as competition for scarce opportunities .
i do n't see anything wrong with the long @-@ term concerns on immigration that many in the __name1__ may hold , but reform can be carried out through the mainstream parties in __name2__ without having to resort to a racist @/@ __name3__ party .
if you 're concerned about immigration from the eu , then withdraw from the __name1__ .
it 's a racist @/@ __name1__ party .
it may have moderated its tune , but that 's what it is at its core .
failed coup has led to this trial with __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ government 's fingered .
going to be lots of fun on this one .
according to mannn the bosses were __name1__ and an ex @-@ __name2__ member of the cabinet .
guys this one is going to cause beeeg problems for a few of the fatcats .
not many arms dealers pay for helicopters for the " poor of __name1__ "
was it guilty conscience ?
will we ever find out the whole truth ?
i doubt it very much
i do remember __name1__ flying out and pulling every string she could to get him this . considering __name2__ got __quant1__ years and __name3__ won't see much less she saved his life .
thank __name1__ for the __name2__
we have all seen the stereotypes the frenchman defeated by germans in __name1__ ungrateful to the heroic __name2__ who had their back in ww2 or the snobby french people whole ignore tourists who speak __name3__
but __name1__ is the __name3__ contradiction of the __name2__ prejudiced views
__name2__ maybe a white __name1__ ex @-@ colonial __name3__ democracy but by no means are they right behind __name4__ or __name5__
when it comes to doing of thinking time and time again __name1__ has should the world
not all __name1__ nations is the follower of __name2__ as its is widely perceived
and i dont think the french will be demanding that the chinese govt suppress the demonstrations we have heard of in china
after all the __name1__ people are doing what tibetan monks and exiles were fighting for to do in tibet - freedom to protest
( though i must say the attacks on __name1__ people has taken a bit of credibility from the tibetan monks )
you know there is __quant1__ job __quant1__ do n't want this summer and that is the hcic security of the olympics .
rumour is now that __name1__ visitors are planning to protest during the olympics and considering the reaction today , we can expect a hell of a lot of __name2__ .
that would be extremely distracting when you 're on the look out for car bombs and __name1__ @-@ 47s .
did the __name1__ police state let __name2__ media see what was actually happening unlike in __name3__ ?
when rallies happen in __name1__ states they are rarely not state supported activities
yay for the __name3__ ... at least __quant1__ __name1__ democracy opposes __name2__ police states still .
the __name1__ were mostly only buying unlicensed copyright infringed copies of name brand french goods anyway .
if they stopped buying american dvds it would only mean licensed ones .
go on __name1__ they even sell the knock offs to us .
the uhygurs are mostly moslem and an ethnic minority in __name1__ with no self determination ruled by a __name2__ police state .
because some have joined extremist groups does not de @-@ legitmize the plight of an entire people .
i do n't under stand the problem people have with what was said by __name1__ .
in the __name2__ we have thought __name1__ regimes were thugs and goons since __name3__ in the __decade1__ s right ?
i think those ok with the __name1__ police state are really ok with the $ to be made there and they were never concerned about freedom only the spread of market capitalism .
the __name1__ were brilliant in adopting large scale no regulation market capitalism thereby co @-@ opting so many __name2__ who place capitalism and profit motive above a belief in democracy and freedom .
we really need to get out of bed with tyranny if we support freedom in the __name1__
or rather they do n't know how to use it .
the individual __name1__ has far more clout than the average __name2__ .
the number of posters here touting how good the __name1__ have it is testament to that .
the problem is that the majority of __name1__ are nowhere near the centres where that clout could benefit them .
they are in their little village .
yes , you may get __value1__ st seat at __name1__ with far lower grades ...
but you still have to study and go to __name1__ 1 st .
if you 're stuck in your village , you 're sol .
the other major problem is that because that very few __name1__ citizens who are knowledgeable enough to challenge the municipal governments are nowhere near the __name2__ .
even if the tibetans want to sue , they do n't know how and that opens up to corruption and abuse since they know the tibetans won't take them to court over it .
i will be attending a meeting with the veterans day parade committee .
we have a parade on or about __name1__ in __month1__ down atlantic avenue in __name2__ .
we have been doing this for several years now and have had many varied entrants including __name1__ prancer horses , re @-@ enactors in various uniforms ( including ww __name3__ and ww __name4__ __name2__ ) , cavalry units of various countries ( the ww __name4__ __name2__ cavalry " man " was actually a pretty girl using the helmet to hide her hair ) .
we had a problem last year in that a __name1__ group wanted to be part of our parade but we kept them out with the excuse that they only suddenly showed up and did not apply to be a unit .
this year we are being " asked " to include an anti @-@ war unit in the parade made up mostly of people protesting the war in __name1__ .
any ideas on this ?
besides the initial mistrust of " not believeing " they will not disrupt the parade , unless they are willing to sign a document stating they will honour the ones who gave the ultimate sacrifice , and give thanks to the ones who are currently fighting to ensure they " can have an opinion " and not in anyway disrupt the parade .... then i would say no they cannot join the parade .......
if they will sign said socument then welcome to the parade .
i would guess both groups want to politicise the event , which is after all to honour veterans , not make a political statement .
if they want a political rally , they can organise their own ,
if they want to participate as veterans then nobody 's stopping them from parading with their units .
if they are n't vets , it 's not their right to parade .
with the troubles in the world economy , and the pound rapidly losing value against the euro , is it time for the __name1__ to adopt the euro ?
what are the advantages of __name1__ adopting the euro , and what are the disadvantages ?
have the advantages or disadvantages changed with the current financial crisis ?
it 'll cost a lot to do it which would not be advisable at the current time with the economic situation not looking rosy ,
besides the people here would not stand for such a move .
so even if it made sense it would be political suicide to try and do it .
i just can n't imagine sitting in a restraunt and ordering a human steak !
i 'm not even sure this url thing is gonna work but it 's a story about scientists growing meat in a vat ( stem cell research ) .
from __name1__ science news friday __month1__ @/@ __day1__ @/@ 09 .
what do you think about this article/ if the url works ... let me know .
vat grown meat instead of factory farmed chicken/pork/beef ?
no more e.coli , __name1__ , anthrax or __name2__ to worry about .
seems like a good idea to me .
whats not to like ?
friend of mine in __name1__ has a whole cookbook full of recipes for long pig .
hell , i 'd try anything once , but if i change my mind , bet __name1__ would be right there with a fork and a knife !
on this the __value1__ th anniversary of the attack on __name1__ , we remember all those that are still entombed there and their shipmates !
we are here because they are there !
it seems as each year goes by , more and more lessons of history are forgotten !
our fearless leader 's children 's private school is observing the day by serving __name1__ food for lunch !
the __name1__ are observing this day as well by telling everyone that it never happened or we made them attack us because we would n't give them things .
if you ever get the chance to to watch the documentary about __name2__ and the other japanese atrocities during __name3__ you will be shocked to find a picture taken of a __name1__ private bayoneting a civilian and the interview with that very private saying he did n't do it as do many of the japanese soldiers who did things like this .
sorry , no love lost for the __name1__ .
the __name1__ was due to arrive yesterday however she was held off an additional day due to high winds in the area and will arrive today at the inactive ships reserve at the former __name2__ where she will reside for the next __quant1__ years in mothballs .
__quant1__ years of service to the __name1__ .
now it is only a matter of time before __name1__ retires and brings to an end the era of steam powered cv 's in the __name2__ .
they need to sell her for scrap and get rid of that floating wreck .
why waste money maintaining a ship that was in such bad shape , she could n't conduct air ops before they decommissioned her ?
curious in part about how so many of the carriers got to be in . " poor material condition "
i 'm just confused about the posibility of this happening can someone explain it to me ?
secondly wow has scrapping and breaking gotten to be so expensive that its considered better @/@ more cost effective to do a sink @-@ ex wierd .
thats a massive amount of proccessed metal .
as more and more ships are built , the scrappers have more and more ships to scrap .
simply put , the scrappers are falling behind .
shipyards appear as manufacturing plants ,
scrappers appears as junk yards .
plus there is glory in building wonderful ships , there is no glory tearing the ships apart .
special occasions such as keel laying , ship christening , and commissioning ceremonies deal with shipbuilding , no ceremonies for scrapping .
when you go to a store to buy a new shiny mop bucket , you feel happy to do so .
you feel lucky when you receive a new shiny roll of pennies from the bank , you frown when its the old rusty roll of pennies .
when you discard the rusty old mop bucket , you do n't feel sorry to do so . its people oriented too .
since carriers costs so much , they are kept in service longer .
many are of the age of old monochrome television sets , or in the early days of color television sets , you know the ones without remote control .
you would n't think of buying a television without remote control today .
they are so old , they do n't make them any more .
with the carriers , they received their mid @-@ life refits upgrading their electronics and electrical motors .
they have also received their service life extension programs too , upgrading or replacing their larger machinery components .
how many of us still have a __year1__ s vintage refrigerator , washer and dryers , dishwashers , televisions , automobiles , hot water tanks , ranges and ovens , etc.
__name1__ offers warships to __name2__ for __value1__ time
interesting in that the __name1__ is planning to prematurely decommission its __name2__ class mine @-@ hunting ships .
as regards amphibious ships the __name1__ wants desperately to decommission its steam @-@ powered __name2__ class ( __name3__ will actually be decommissioned this fall ) .
these ships will soon start turning __quant1__ years old with no slep being undertaken .
it is also said they have aged much quicker than anticipated .
the __name1__ poured a ton of money into the __name2__ class ships to keep them going for __quant2__ years ( in some cases it will be __quant2__ plus ) w/o a slep .
they dont want to repeat the experience .
eventually thsi may leave only eight __name1__ class ships until and if lha( r ) class ships get built .
also the __name1__ class will be trucated at __quant1__ ships imho( some say seven others nine and nine have already been named ) .
this would also open up the possibility of prematurely decommissioning ships as many as four __name1__ class ships now turning __quant1__ years old .
selling __quant1__ __name1__ class ( plus granting __quant3__ others as spares hulks ) and __quant2__ __name2__ class ships to __name3__ is intriguing imho .
this would give __name1__ a ready @-@ made credible amphibious force for very little cost .
with the demise of the battleships almost a certainty and only a handful , if any , of the __name1__ class ships to be built( plus the truncated __name2__ program ) the __name3__ is poised to cut its amphibious forces by 1 @/@ 3 .
the __name1__ is also attempting to fast @-@ track its seabasing platforms which theoretically would make @-@ up for the draw @-@ down in legacy amphibious warfare platforms .
more on that sometime in the future .
just my analysis of the situation based on what is available from open sources .
it is a good start because it adds a whole dimension to the indian armed forces ....
can land forces through these transports anywhere in the __name1__ ...
yeah , but i dont think it make that much of a difference ... since we already have plenty of large landing ships ... which we can manufacture indiginously if necessary .
the landing ship is something we can do without .
it is a very old decrepit ship that needs a huge major overhaul to bring it up to today 's standards .
__name1__ would be better off buying a new ship with that kind of money .
__name1__ is buying ship __name2__ ( lpd @-@ 14 ) .
not because of its war making capability .
but to move humanetarian aids in asian region like in case of tsunami .
__name1__ do not have big transport ship like __name2__ which can land material on sea beaches etc.
it only has magars class landing ships . so if __name1__ get this ship , then i think it is ok .
at least it will get a cheap ship for doing mostly humaneterian work .
war making will be secondary work for this ship .
and this is the only reason that americans have suddenly agreed to supply __name1__ this particular ship .
regarding agis radars .
it is a seperate item .
why are you discussing it on this thread .
__value1__ let us buy this ship , then we can discuss others .
this is what happens when you take shipboard safety for granted .
tanks are always dangerous .
ive been in many and hated every second of it .
i got derided and laughed at alot for the seemingly overcaustiousness i always undertook .
people die if you dont .
i preferred not to die thisway.:
tanks are very dangerous places .
we were always taught in first aid @/@ rescue never to enter a tank if there was someone unconsious inside ...
cause you would be next .
unnecessary tragedy .
__quant1__ read a story relating to the cleaner trychlrothylene used to clean a tank in the rn back inthe 70 s , the guy was around it too long that his mylenin ( the fatty cover around the spine ) was eaten away by it and he went bonkers for a few hours and then died .
hell you have to take alot of caution when you are working in closed areas with noxious fumes , even building models you can get messed up off the paints if you dont have an open window .
yanks out , bombers in , __quant1__ bombs , dozens killed , control battle starts , sunnis v shites , __quant3__ of dollars @/@ pounds spent , lives lost , for what , for sweet fuck all that 's what ,
__name1__ forces have no chance of controlling ,
__name1__ is gonna get worse now than before the __name2__ tried to make it better
the innocents are gonna suffer just like before .
lets get out of ag as well leave the village tribal idiots to it .
if push comes to shove , slash n burn , waste no more lives n cash on useless campaign 's . imo
does this surprise anyone ? excluding our glorious leaders of course
imo , the __name1__ 's screwed themselves by giving into the sadrists and others .
as mentioned before the __name1__ should have punched his ticket and his army of idots before departing __name2__ .
once again politics interviened and spared their sorry ass .
this is what they get in return for that stupid decision .
the large " gray area " knows no boundries . and once you let religion into politics instead of keeping them seperate the black and white disappears depending upon who you are and only gray exists .
a very dismal commentary .
there is no doubt that repeated deployment in the combat zone does wear out individuals . it does lead to whole lot of man management and domestic problems .
and it does create innumerable problems for the govt which has to maintain its aim and deliver .
a __name1__ situation .
that the troops are still managing speaks very highly of their dedication and patriotism and they should be commended .
to overcome this problem , one way could be draft .
but that would be a political suicide .
also , a draft will not guarantee that the soldiers would be better .
in fact , many misfits would be in , leading to greater problems as was seen in __name1__ .
one of the solution is to have a volunteer force of all nationalities like the __name1__ ( being discussed elsewhere in the forum ) .
all said and done , a difficult situation indeed , but the national aim cannot be forsaken !
it 's just one person 's point @-@ of @-@ view , but from what i can tell , there 's lots of fight left in these guys .
__quant1__ 'm around __name1__ 's warriors all day every day , and __quant1__ can tell you that they do n't seem tired and worn out to me .
__quant1__ stat __quant1__ keep seeing thrown around is the approval @/@ disapproval rating of how the war is being conducted .
but if only one third of the troops like the way we 're going about the business of winning in __name1__ , that does not necessarily mean they 've lost faith in the mission .
hell , as for myself , i 'm not crazy about how we 're proceeding , either .
but that does n't mean i do n't believe in the mission .
far from it - i want to go at the job harder . i want to win .
i want the surge to be bigger , sooner , and to last as long as it takes to win .
so , although it 's only my perspective here and backed by absolutely no numbers , stats or facts other than what i know from personal observation , i simply do not see the impending crash coming .
what i can tell you that i do see is a frustrated will to victory , and a sense that our leaders and people are not as committed as we are .
bluesman , this repeated turnover and its effect i understand to some degree since we ( __name1__ infantry units ) are always back in the ci grid after every __quant1__ years .
if we were sent without this break , i am sure we would have got really fed up .
as it is , we have started having problems inspite of this __quant1__ year layover in peace stations , since the standard of living has gone up and our troops are getting urbanised and soft .
we also have the advantage that we are from the same unit for life in most cases and so the cohesiveness is more and we know each other well .
i believe in the __name1__ , soldiers can be posted to any unit .
what is the time gap between turn over for __name1__ ?
you 'd have to work around them to truly understand what i mean .
otherwise , i just do n't think you 'd really be able to see it the way i do .
in my job , i work with all the inter @-@ agency players , and i never experience the kind of inertia and drag with anybody else .
this is absolutely the truth : the __name1__ wonks down here do not want to be associated with the word ' __value1__ ', as in my branch 's mission of ' capture or kill enemy high @-@ value individuals '.
that 's what we attempt to do ; that 's what they want no part of .
and you 'd have to be here to know what it is to be frustrated and impeded by people that vehemently object to your very existence .
i wish i could express it in a way that you would know what i mean .
( you probably think i 'm just impatient with bureaucracy , which i am , or that it 's a squabble about methods , and there 's certainly those , too .
but it 's more than that .)
then , i think , you would not think it too strident to say they have an antipathy toward an __name1__ victory .
bluesman , i have n't worked inter @-@ agency , so i trust you know best .
however , in their defense , i would like to mention that
1 . the pinstripers have n't been exactly beloved or respected by the __name1__ administration .
some of this is fair ( __name1__ was all but ignored in __year1__ ) , some of this is not ( bureaucratic irritation at the initiatives kicking them out of comfortable perches and into __name2__ hotspots ) .
2 . __name1__ has got plenty of ex @-@ military , and there 's enormous pressure to get more .
i trust that i break no state secrets by telling you that if you head over to __name1__ , you will see a lot of __quant1__ @-@ somethings and lots of __quant2__ @-@ year old senior staff , and not much in between . the lack of a middle is really making ' em push for ex @-@ military to fill that .
i can assure you that patriotism is high up on their values , more so than ever .
i 'll try to explain my perspective on all this .
it might ramble at times .
i was for the war , still am if it could be fought properly , but it can n't be .
__name1__ 's goal is a secure __name2__ , with a functioning gov't that can police the country and be an __name3__ ally in the __name4__ .
this will not happen .
my knowledge is all __value1__ hand , but that 's all i have to go on .
i 'm seeing a picture of a nation of subhuman savages .
did anyone ever bother to ask why __name1__ did the things he was hung for ?
we 're seeing the answer to that question .
these people need a dictator who 's willing to use mass murder when they step out of line .
unfortunately we are n't prepared to use similar tactics , so this war is unwinnable .
if it was up to me , everytime an ied goes off we 'd get our people out , draw a circle on a map with at least a 500m radius around the point of the blast , and turn that area into a smoking crater .
and i do n't care if there 's a school full of kids there with classes in session .
do that a few times and these " people " might start to behave better .
we can surge troops all we want , but if the level of cruelty does n't increase it will all be pointless .
that 's the only thing they understand .
i can n't believe i was stupid enough to buy all the tripe about what __name1__ could become if we just remove the dictator .
i also have some problems with __name1__ that i did n't have when i voted for him , based on his piss poor performance .
he 's recently changed policy to go after the __name1__ agents that are supplying the militias .
we 've seen stories that the __name1__ has been tracking these __name2__ for over __quant1__ years .
why change now ?
why did n't we whack them as soon as they were identified ? ??
how many __name3__ are dead or maimed because __name1__ was playing some diplomatic footsy game with __name2__ ?
there are __quant1__ of our border agents in prison for doing their jobs , and __quant2__ marines sitting in jail in __name2__ for hitting the wrong house after they were attacked in __name1__ .
__name1__ has n't lifted a finger to help either of those groups of men , and that 's why imo bush has shown himself to be nothing but an honorless pig .
can someone talk me out of this ?
because it 's looking pretty damn bleak to me .
ieds : the lazy man 's insurgency
it 's time to take another look at __name1__ , because there 's been a big change in insurgent tactics in __year1__ . that 's inevitable . war makes people on both sides think faster . peacetime armies never learn anything ; wartime armies learn new tricks faster than a hungry raccoon .
the big change is that the insurgents have decided to rely on ieds rather than ambushes with shoulder @-@ fired weapons to kill the two or three gis per day they figure they need to wear down the __name1__ public 's will to stay in the fight . and it 's working , way too well .
the stats are clear : ied victims make up a bigger chunk of our casualties every month . over the last __quant1__ months , ieds have caused __value1__ % of __name1__ combat deaths . last month ( __month1__ __year1__ ) was typical : out of __quant3__ __name2__ troops killed , ieds were responsible for __quant2__ .
compare that with __month1__ __year1__ , a terrible month when we lost __quant1__ troops . back then the insurgents relied on rpgs and small arms . only __quant2__ of our __quant3__ kia that month @-@ barely more than a __value1__ @-@ were killed by ieds .
the insurgents have decided to do it the easy way . as long as they can use ieds , their low @-@ tech standoff weapon , why should they risk close combat ?
the real question is why they can get away with it . and here @-@ well , i hate to keep saying this , but somebody needs to . the reason they can do it is because we still have no intel on them . it 's the biggest failure of the war , and nobody talks about it . ci warfare is about people , not hardware . we 're all hardware and no intelligence , like a __name1__ show . makes me sick .
that makes the decision to go with ieds a no @-@ brainer for the insurgents . in the standard ambush , the kind we were facing __quant1__ year ago , the insurgents detonated an ied under a convoy , then opened up on the stalled survivors with rpg and small arms fire . it probably made them feel good , sort of their version of shock and awe , but the rifle fire was ineffective and by concentrating their forces , the insurgents made themselves vulnerable to our air power .
the problem in any guerrilla battle is the getaway . anybody can pull a trigger ; the trick is getting your men home safe , while enemy choppers zoom through the sky and every street is full of troops and armor looking for men of military age . that 's the tough part .
an ied ambush has none of those risks . only __quant1__ man needs to be on the spot @-@ the triggerman . he detonates the ied from a car parked down a side street and drives away before the occupiers can even start their search . no risk . no casualties . very demoralizing for the occupiers , especially since they know damn well that everybody in the neighborhood was in on the attack but they can n't level the locals ' shacks like they 're dying to .
what makes this wave of ieds worse is that the devices are getting more effective . frankly i 've been shocked at how good the __name1__ are with these things right from the start . i mean , after that shameful performance in __name2__ , did you expect these bastards to be so sneaky , patient , and smart ? i knew this war was a bad idea , but even i never realized what we 'd be up against .
the scariest tech development of all is that the insurgents have learned how to make shaped @-@ charged ieds . to understand why shaped charges are such a powerful weapon , we have to go into the incredibly cool world of explosive physics . i love this stuff . i mean , what red @-@ blooded __name1__ boy did n't experiment with explosives ? the only reason i ever opened my chem book was to see if it mentioned tnt or dynamite in the index . ( it did n't @-@ goddamn hippie teachers.) and naturally i used the local wildlife , like toads and bees , in my experiments with the killing power of firecrackers .
what __quant1__ learned was the most important point about the subject : blast alone does n't do a good job of killing the target . a bee would wobble off unhurt after __quant1__ of my __day1__ th of __month1__ daisycutters went off right next to it .
now before you hotheads whose hobby is making pipe bombs in the garage write me angry letters ( or send me long round packages with no return address ) , i know a blast can kill , if it 's a big enough blast . we had a really nasty example of that in __month1__ this year , when a huge ied killed __quant1__ __name1__ near __name2__ . from what i 've read , investigation showed there was nothing special about the ied . it was just __quant2__ anti @-@ tank mines stacked in a pile @-@ the __name3__ of ieds , i guess you could call it .
that ambush showed real clearly how important intelligence is in guerrilla warfare . the same unit that suffered the ied attack had just had __quant1__ of its snipers killed in a small @-@ arms ambush . now you tell me how anybody can ambush __quant2__ snipers unless they 've completely penetrated the unit . the insurgents knew where the unit 's snipers would assemble , and they knew where the vehicle would be passing . we do n't know a thing about the enemy , but it 's clear that he knows way too much about us .
the other problem is that the __quant1__ __name3__ were riding in __quant2__ of those ridiculous landing crafts the __name4__ uses as apcs @-@ in __name2__ , __quant3__ of clicks from the sea ! it 's called the __name1__ @-@ __name1__ , and it looks like a giant armored dinghy . since it was designed to ferry troops ashore , it sacrifices armor and speed and damn near everything else to an amphibious capability that has no use anymore . but that 's the __name4__ for you . real brave , but not always real smart .
maybe if those guys had been in a real apc some would have survived . i can n't say . if the blast is big enough , it can kill even an mbt . the pals took out __quant1__ __name1__ merkavas , the best @-@ armored tanks in the world , with simple blast ieds .
but most of the time , guerrillas do n't have the delivery systems to depend on blast power . if they 're trying to kill soft targets @-@ i.e . people @-@ they pack the bomb with homemade shrapnel : roofing nails , ball bearings , anything that 'll shred flesh . a suicide vest tipped with nails is basically a __quant2__ @-@ degree __quant1__ gauge .
to kill gis that way , you need to catch them off @-@ guard , somewhere they feel safe . that 's what happened when a jihadi killed more than a dozen of our guys in a mess hall in __name1__ while they were having lunch -- minus their body armor .
in the field , __name1__ troops are a hard kill , especially because they move in armored convoys protected by choppers . and that 's the real beauty of ied attacks for a guerrilla : they absolutely nullify __name2__ air power . there are literally no targets for the attack choppers . the pilots know damn well that __quant1__ of those __name3__ cars driving away from the scene is carrying the guy who set off the ied , but there 's no way to tell which __quant1__ .
in a strange way , we 're looking at a __quant1__ war . we control the air , but the __name1__ literally control the underground , thanks to these buried ieds . we fly , they dig .
the insurgents ' first ieds were simple . not that there 's anything wrong with simple . the weapons that have been hurting us are all simple , like the rpg . simplicity is the guerrilla 's friend .
those early ieds were usually just shells buried by the road , wired up to a detonator . lots of amateurs were tinkering in their garages , or whatever __name1__ have instead of garages , playing with stuff that goes boom . and naturally lots of those guys went boom themselves .
like i said , war teaches people fast , but some of the lessons have to be learned by the next of kin , not the handyman whose bright idea for a new type of bomb turned him into an abstract painting all over his wall .
sometimes an insurgency has to learn its lessons several times . take the case of pressure @-@ triggered ieds . these are basically standard anti @-@ vehicle mines , with something like a bathroom scale as trigger . people and cars can pass over them unharmed , but if a really heavy ( meaning armored ) vehicle rolls over that scale , the bomb goes off . ( trucks are a problem . some trucks weigh as much as an apc.) the best part is that you do n't even need a triggerman to set it off . you can all be off at the hookah parlor polishing up your alibis when it goes off .
the insurgents in __name1__ used pressure bombs in __year1__ , but they usually failed to go off . their bombmakers did n't have the technique yet .
thanks to info @-@ sharing , the internet gives an insurgency , they 're back at it , with better wiring diagrams . __quant1__ week ago ( __month1__ . __day1__ ' 05 ) , a pressure bomb shredded a __name1__ in __name2__ , tearing __quant2__ gis legs to pieces .
the first ieds were mostly mortar rounds that failed against our armor . so the insurgents went to big __quant1__ mm rounds . that 's a big , big shell and when you trigger it at the right moment , it 's going to kill almost anything but an __name1__ .
the __name1__ is a great tank , so it 's kind of scary to read the stats on how many of them the insurgents have managed to knock out . as usual , the invasion was the easy part and the occupation was when things got lethal . we only lost __quant1__ m1s in the conventional fighting , but the guerrillas have since managed to disable __quant2__ . now most of those are track damage , but that 's enough to put a tank out of action .
the good news is that the __name5__ has lived up to its rep for crew protection . the __name2__ 's __name1__ says only __quant1__ crew have died in ied attacks on m1s . ( __quant2__ other __name4__ crew have been killed , mostly by sniper fire , riding in open hatches .)
so if you 're an insurgent bomb @-@ maker , your goal is to find a way to kill m1s . not just knock a tread off , but destroy it and kill the crew . and that 's where the shaped @-@ charge ied comes in . shaped charges were developed for tank killing , used in mbt anti @-@ armor rounds and antitank weapons . their warheads are basically thick cups of soft metal . metals with low melting points , usually copper . the bomb @-@ maker 's job is to make sure as much of the force of the blast is channeled to the copper cone as possible . so sometimes he 'll put several __quant1__ mm shells beneath the copper , or pack a whole lot of tnt under it .
when the ied detonates , this copper cup turns into a shaft of superheated metal that can zip right through any armor , even an __name1__ 's . that 's what they tell me , and i have to believe it .
it 's the kind of weird science that used to frustrate me in physics , the sort of info you just have to take on faith . i can n't help wondering if they 're kidding us civvies about it all . i do n't get why a soft metal like copper can penetrate __name1__ armor , which can defeat almost any warhead around .
apparently the copper is n't even actually molten . it ejects as a solid ; it just " behaves like molten metal." i 'm sure the insurgent __name1__ tinkerers do n't understand the science involved any more than i do . they just hear that it works and try it out .
the __name1__ countermeasures have been pretty lame so far . convoys travel with jammers that make it harder to detonate the ied by cell phone or garage door opener @-@ __name2__ and __name3__ sales are going to drop in the __name4__ . but like i said , low @-@ tech is the guerrilla 's friend . these days they 've gone back to wires , and i hear some are even using string . you can n't jam a string .
beyond that , __name1__ policy is to blame __name2__ , or __name3__ , or __name4__ or whoever .
__name3__ ? maybe . __name1__ ? no way . __name1__ 's scared to death , ready to do anything to make __name2__ happy . and if it is __name7__ , what can we do about it ? there are still a few neocons so totally out of their little gourds they want us to invade __name7__ . i have to wonder if they 're agents of dr __name5__ , programmed to destroy __name6__ . because invading __name7__ would do it , it 'd end us once and for all .
this blame stuff is a sign of frustration . nobody knows how to stop ieds , even with all the __name1__ geeks sending in their garage @-@ tech brainstorms . that 's because @-@ damn , how many times do i have to repeat it ? -guerrilla war has no technical solution . or even military solution . the only effective ci techniques are torture , reprisal and , ultimately , genocide .
my guess is that genocide will come back one day . that was how the ancients dealt with rebellious towns : wiped ' em out . one of these days some first @-@ world country is going to get impatient and a problem child like the __name1__ will be a big , radioactive ghost town .
if we do n't do it , the kurds may end up doing it the old @-@ fashioned way they learned from the turks : __quant1__ bullet , __quant2__ village at a time . it 's been done before -- seen any __name1__ up there lately ? probably not , but most of " __name4__ " used to be " armenia." a few of the __name1__ made it to __name2__ , but the rest are buried up there .
we 're talking about __name1__ here , the place where war was invented . hundreds of peoples have been wiped out forever in those parts . all these __name2__ lobbyists get furious if anybody says __name3__ are n't the only tribe to get genocided , but that 's just politics-" our genocide is better than your genocide ! "
the fact is , genocide is , historically , the most common result when one tribe runs into another . and something tells me the next big wipeout will happen right there in central __name1__ .
it has a large sky is falling slat but decent read on the ieds ...
it is true that the ieds are effective .
it is not a " lazy man 's insurgency " but a " cunning and diabolical man 's insurgency "
raj ,
sorry , as i stated , i did n't have much time , but the wife now has the newborn .
a few superficial criticisms :
1 . it 's not ci ( counter @-@ intelligence ) . ci is when you thwart your enemy 's intel operations . thus , gaining intel on when @/@ where the insurgents are planting ieds is intel , not counter @-@ intel .
2 . iraqis do n't have garages at their houses . thus , i would conclude that this guy has never stepped foot in __name2__ .
some meaty criticisms :
1 . the __name2__ 's __name1__ is as armored as the standard __name4__ apc - the __name3__ . it sounds as if this pundit is probably a former __name5__ guy . based on the damage to the single __name6__ that was involved , unless it were a m @-@ 1 , more armor would n't have helped . that 's how big the ieds are getting .
2 . a single __quant1__ mm round does n't do any significant damage to __name1__ armored vehicles ( the up @-@ armored __name2__ is n't a true armored vehicle in the sense that it was designed from the ground up with armor in mind - it was modified from a cargo vehicle ) . for example , on the __name3__ , a __quant2__ mm round will scratch some paint off and flatten tires .
3 . war is like a sport . it is interactive and tactics , techniques , and procedures evolve continuously in reaction to your opponent . back to the sports analogy , if you 're getting killed in a zone defense , you switch to man @-@ to @-@ man , etc. he seems to apply a template that the enemies of the __name1__ should be dumb and not react . underestimating your enemy is a bad and dumb thing to do .
4 . he fails to mention the intel that we get that allows us to defuse the majority of ieds before they are detonated .
5 . he fails to mention how switching back to wired devices makes it easier to catch the trigger man .
6 . he fails to mention how using larger devices means that you need to spend more time preparing the site , which means a greater chance of compromise .
7 . he complains about intel , but then advocates harsh techniques that run contrary to the values of the __name1__ and does n't weigh the impact that these techniques would have on gaining intel from the population and @/@ or bringing the population off the fence and to our side . his recommendations would result is less intelligence - gaining some information from a paid triggerman may result in a few short @-@ term successes within a particular cell , but it will alienate the population and result is less intel over the long @-@ run from the population and future cells that would be created down the road due the increased perception of occupation through the harsh techniques he advocates . as an example , __name2__ , which was the direct result of a half @-@ dozen irresponsible individuals that were able to conduct their abuses due to the lacking leadership of their supervisors , had a huge negative impact on our relations with local __name3__ . the trust we had built with many was eroded and our ability to gain trust with others was much more challenging .
bottomline , he does n't truly analyze the situation from all aspects and uses some faulty assumptions and some facts that are flat out wrong . in the end , you have the action @-@ reaction @-@ counteraction cycle that is producing bigger ieds that are easier to catch , but more deadly if you do n't catch it . i 'm not stating that it 's not a problem , but this analysis does n't offer much value .
i hope this helps . as far approaches to coin , i 'm sure that ray , lemontree , dave angel , and some of the others on this board whose militaries have been doing coin for much longer than the __name1__ ( which , btw has done coin quite frequently , but then shuns it as a freak occurance and does n't internalize the lessons learned in favor on focusing on the " big threat ") can comment at length on why this article espouses the wrong approach to the problem .
i 'm just wondering what __name1__ posters think your government 's reaction would be if __name2__ asked for finished nuclear weapons and missiles , plus nuclear know how , with you for under the table shipments of yellowcake for your nuclear weapons program ?
you see , i 'm hoping that __quant1__ day befor it is too late that __name1__ will wake up to the fact that we can n't rely on the us to be willing to lose a city over us by holding true on the ' nuclear umbrella ', if ever we had a conflict with __name2__ .
by shipping you yellowcake from say a secret source on defence land acqured for ' training ', we could keep it outside the __name1__ inspection treaty process so you can build bombs with it .
we ould even fly in vetted __name1__ miners ( with training ) to avoid the secret getting out here . it would benefit us by allowing payments to be made outside our budget approprations process , which is transparent .
once we have our missiles we can announce that we are joining you in the non @-@ aligned movement , transport weapons grade uranium between us openly and generally ignore all the complaints it would generate and other peoples wars , just like you do now .
does this work for you ?
it would n't be that hard for __name1__ to build nukes by yourselves .
involving outsiders usually increases the amount of headaches you have to deal with .
imo , every " __value1__ world " - technologically modern nation could probably do it today - some have chosen not to ( like __name1__ and __name2__ ) perhaps because of history ?
i think __name1__ probably could do it if they wanted too , and the rest of the world would n't object as much as they would if __quant1__ of the historically agressive non @-@ nuclear nations did it .
a lot of the nuclear weapons tech that was unattainabe __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ years ago is attaintable now . it would be very expensive , and there would be consequences .
why should we sell ?
the only reasons we would were if we really needed the money or if the yellowcake were not available elsewhere or if you were the only ones who had something we really needed from an existential perspective as barter .
it could and would probably work if india were to place their own nukes under indian control onto __name1__ soil .
for your defense and our own .
expanding deterrent .
but then you have that option already with the __name1__ , so the fact that you ask this question probably points to a drift in confidence or the fact that you feel you would be able to better control an __name2__ nuke umbrella to your prime advantage versus a __name1__ one .
tired of the ever @-@ hulking , always @-@ advancing glacier of dvd and bd cases in my living room , i 've procured a media server and a __name1__ box to run it .
my plan is to migrate all of my media ( probably about 700 dvds and bds , counting __quant1__ the tv shows i have ) onto the server over the next year or so , and banish the hardcopy to a closet for backup .
media server with 6tb storage running __name1__ lives in the basement , __name2__ box hooked into __name3__ stack ( plasma , bd player , cd player , cable box , receiver ) lives upstairs , __name4__ @-@ __name4__ network .
so far i 'm getting great quality playback from some items , but real movies that i 've ripped are not great .
i 've played with a few different programs , but i like __name1__ the most so far .
does anyone know if it 's really a " bit - to - bit clone ", or am i getting some default compression even if i 've set that to __value1__ % ? -@ dale
if there 's a visible difference between the dvd and the copy then it 's being compressed .
sometimes the format you decide to convert it to has issues .
i seldom do it so i 'm not really au fait with what is good but the software i use is handbrake and convert it to either.mov files or uncompressed mpeg4
nifty thread .
i am thinking of implementing a rather lower cost option .
manually rip all dvds to mkvs , make a little htpc with a low cost __name1__ cpu and a wireless card and hook it up to my tv .
for any gamers out there.. the rumor thread for " __name1__ "..
what the game would be like ?
so far its a split between semi @-@ scifi( __name1__ ) or literally modernwarfare2( __name2__ ) with new maps and missions..
__name1__ was a disappointment when they decided to go back to the same old __name2__ theme..
i 'd personally prefer them adding new maps and missions to __name1__ ...
__name1__ to me was the best real @-@ war based fps ...
maybe more ' politically bold missions ' like __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , nwfp/waziristan..maybe even cuba/n.korea..
just hope they dont overdo the __name1__ @-@ __name1__ theme which they pulled off so well in __name2__
if it is " semi @-@ scifi "( they 're rumored to be looking for a sci @-@ fi title ) ..
i 'm stumped..
how 'd they possibly pull @-@ off semi scifi without looking like a bad copy of halo..
they should do some type of geurilla warfare game set in a wartorn __name1__ or __name2__ country .
that could be interesting , like a fps contra .
i hope they make the plot as interesting as the last one .
somilian pirates @/@ mexican drug cartels would bore the hell out of me .
ps : __name1__ was pretty good .
i do n't know why people hate it so much .
__name1__ - __quant1__ word - awesome ! !!...
the trailer looks great .
plus i got what i wanted - an extension of __name1__ instead of yet another __name2__ scenario .
looks like they packed a lot more missions into __name1__ compared to __name2__ .
i am so looking forward to __month1__ !
this is so much better than last year when i saw the __name1__ trailer ( flamethrowers and all ) and all i could think of was - " oh dear..."
since many of our troops are stuck in __name2__ , it is likely that we may not have the resources to be able to send troops to __name1__ .
so there is great likelihood that __name1__ may act alone .
although israel has greater air and ground superiority then __name1__ , __name1__ has larger numbers of troops and have long range missles that can reach __name2__ .
__name1__ in the past has sucessfully fought off nations with larger numbers of troops before a prime example being the six day __name2__ .
so would __name1__ be able to act alone or would __name2__ military intervention still be required to attack __name3__ ?
__name1__ would find it hard enough to conduct air raids on __name2__ , let alone fighting a large scale war .
the distances are simply too great for __name1__ to be able to project much power against __name2__ .
i do n't think __name1__ could act alone .
if they attacked __name1__ unilaterally , it would probably be a large mission aimed at taking out __name1__ 's nuclear infrastructure .
they would have a hard go of it .
__name1__ in retaliation would launch its long range missiles at __name2__ , as well as encouraging __name3__ to harass israel .
i think any __name1__ action against __name2__ would involve bringing the __name3__ into the war , i think its the only way __name4__ can really do enough damage to make the whole effort worthwhile .
i have been searching for sometime now , and i can n't seem to find a dropshipper that sales merchandise low enough so i could profit from it .
would someone please help me ?
hi , nobody is going to give you their sources .
you are going to have to find them on your own .
there are plenty out there but most of them are more trouble than they are worth .
there are also a very few that are good suppliers but you have to realize , when dropshipping , the profit margin is very thin and you have to be on top of them all the time , monitoring their inventory .
people find a dropshipper , sign up and then list , list , and list !
they list soooo much but then when it comes to monitoring the inventory they do not check back into the site to see if the inventory is still available .
you can have a successful business with dropshippers but it is w*o*r*k .
it is not e*a*s*y .
i found all my sources by surfing the net on my cellphone during commercials , while waiting in line , any spare moment .
search several different ways , most do not even have the word " dropship " on their site .
good luck .
and beware of " membership clubs " such as doba and the like .
they are not your solution .
real distributors do not charge you for taking your money .
still , making any drop shipping work in the dsr @-@ feedback @-@ oriented quick ship ebay world will be a challenge .
please do a quick search and you will find tons of info on drop shipping ... here is a thread from the recent past __value1__
which is only of about 25+ since the beginning of the year .
i am sorry but until __name1__ pins the drop shipping topic all you can do is search older posts .
i cannot give you the formula for success , but i can give you the formula for failure -- which is : try to please everybody . __name1__
my partners and i refuse to use dropshipping .
if a dropshipper has __quant3__ items for example and we sell __quant5__ to __quant5__ different people then we have __quant1__ potential unhappy customers with the potential for __quant2__ negative feedbacks .
a dropshipper is only concerned with selling their __quant1__ items as fast as they can .
i am concerned with selling the __quant1__ items that are in our inventory as best and correctly as possible .
this is just my opinion .....
ok ... i know the answer to that but it still really bothers me .
this is what was waiting for me when i logged into __name1__ this afternoon
no ! __name1__ should issue a coupon for buyers to use on our listings and get __value1__ % off ....
we would still get our full $$ and __name1__ can give the seller the difference that the buyer saves !
just really bugs me
because that is additional revenue outside of seller .
seller are captive revenue that will be about the same no matter what they do ,
until someone else come along and challenge ebay they will keep on doing the same thing , but soon or later that will happen , , , ......... i hope sooner
, ...,most people do n't realize that the best answer are the one that they do n't want to hear . chan
yup..i knew the answer but still hate it !
sorry , long story .
first off a little info..
__name1__ has been one of the leading guitar amplifier companies for __quant1__ years .
many of the older amps are being restored and also there are countless companies offering clones and cloned replacement parts for diy'ers .
since i like wood working i thought some folks would enjoy an amplifier shell that they could finish themselves and either use it to restore an old __name1__ amplifier or to collect aftermarket parts from countless other vendors and end up with a vintage marshall clone .
so , i have had pretty good luck selling these wooden amp head shells in the past and thought i would reintroduce my product .
well , __name1__ pulled my listing for having the word " __name2__ " in the title .
my actual listing read " __name1__ style plexi @/@ __name2__ headshell for project ."
notice the word " style ".
i did a quick __name1__ search using " __name2__ style " and came up with __quant1__ 's of listings that use that term for after market parts and kits .
the listings i clicked on were not actaul __name1__ products .
i also searched another famous amplifier company and typed in " __name1__ style ".
again __quant1__ 's of listings for aftermarket parts and kits .
why was i singled out when there are 1,000 's and 1,000 's of people listing this way ?
and its clear that i did not claim it was an actual " __name1__ " product which is why i put the word " style " in the listing .
does not seem right .
people who are looking for these items won't find them without knowing that it is for a __name1__ or marshall style amp .
i love the smell of packaging tape in the morning .
can n't use the manufacturer 's name in the title unless the item being listed is actually made by the manufacturer .
__name1__ rules - not mine .
michael 's right - someone somewhere decided to report you , and you ended up getting a wrist @-@ slap .
you -@ could @- start reporting all the " style " listings you found and ( hopefully ) watch them go away .
sometimes it only takes __quant1__ report ... sometimes you gotta stay on top of it for a while .
there are special rules for what you want to do , offering non @-@ brand replacement components ( in your case , the wood case ) .
unfortunately , i just do n't recall what they all are ...
there 's a way to word the description that works and does n't get you slapped for " keyword spamming " ( which is what putting __name1__ in the descriptive text will earn you ) .
fun stuff , eh ?
that sounds right ...
as long as it does n't fall into the not allowed category by meeting this criteria :
using " compatible with , " " fits , " or " for " before a brand name in the title of your listing to describe items that are universally compatible or that are compatible with an entire product class
just know if it is someone that is " after you " ( which sometimes happens ) - there is always some violation that you are breaking or you are near the questionable portion of breaking some policy .
because __name1__ will usually " pull __value1__ ask later " when a listing is reported , your listings will only become better and you may just sell more because of what you learn on how to become a better seller as you refine your listings .
if you keep a good sense of humor and communicate with __name1__ ... __name1__ will start " ask __value1__ pull later ".
hello ,
i wonder if someone can clear something up for me ?
__quant1__ have a £63,950 svr mortgage with __name1__ with 19 __quant1__ @/@ 2 years left . ( it 's currently £64,570 due to some stupidity a few yrs ago ) .
now , this was originally taken out as interest only but when i 've phoned a couple of years ago to increase the payment they have changed it to " part interest , part repayment ". not too fussed about this as __quant2__ 've worked out the numbers and the correct amount is coming off the capital every month .
i 'm going to contact __name1__ for details on how to make overpayments as i 've increased my direct debit again but would like to be able to make ad @-@ hoc overpayments when i 'm able to .
thing i 'm curious about is the __value1__ % overpayment thing - i know my mortgage agreement is subject to this however what does it really mean ? should i only be paying __value2__ % more than my interest only payments or is it __value3__ % extra off the capital ? my new direct debit ( as of end __month1__ would take me over the __value4__ % of io payments ) .
i 'm guessing they will give me a rough idea of how much i can overpay in £s based on my current direct debit but would be interested to know beforehand just for my knowledge .
currently __name1__ have on their records that " pensions " will be paying the capital off at the end of the term - these are currently non existent so trying to get myself at least on track for repayment at the end of term .
thanks very much !
its __value1__ % of the mortgage balance for the year , so if your mortgage balance in £100,000 that year you can overpay by £10,000 during the course of the year without penalty .
however , if you are on the svr you dont have the __value1__ % limit , just overpay as much as you can comfortably afford
quote :
are you sure you 're on svr ? or just a rate that is soon to end ?
having worked for __name1__ it is indeed correct that once you 've reached the svr then no overpayment limits are enforced you are simply free to overpay as much as you wish to .
this is correct . your kfi @/@ mortgage offer may say something along the lines of ' in any __quant1__ year you may repay up to __value1__ % of the amount outstanding on your special rate product '. it 's a rolling __quant2__ months , so the year starts when you make your __value2__ st overpayment . so , you could n't pay £10k in __month1__ and another £10k in __month2__ for instance , you 'd need to wait __quant3__ months .
then , once your ' special rate product ' ends , you go onto svr , with no overpayment restrictions .
hi , i 'm in the middle of a divorce and am trying to take on the mortgage on the family home .
i 'm only trying to borrow about __value1__ % of my home 's current market value , which is about twice my __quant1__ income .
have approached several big lenders and tried going through a financial adviser , but noone will lend because my income is made up of : __quant1__ very part @-@ time jobs ( __quant3__ employed , __quant2__ self @-@ employed ) , maintenance ( not yet court ordered ) and tax credits .
their argument is that once my daughter leaves school some of these income sources will cease , but by then i would hope to be back at work full time ( she 's only 7!) .
the mortgage rates i 've been quoted are less than i 'm paying at the moment anyway !
it 's been suggested to me that i try and take out a personal loan instead ?
anyone got any suggestions ?
you would think that having __quant2__ part time jobs that at least you will have 2 at any one time and that is more secure than having __quant1__ full time job and possibly being given notice to leave .
it sounds like you are self employed and will need the assistance of an accountant to create some books that show some decent profit combining all the sources of income streams as __quant1__ source of income .
they may be doing an affordability calculation instead of a income multiple and do n't think you can afford to pay for day to day living expenses and a mortgage .
i would get another financial advisor who can help you .
someone should be able to lend you the money .
hi all , i currently have a mortgage which what used to be __name1__ .
i took the mortgage out in __year1__ , fixed rate for __quant1__ years .
this is due to finish in __month1__ .
i do n't know what to do !
i took the mortgage out with my then husband , we split __quant1__ years ago .
he did all the money side of things so have no idea where to go .
i have a funny feeling that since house prices have dropped , i am likely to be in negative equity .
we borrowed more than __value1__ % , retrospectively a stupid thing to do .
i have taken the mortgage on on my own .
any advice would be gratefully received , thank you .
in rate terms , there 's nothing you can do .
if you are in negative equity as you seem to think , there is no prospect of another lender taking you on , so a remortgage is n't going to be possible .
__name1__ @/@ __name1__ which is the body managing your mortgage does not offer replacement or customer retention products , so your mortgage will revert to the follow @-@ on rate set out in your original key facts illustration ( kfi ) or mortgage offer .
this is likely to be the standard variable rate , currently __value1__ % .
given theat the current lending and borrowing siatuion , it is more difficult for people to get a mortgage .
i understand that martgage broker is to be able to see from a lot of providers .
but for people are dififcult to get mortgage today , is their advise is worthy ...
say for instance they say it is better you ask for this provider but in fact , when you afollow their suggestion , you get rejected ?
is not that it is better to sticj to your bak who knows wel your financial stability and ability ??
i undesratnd that some mortgage adviser are free of charge .
i am asking here because once you get rejected it will seriously danage your credibility to get another lender ?
opinions and expereince from people in ths forum are really appreciated ....
first of all i disagree that its harder to get a mortgage ... compared to the days of __value1__ %+ mortgages yes but for the right applicants there is plenty of lending available .
obviously i am biased as i am an independant mortgage adviser but my view is it is good that we can source the whole market finding the best deals and knowing the specific lending criteria of each lender .
i used to work for a bank and i would never offer my services to my friends and family as i did n't know whether there were better services elsewhere .
now i am comfortable doing things for my friends and family .
banks will want you to think that you have a better chance of getting a mortgage with them as you have your finances with them but this is simply not true .
if you get rejected you need to look into the reasons why...affordability..credit score etc
hi my husband and i are looking to buy the hosue we currently live in , but we do not have a deposit .
are there any __value1__ % mortgages out there and which ones are the best to look at -
i am totally useless when it comes to things like this and hubby is no better ! !!
__quant2__ currently earn about £21k __quant1__ year and hubby earns just under £15k __quant2__ year .
what is the likelyhood of us getting a mortgage to start off with and is going to be more difficult to find __value1__ % one ?
any advice would be appreciated . thanks
whats the value of your house ? ,
hows both your credit rating ?
this seems to be the __value1__ most important factors when considering a mortgage other than your joint income .
the chance of getting a __value1__ % is probably impossible to be honest ...
a shared ownership property is one where you do not buy the property outright , but only a percentage share of the property . for example only __value1__ % .
however on the remaining __value1__ % which is still owned by the housing association , you will pay __quant1__ rent .
so if you are not looking at this types of properties , you will not get a __value1__ % mortgage .
hello all - just joined and after some advice .
__quant1__ 've seen the posts on the forum relating to the __name1__ consent to let and subsequent hike in interest rates by __value1__ % ( this is going back __quant1__ year or __quant2__ ) .
at the time my wife and i were renting out our property and had signed up to a __quant1__ year fixed rate mortgage .
we initially lived in the property but subsequently let it out having received permission to do so from __name1__ .
given we were in a fixed rate mortgage and had paid for the extra security i was pretty shocked and appalled that they were forcing this increase on us .
in any case my wife went to __name1__ to discuss our options with the mortgage adviser .
the long and short of it is that the mortgage adviser gave the advice that given base rate was __value1__ % and we could move to another lender on a formal btl mortgage for a far lower rate ( given with the __value3__ % increase our __name1__ rate would be over __value2__ %) and therefore over a the mortgage term more than cover the early repayment fee .
this advice made perfect sense so we paid to come out of our fixed rate with __name1__ and moved to another lender - the early repayment fee was circa £3k .
subsequently we received the letter from __name1__ ( as i am sure many did ) saying that those on fixed rate mortgages that would have to pay early redemption fees would not have the __value1__ % increase imposed until the end of the term of the fixed rate .
given the advice we received and subsequent redemption fee we paid ( prior to nationwide changing their minds ) i wonder whether anyone thinks we have any recourse against __name1__ .
be very interested in any thoughts .
many thanks
it definitely sounds interesting .
i would certainly go to the branch , speak to someone in management and present this letter along with any documentary evidence that you may have had from your previous meeting .
also get them to produce the notes of your previous meeting with the mortgage adviser .
we came within a gnats whisker of paying a 7k early redemption fee to avoid the __value1__ % hike .
thankfully the letter arrived __quant1__ day before our completion date on our new mortgage so we were able to get out of it .
only __quant1__ months until we can leave __name1__ and move over to a proper btl mortgage .
are there any bridging companies who 'll do a loan for an uninhabitable property ( it 's derelict )?
we need to borrow __value1__ % of the hammer price until we can get planning permission for restoration which will allow us to get a mortgage
( verbal approval of our plans has been given by the local planning officer and the building society in question ) .
( excuse me while i do a little - this is a building we nearly bought through normal channels __quant1__ years ago , got gazumped on and never thought we 'd ever get another crack at it ! )
it does n't seem likely and would be horrendously expensive .
look at it from the lender 's point of view :
this is high risk - if you do n't get planning approval the site could actually be worth a negative amount ( due to demolition costs ) .
verbal approval is essentially worth nothing .
on the flip side there is little return for the lender as you do n't want the loan for long so not much time to charge interest .
really you would be better off : getting a mortgage not a bridging loan ( also difficult ) . getting an unsecured loan to buy it initially .
be aware that almost no bank or building society will give a mortgage on a property after it has been bought , if it was bought less than __quant1__ months ago .
i do n't know the answer to your question , but it sounds very risky to me .
you will be taking on a costly short @-@ term loan based only on verbal promises which may not eventually come good .
what happens if the b soc does n't eventually make an offer , or it 's at a much lesser amount than you hope for ?
does it know that the house is uninhabitable - usually that makes a property unmortgeable .
or if the pp takes much longer to be considered because there are objections / it 's refused and you have to appeal etc ?
last time we got a thread like this , i suggested tiuta and the op did some research and found the cost was prohibitive .
i echo the other comment about how you deal with being unable to remortgage if something goes wrong and would ask you to note you 'll have to stick with the bridging finance for around __quant1__ months as you won't be able to apply for the remortgage until you 've owned the property for __quant2__ .
caution needed .
bridging is only possible where the lender believes you will live elsewhere .
they cannot lend on a property you will be living in as this then falls into __name1__ regulation , which bridging is excluded from .
an alternate to bridging is a non status mortgage , but the lender will still need to survey the property and carry out the nusual due dilligence to include full legal conveyancing and checks .
the reason most aution deals are cash is that lending is never guaranteed and can fall through at the mast moment , meaning the applicant looses the property and thier __value1__ % deposit .
you 'll need a good deal of luck to get this through using lending .
also bridgers usualy want a clearly defined exit route , and it wont be sufficient to say a remortgage should be possible subject to all manner of property repairs ( what if you fall ill / go mad / get depressed part way into the renovation for example ) .
hi all , current mortgage fixed deal ends in __month1__ and this will be the __value1__ time remortgaging .
purchased the property __month1__ __year1__ .
the property was valued at £102000 when we purchased it and we now owe £77000 .
i am interested in learning more about how valuations work when remortgaging .
do they come round ?
are there any ways i can improve the potential result ?
what happens ?
nothing much has changed since last valuation in or out the property .
to be honest i would be happy with £102000 valuation but guess we will find out .
any information anyone can provide about this process would be great .
are you remortgaging to a new lender , or doing a product transfer with the current one ?
if it 's the latter , chances are your current lender will use a desktop system called hometrack .
if you are moving your mortgage to a new lender , it will normally ask a surveyor to visit the property to establish its value .
as you are right on the __value1__ % borderline for the better products , i would imagine an inspection would be better for you .
talk to your current lender before you start shopping around .
it 's been solved now .
thanks for everyone
why on earth would you allow somebody else to sort out payslips and __name1__ for you ?
if you had proof of income why not provide it ?
you have been complicit in any fraudulent application by allowing it to happen with full knowledge .
struggling to see how you could compain to the lender and __name1__ when you applied fraudulently .
i suspect you are now registered as a fraudulent applicant and will struggle to gain finance anywhere .
hi , i 've a dilema !
looking to remortgage , and have found suitable product from __name1__ . £195 non @-@ refundable application fee , conveyancing and valuation free .
it is a __value1__ % ltv .
my house is worth very close to the __value1__ % mark .
if i apply , and the valuation comes out lower , i 'd have to pick the next best product , which is actually __name1__ .
__name1__ valued for free at £180000 , which is the amount we estimated it to be .
mortgage balance is £134000 , so as you can see , very close to the __quant1__ % .
i could just go with __name1__ ,
no fees , but would cost me additional £1700 over the __quant1__ year fixed term .
do i risk losing the £195?
i suppose only i can answer that , but any thoughts or tips ?
you appear to have done the maths and identified the pitfalls .
if there 's no way of avoiding that fee , you appear to have to risk it .
is n't there a product with no fees you could choose upto __value1__ % so you 'd lose nothing if the property is downvalued ?
lenders i have spoken to say that while their valuation fee is ' free ', you still have to pay for it but it is refunded if you go ahead .
i guess it 's not always the case ( only spoke to __quant1__ lenders , and perhaps __quant2__ only discussed it with __quant2__ of them ) .
it 's one of the reasons why i 'm not remortgaging at the moment - found a great __value1__ % rate but could go the wrong way of the house is valued lower than expected .
just to also say , __name1__ are quite strict on affordability too not just ltv ,
their online affordability calculator is quite close .
__name1__ are not as strict .
good evening people ,
was looking for a little advise in regards to the possible mis @-@ selling by a mortgage broker of a 100 % intrest only mortgage .
my partner signed up for a __value1__ % intrest only mortgage with the nothern __name1__ mortgage but to realise it was a intrest only mortgage some __quant1__ years down the line .
the reason i feel that may have a case to be answered is that surely mortgage company must take some precautions when selling an intrest only mortgage
i.e the customer must take out some sort of endowment to ensure that when the mortgage intrest is finally paid off then the customer would be in a financial position to pay of the actual amount the mortgage was agreed for ? ??
the mortgage broker who advised obviously has a case to answer but are nothern __name1__ in the wrong aswell ?
any information that can be offered would be greatly appreciated .
no , there is not .
read the paperwork she got when she took out the mortgage - it will explain that you need to set up a repayment vehicle for the capital amount .
i would also be amazed if the broker did not also advise her of this .
unfortunately this was quite a common problem , particularly with young __value1__ time buyers who have no real clue about mortgages .
this was a problem during the boom years in that banks were not checking if customers had a repayment vehicle in place , hence they were throwing these interest only mortgages at people because that 's all they could afford because house prices were so high .
there are people on here who will deny this ever took place .
many people put a lot of faith in some of these brokers in the belief that they were acting in their best interests .
unfortunately there is probably little come back because ultimately your partner should have read closely what she was getting into before she signed .
i know that might sound callous but there is the saying that covers this which is ' buyer beware '.
where do we go from here ?
some stocks have had a great run since early __month1__
is it time to cash in and wait for the next drop or have we bottomed and its a steady rise from here ?
i would like to here from anyone who saw the last recession , late eighties , pan out and how the sectors reacted .
i viewed charts from then ,
it shows volatility till ' 92 before a general steady rise although different sectors behaved differently
any thoughts appreciated
quote : agree with purchy .
__quant1__ think we 'll be rangebound for quite a few years .
except there is a good chance that commodities and commodity stocks will spike violently upwards for a while in __quant1__ year or so ( higher than __time-of1__ were in __year1__ ) , thanks to supply destruction which may well have a coiled spring effect .
also inflation and a falling dollar should help them go up as well..
there is also good reason to believe that commodities will rise over the long terma s well .
hi , __value1__ st time posting so please bear with me !
i am due to receive approx 20k from sale of deceased parental home and need to find somewhere to put it .
have used up my __name1__ allowance ( so has hubby ) may need to access all our funds within the next __quant1__ month as we will either be moving home or doing self build if nothing suitable comes on market .
therefore need to be able to access funds without too much penalty/notice .
have __quant1__ kids and wonder if i could put money in children accounts for better tax free interest or do you have any suggestions please ?
thanks in advance for any help
based on what you have said , you should not invest but stick to savings .
check out the usual tables on this site for interest rates .
if you put money into the name of your child it becomes his beneficially .
in any case see __value1__ for tax treatment of interest on money given to children by parents .
you could always hold the cash in an on @-@ line account ( aa paying __value1__ % gross ) until __month1__
then each of you can put £5640 into a cash __name1__ ?
hi an elderly relative ( late __quant1__ s lives in annex adjoining the house ) has banked with __name1__ all her life - and she asked me for some general advice .
i wasnt at all familiar with her financial situation and she has in the past been advised by __name1__ .
what appears to be the case is that she has : £150k+ in an oeic @/@ shares __name1__ with __name2__ £30k in easy access savings account paying __value1__ % with __name3__ £15k in current account with __name3__ £5k in cash isa with __name3__
what struck me was that she has all her savings in __name1__ @/@ __name2__ so well over the £85k protection limit .
also that she had been advised to put so much in oeic @/@ corporate bonds/shares isas as it appears her capital has been fluctuating ( generally down ) .
she invested this whilst in her __quant1__ s so am struggling to see how it would be good advice to ask her to put so much in a scheme where capital is not protected .
anyhow we have booked an appointment next week to go through this with me in support .
do others think this advice is strange ?
and what would others advise .
my instinct is to get her into good savings accounts where capital is not at risk and to split it across __quant1__ different institutions ( it seems you can can get __value1__ %+ if you keep an eye on the rates being offered ) , plus make sure she uses all the __name1__ allowance each year
any thoughts @/@ commented would be appreciated ? david
i 'd be reluctant to start messing with an elderly relative 's finances .
others in the family might accuse you of all sorts when she dies .
that said : 1 ) if she 's of sound mind you need to understand if she 's prepared to move from __name1__ or not .
another bank may confuse her significantly .
2 ) if she wants to stay with __name1__ , support her in finding the best home for her money from their range , but also help her to keep it in a good paying account , as most of their accounts have __quant1__ month bonuses .
3 ) make sure you do n't do anything with cash __name1__ that could impact her stocks and shares isa .
4 ) get her agreement to shift money from the current account to a better savings account ( even if it 's only the __value1__ % one ) .
just because somebody 's old does n't mean that capital should be protected .
my biggest concern for her would be if she owns a property .
there 's a high chance of an iht bill on the horizon .
i 'd be talking to an ifa about the best ways to mitigate this .
as dunstonh suggests , the shares will effectively be in her name and are n't relevant to the protection scheme .
this is a very tough one .
banks generally will do what 's best for them which is invariably bad for the customers .
there is a lot of evidence these are some of the worst routes to market due to them often having the highest costs .
as mentioned though , change is never fun , especially when it could be confusing and misunderstood .
i would personally say she should find an ifa and pay upfront for advice ( ie no commissions ) so she gets what is most suitable for her .
given her age it 's standard practice to have less money in equity and more in guaranteed income than she currently appears to have due to short term fluctuations .
i 'm probably going to get criticized for what i 'm about to write , but as a long time lurker on these forums i know that i can also expect some sensible and honest opinions .
i have been having a relationship with a married man for some time now and i 'm starting to get fed up with the situation and wonder if this is all it 's ever going to be .
how likely is it that a married man would leave his wife for the ' other woman ', how do i know if he 's serious about me or just toying with me ?
i know he does love me , but that 's not always enough is it ?
i am really torn at the moment whether to let things carry on , or to walk away .
likelihood of him leaving his wife for you , slim to none .
even if he does could you live your life happily ?
if he can do it to his wife , would he have qualms about doing it to his girlfriend ?
1 . the person you are having the affair with is cheating on his wife .
if he does it once , he could do it again - remember the old saying " when a man marries his mistress , it leaves a vacancy - for the next mistress ".
2 . quite simply , he is cheating , you are cheating .
there are all the excuses in the world " he will leave when the children are older @/@ when his wife is better @/@ when they 've sorted out finances - just waiting for the right time to tell her " blah , blah blah , blah !
if you have any integrety , you would walk away now .
are you in a relationship with anybody ? or are you single
he 's having his cake and eating it at the moment ?
why would he want to give that up ?
i 'm struggling for ideas as to what to do for my birthday this week .
dh will be at work , ds at school and dd at nursery till __time1__ pm unless i choose to take her out for the day so i can go somwhere till 3.15pm .
in some ways i envy my dh who has a __month1__ birthday that generally falls within schools holidays and we are all around him with good weather .
on mine its generally dull , raining or cold and everyone is working .
this year i 've thougth and thought about what i can do either on my own or maybe with my almost __quant1__ year old .
my mum suggested i go over with her to visit my dad who 's on a house sit and have a sandwich with them at lunchtime and open my pressie .
this seems to be my best option but its not what i would choose to do or really want to do .
my parents have chosen to do this house sit , i really dont mind but i 'm not sure __quant1__ want to go over , walk the dog and sit in a strangers house for a couple of hours to pass the time .
any thoughts please on what you grown ups do for __month1__ birthdays when the weather is rubbish and your friends are working .
i dont expect to be entertained and happy to potter around or go to a national trust/swimming , but my local pool doens't have an open swim on thurs suitable for my availability and i do n't have a car free to drive .
hmmmm ....... its quandry !
chalk it up to one those things that happens when you have kids and do something at the weekend instead .
mine was on the __day1__ th .
( eta : had __quant1__ had the money , __quant1__ would have gone off for a couple of hours and a coffee at the nicest garden centre near to where __quant1__ live so __quant1__ could get there by bus )
go for a meal with your dh in the evening after his work , and get your parents to babysit ?
day time wise - how much money do you want to spend ?
get your nails @/@ hair etc done ?
depends what youre in to .
i dont normally do anything in the day time for my bday ,
id do something at the nearest weekend or that night .
i 'm trying to muster some sympathy for you but i 'm sorry i really can n't .
my birthday is in __month1__ too , and most year __month1__ have to work . for the whole day ! !!!
this year , i worked all day , could n't celebrate with my dd because she was working in the evening , so i went out for a bite to eat with a couple of friends and then on to see a film .
i 'll celebrate my birthday with my dd when we both have some time together ... in __month1__ .
your parents want to see you and spend some time with you , give you a present so be gracious ( and a bit mature ) and go !
hi , i am getting married on __month1__ __day1__ th __year1__ and i am planning on buying a gift for my wife to be .
she loves __name1__ and i bought her the chunky link bracelet with heart in the __value1__ few months that we were together so now i am thinking to get her the necklace .
is the official __name1__ uk website the only place to buy official and not fake items or are there other places that sell tiffany ?
plus anyone else have any other similar ideas ? ?
looked at __name1__ and pandora but i 'm not sure ....
sounds lovely .
the only place to buy genuine tiffany is the website or __name1__ shops .
the only place to get __name1__ cheaper is the airport shops abroad , if the exchange rate/ duty free combination works in your favour .
having the matching necklace is a lovely idea .
if she likes charms you could get the __name1__ sweetie bracelet - then you have the next few presents sorted out for the charms .
oh came home from work on monday evening by taxi and found __quant1__ men trying to break into the house .
they set upon him , knocked him to the floor and kicked him several times in head and stomach , stole his mobile phone and bag and ran off .
the police came out very quickly , did a drive around with oh and the cabby but did n't see them that night .
they took dh 's bag ( which they found dumped a few streets away ) and said they would forensically test it , and there was a cctv camera which covered the area and the cabby said he could definitely identify the men as he got a clear view .
dh has not been asked to give a statement , and we assume nor has the cabby .
he got a letter in the post this morning , dated tuesday , saying the police were closing their investigation .
the detective in charge has n't answered phone calls and his bag has n't been returned to him , which contained business papers and clothes .
dh did need treatment at a and e after the attack
it seems pretty clear that the police did not bother with forensic testing and may not even have checked the cctv footage .
is there anything which can be done to challenge their decision not even to do a preliminary investigation into an attempted burglary and common assault , where there are witnesses to the attack ?
if it is relevant at all , dh has no previous convictions , arrests or anything similar with the police , and is a middle aged businessman set upon by __quant1__ year old males of a different racial background to us .
no , something is wrong here .
they can n't just ' close an investigation ' the day afterwards , not having even taken statements .
i 'd say get some legal advice , or write to the police , stating what you 've put in your post above and ask for an explanation .
you could try posting this on the moneysaving in marriage and relationships board ?
you might get more answers there .
i would get down to the police station sooner than just writing a letter .
if cctv needs to be examined and has not yet been looked at , you want it seized asap , before it is recorded over .
it is of course possible that the __name1__ was n't working on the day in question but i am still surprised no other forensic examinations have taken place .
if a full note of your oh 's / the cabby 's evidence was taken in a police notebook then the need for an immediate witness statement is reduced .
if this is really true , start here : __value1__
but ! be prepared to be stopped for motoring offences by disgruntled coppers for the next __quant1__ or so years ........
make a formal complaint .
the police are trying to fiddle the figures .
was it even recorded as a crime ?
ask for the crime number and see .
i 'm actually v excited as it all seems like fun , but all ex leaders are v cynical ?
i think as with everything from reading this thread there 's always the politics and the ooo could you just do a bit more for us aspect , we 'll have to keep our mouths firmly zipped .
i 'm looking to trying to start volunteering sometime in the near future and was a rainbow/brownie/guide when younger and think i might enjoy helping out but have no idea how to make the __value1__ steps to get involved
hi all i am looking for advice please .
dd1 is in futher education -
because the course she wanted to do is n't available near us she is in residential college and we pay her accommodation and food costs ,
it leaves things very tight , but as we felt this was a great opportunity for her we were prepared to do it .
she also has the use of a car as its easier ( and a lot cheaper ) than us driving her back and forth most weeks .
dd2 is due to leave school next summer and is hoping to start a hairdressing apprenticeship .
she started to talk about driving lessons ( a bit premature i know ) and us buying a car and paying for petrol and insurance .
i mentioned to her that as she will be earning an income it will be time for her to start paying us towards her keep , etc.
she thinks that will be very unfair as we are still paying for her older sister .
any suggestions please - we are prepared to take the money and put it away for her future ( although i would n't admit that to her as she would want it sooner rather than later ) .
i do see her point , but am not prepared to let her get away with not paying anything .
thanks for reading .
does her sister earn any money ?
if she does n't , then you could speak to them both about the contributions you expect from them when they both start earning .
as for the car - did you pay for dd1s lessons ?
it seems unfair to not pay for dd2s if you did , and then to allow access to the car .
i do n't see why she would expect her own car if her sister shares yours , although you will have to think about priorities for who needs the car and what you will do if both want the car !
letting her get away without paying anything won't teach her anything for the future , but equally if she does't get the same treatment as her sister she 'll probably feel quite upset .
my grandaughter is in the final year of __quant1__ of a hairdressing course ,
she has to work part @-@ time in a salon but does n't earn very much and the stuff she has had to buy @/@ keep replacing for the course has been very expensive.. so my daughter has had to help her by not actually taking any keep money as long as she is on the course..
its meant my grandaughter has managed to pay for all her own clothes , fares , lunches , and going out money over the course..
my daughter was happy that she 'd found something she wanted to do and was able to near enough support herself through it..
as i said at the beginning as an apprentice she will be earning peanuts..
i agree with what is being said tw .
to support dd1 to the tune that you are and then to expect dd2 to pay into the household on what i 'm sure will be a much less than minimum wage apprenticeship seems like a double blow to dd2 to me ! and i can appreciate her frustration .
i do think that whilst dd2 is doing her apprenticeship she should be allowed to retain her wages .
you should explain to her that this is your way of ensuring that they are both treated equally in what are very different circumstances .
however i would also make clear that once either of them begin to earn a full time wage outside of college or apprenticeship that they will be expected to contribute to the house if they continue to live there !
i wish you well .
i 'm sorry but i can see your dd2 's point -
you say you would support her if she went to college but even though you agree that the apprenticeship would be a better career choice you 're prepared to penalise her for it .
if she was leaving school to get a normal job i would agree she should contribute but this is basically her still studying , just going about it in a slightly less conventional way .
has she arranged to apply for this herself ?
that to me shows a lot of intitative and motivation for someone her age ,
rather then taking the more mainstream option of college she has looked into her options and gone for what will be best for her future career .
apprentice wages are extremely low so while she is on those could you maybe look at a compromise -
eg you will still provide her room and board ( the same as you are doing for her sister ) but she has to pay all her expenses out of her wage , ie her travel to work , lunches there if she needs them , phone if she has it , any expenses she needs for work .
hmmmmmm hard one here !
normally i would say yes , take a nominal amount from your dd2 as she is now " working ", but as you are supporting dd1 , i can see why she might be cheesed off .
i guess it depends on how much she is earning during her __value1__ year as an apprentice ......
lets say , for talks sake , it 's £100 __quant1__ week ,
that 's still a lot of money for a school leaver who has no household expenses or food to pay .
personally __quant1__ would take a small amount , say £20 __quant1__ week from her and , as you said , put it in a savings account for if she does decide to go travelling in the future .
explain to here that it may not seem fair , but she is now earning , and the cost of this compared to living away from home , is minimal . or show her a breakdown of what a 1 @/@ 3 of all household cost would be .
in regards to the car , does your dd1 really need one ?
of course it is easier for her to get home at weekends , but can she not get the train / bus ?
when i was at uni , i think i could count the number of students who lived away from home and had a car on one hand - the rest mnade do with a young persons railcard .
and will your dd2 need a car ?
if the answer if no , neither of them really need it then i would suggest that they share the car ( __quant2__ month on / off , for example ) .
a car for a teenager / student , is an expensive luxury and with the rising costs of insurance and fuel , most parents cannot this for __quant1__ child , let alone __quant2__ .
it begins and ends with __name1__ .
if __name2__ never pushed __name3__ , then __name1__ would be running away with the nomination !
funny he was considered the most conservative option in __year1__ !
__name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ etc all said __name5__ was the conservative candidate .
fast forward to __year1__ and now he is the liberal candidate .
nothing change , except the passing of __name1__ !
i think you draw the wrong interpretation of __year1__ .
he was n't the most conservative , __name1__ was .
and __name1__ was sincere .
what you forget about all those talking heads is that they are all paid by big corporations .
the real problem is that corporate conservatism and social conservatism are n't on the same page .
the big corporations do n't give a shit about abortion or gay marriage or gettin ' jay @-@ a @-@ zus into your life .
they just want laws friendly to __name1__ , and __name2__ is that guy .
__name1__ actually believed in all that jay @-@ a @-@ zus shit , and that scared the corporate guys .
here 's the ugly little truth .
the religious right could win elections without the corporate right .
easily .
they 'd even have an easier time of it , because a lot of religious people vote __name1__ and are n't fooled into voting against their own economic interests .
one of the most lucid , reasonable descriptions of __name1__ i 've seen yet , well done .
the guy is awkward and does n't connect .
there are obviously plenty of people like that , it does n't make you evil , but it 's obviously a significant handicap when you 're running for president .
add that to the fact that he just seems so eager to please , and you have a guy who is n't easy to trust .
what ?
liberals are finding something wrong with __name1__ ?
unbelievable !
if you want to pretend that __name1__ is perfect , okay , your call , i see it with partisans on both sides all the time .
it is possible , however , to admit weaknesses in candidates from your party without being arrested .
it is possible to be reasonable and honest , too .
read the post i made right after that one .
apology accepted .
as i 'm pretty sure that the op was asking __name1__ voters , i will answer .
keep in mind that even though i 'm a registered __name1__ i am decidedly libertarian .
__name1__ has a credibility issue with me .
even after i put aside all the things that i disagree with him on ( me , being a libertarian ) i just cannot trust him to do the things i would expect of a __name1__ .
i am not convinced that he will repeal __name1__ , i am not convinced that he will reduce government spending , and i am not convinced that he will run the country like a businessman .
having followed the last __quant1__ presidential races , ( 9 in total ) i am familiar with __name1__ , and familiar with what he says compared to wht he has done and what he has said .
that 's what is wrong with __name1__ , and what is right about romney is that with all his faults , he 's 10 times better than __name2__ .
why would you think the o/p is asking " __name1__ ".
i 've voted __name1__ enough times where i 'm probably the better gauge .
just sayin
thank you though for pointing out what the real problem is ...
it 's the rightwingnut base and the difficulties of appealing to it if one is a normal moderate person .
btw , you are n't a libertarian if you 're anti @-@ choice .
just sayin
jumping with both feet right into a pile of bull shit are n't you .
i am and have always been pro @-@ choice all the way accross the board .
in every area , i am pro choice , pro freedom .
which makes me an enemy of __name1__ .
then you have my apology and it makes unique among so @-@ called " libertarians " on this board .
carry on .
looks like you made the post after i did , did n't you .
no apology needed .
and the __name1__ twins too .
it 's only a __quant1__ way street with tm and crew you know .
now once the children become celebs on their own they are free game .
the __name1__ twins have not pursued this angle however __quant1__ __name2__ child has .
and she dances like a horse .
really ? ?
so are you going to claim that trig ...
willow etc became a celeb on theri own then ?
because the nastynesshas not been not just aimed at __name1__ .
also care to explain the nastyness that came from your side prior to __name1__ ?
you do know it was heaped on them before that ...
right ?
sorry ...
you lose .
__name1__ aso got nearly 1 @/@ 4 million from a non profit to promote non teen pregnancy .
she got out on __name1__ circuit before __name1__ starz .
making 1 @/@ 4 mill off of her getting pregnant ?
or capitolizing on her mothers fame ?
do you guys even remember how you have treated __name1__ and __name2__ ?
boxer and di fi ?
amy carter when she was but a child ?
chelsea ?
you never seen to mind women being treated like crap unless its some right wing woman .
no , i do n't please elaborate .
on his tv show , early in the __name3__ administration , __name1__ put up a picture of socks , the __name2__ cat , and asked , ' did you know there 's a white house dog ?
' then he put up a picture of __name1__ , who was __quant1__ years old at the time and as far as i know had never done any harm to anyone .
when viewers objected , he claimed , in typical __name1__ fashion , that the gag was an accident and that without his permission some technician had put up the picture of __name2__ -- which i found as disgusting as his original attempt at humor .
__name1__ href="http://mediamatters.org/research/200809020015"> hannity 's memory lapse : " i do __name2__ chelsea clinton being attacked __name3__ for america </a>
so ...
were you idignant ? ?
outraged ? ?
if so ...
you have no business excusing it from your own side .
sorry ...
" so and so did it too " does n't cut it outside of kindergarden .
so ? ?
this automatically gives you and others the right to call her nasty names and attack her looks , body , sexuality etc ? ?
funny , i seem to remember a recent thread about how ugly black women are .
hmmm , maybe it was only racist ?
oh ...
you mean the posts where people here were claiming __name1__ looked like a man ?
yes ...
i saw those too .
sure she made herself a public figure by her choice and action .
same as you have rights to criticize __name1__ or hanoi jane , etc.
what did trig palin do to deserve the treatment he 's gotten ?
oh , yeah -- he 's a __name1__ .
did i say anything about trig ?
poor thing has __name1__ for a mom he needs all the breaks he can get .
spin and dance till you are dizzy though .
i never once said that there was no sexism .
there is sexism , racism , homophobia , etc...
all in politics .
what i said was is that the candidates were not treated any differently by the media ( and that includes pundits ) based on whether they were conservative or liberal .
i do n't care what you " say " is supposedly true .
i have read articles written by women who experienced the bias first hand , and later talked about it openly via the media curcuit ( see __name1__ and __name2__ ) .
i will take their word for it thanks .
there is no bias .
women are subject to sexism in politics ...
it is not unique to one party or the other .
minorities are subject to bigotry in politics ...
no party bias needed .
what do n't you get ?
that you are telling me __name1__ was treated the same as __name2__ ?
rofl !
do n't come in here spouting there is no sexist bias in the liberal media , then refuse to back up your claims and expect to be taken seriously .
it do n't wash .
neither does deflection .
i will give you __quant1__ example of different treatment .
watch the __name1__ show when he has a liberal guest .
it is all fun , smiles , agreement and a few softball questions .
then watch him interview a conservative guest and get back to me .
that is the case on almost every show all day long on __name1__ . i call it the aoatt network since it is all __name2__ all the time .
and pundits on __name1__ are different how exactly ?
have you watched a __name1__ " interview " ( gush , gush ) ...
excuse me again !
but while everyone is donning sackclothe and ashes over some supposed slurs thrown toward __name1__ and __name2__ ( for which i have yet to see a scintilla of evidence .)
does anyone remember how __name1__ broaderick was treated ?
lewinsky ?
paula jones ?
it was like i was back in high school .
the same sexist double standard that feminists supposedly were fighting against was enshrined in public policy and they took it down it even attacking __quant1__ year olds !
__name1__ was some " victim " of his hormones .
" i mean he could n't help himself .
after all he 's a guy ! "
poor wittle __name1__ .
and the women were " nuts and sluts ! "
the guy is a hero and a victim , the girl is a gutter slut !
and the same feminists who were going after sexual harrassment after the __name1__ debacle failed to take down __name2__ , took their rage on the road and started attacking __quant1__ years olds with " sexual harrassment ."
but the same people who went after __quant1__ year olds for " kissing a girls buttons , " suddenly turned a blind eye when it came to __name1__ !
bubba was a victim and feminists went so far as to write they would get on their hands and knees and give bubba a __name1__ as long as he kept abortion legal .
anyone remember that ?
i sure as hell do !
and anyone want to remember how the __name1__ twins were treated .
__name1__ was even doing " that 's my __name2__ " with the __name2__ twins as incestuous lesbians .
and you libs claim oppression over __name1__ and __name2__ ?
har de har har !
what selective memories you all have !
notice how liberals won't address the different treatment the women against __name1__ got ?
provide examples of how they have n't been .
i have a personal bug about any guy who thinks it 's relevant to comment about a woman 's " fuck @-@ ability "...

we 're talkin ' " conservative " -@ women , here .
that shouldn ' t include marriage ?????
you state the candidates were not treated differently ...
then when showed you are wrong ...
can n't even back up your bs with anything other than your useless bluster .
this ain't hard .
why ?
you wont .
who 's an idiot ?
oh yeah , women that make themselves completely dependent on men .
and the americans who support sharia law , considering in __name1__ sharia law puts women as subservient to men .
i have no problem with folks that want to voluntarily put themselves in such a position , anymore than i do with folks that want to live by __name1__ law or any other religious dictates that do n't interfere with secular law .
as with all religions , in __name1__ , you can quit and the state will not punish you nor allow anyone else to bring you to harm over it , though the community may shun you .
that 's why we have __name1__ , __name2__ and sf . the only punishment a religious community can exert is expulsion .
oh well .
the problem is the women in those countries dont have a choice .
the __name1__ who support __name2__ law are anti @-@ woman , anti @-@ gay , racist bigots .
it sucks that the __name1__ moderates in this country and other countries do n't speak out against those in their religion who still think backwards like this .
i find it hypocritical when many of the liberal minded people on this board support __name1__ law and that sect of the __name2__ faith , it bothers me to be honest .
this is the " definition " of a liar to a liberal .
anyone that tells them the truth and they know they can n't refute it .
notice he can n't prove i 'm a liar .
i was calling soggy a liar , once again proving you are a fucking moron .
not everything is about you twat
now there is a nice " non sexist " term .
glad you could stop by the misogyny thread and drop that little bomb for us all to witness .
i have a theory .
misogynist lefties use the words " twat " and " cunt " as insults because they feel sexually inferior and are actually afraid of real women ( and they have mommy issues ) .
anti women , anti gay , racist bigots ?
you just described the __name1__ !
conservative women are like skin @-@ head __name1__ .
i hold the same opinion of both .
a skin headed __name1__ ? ??????????
i did n't know there were __name1__ __name2__ @-@ nazis .
news to me !
idiot !
thank goodness for the internet then , since the news is there for you .
<a __name1__ ( reuters ) __name2__ an israeli __quant1__ __name3__ eight jewish teenagers on sunday for __name4__ out __name4__ @-@ nazi attacks in a case that sparked revulsion in a state that was a __name3__ for jews __name5__ the holocaust . </a>
__name3__ tel aviv district court judge zvi gurfinkel sentenced the teenagers __quant1__ aged __quant2__ to 19 , __quant3__ between __quant4__ and seven years in prison for a " shocking and horrifying " year @-@ long spree of attacks that targeted foreign workers , __name2__ __name1__ orthodox jews and homeless men . </a>
yeah , you !
this is what you get for trusting a new organization that is known to have islamofascists infiltraters in it .
you do n't remember the __name1__ fauxtography scandal ?
__name1__ green footballs - fauxtography updates </a>
your " jewish " __name1__ @-@ nazis were n't jewish !
surprise !
__name1__ jawa __name2__ __name3__ jewish __name3__ @-@ nazis ? </a>
<a href="http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/news.aspx/81429"> non __name2__ jewish idf soldier found __name1__ be __name1__ @-@ nazi - inside israel - israel news - israel national news </a>
congratulations !
you just got your ass kicked by this " stay at home " woman .
that 's because the lot of them were " tittie babies " unable to get off their addiction ...
wtf is wrong with you ?
you do n't recognize self @-@ hatred when you see it ?
i hate myself ?
the must explain why i come here to have my iq lowered just by reading things like the stuff written by you !
well , obviously you are n't a conservative female in this mode
__quant1__ years old ; wife , homemaker , mother of __quant2__ ; has never worked __quant3__ day in her life in a " business ".
i 'm not even sure that she 's ever voted .
her wedding vows included the words .....
" with this ring i thee wed . with this body i thee worship .
with all my wordly possessions i thee endow ."
or of the quiverfull variety or you would n't be neglecting your domestic duties prattling on about men 's business , like politics and worldly affairs .
do you leave yourself in a state of complete dependence on men for anything outside of the household ?
if not , you are not a true conservative woman .
you have some feminazi equality mumbo jumbo in your poke .
you 're an idiot and can n't read .
i already addressed this .
so this is __value1__ you get your ass kicked by a conservative woman !
while i agree with the premise of your comments ; that conservative women are definitely a group that it is acceptable to attack in our society ; your analogy has a major hole in it .....
__name1__ is about as conservative as __name2__ .
conservative women are individuals like my sister @-@ in @-@ law ....
that is a conservative woman .
not some half @-@ baked , ego inflated pta mother who can n't even keep her own home in order , nevermind actually carry through on the term of her elected office .
excuse the bleeding hell out of me ? ?????????????
are you telling me that only women who stay home and bake cookies are conservative ? ???????????
are you really saying that with a straight face ?
dude , i 'm a stay a home mother now , but __quant1__ worked plenty in my young married __quant1__ .
i worked full time , took care of a baby , and a house .
i had to , we could n't afford for me to stay at home at the time .
there is nothing in your wedding vows that says a woman can n't work and there is even a proverb about how the good wife works .
she works both in and out of the home .
right now , i 'm planning to go back to work since i have __quant1__ kid who is now an adult , and the other is practically in high school ( __quant2__ more year and she will be ) .
there is nothing in my wedding vows that says otherwise and i have my husband completely behind the idea ( hell , we can use the dough ) .
is anyone going to even try to say i 'm not conservative ? ???????
you just do n't know what you are talking about .
proverbs __value1__ @:@ 10 @-@ __value1__ ( __name1__ )
10 who can find a virtuous woman ?
for her price is far above rubies .
11 the heart of her husband doth safely trust in her , so that he shall have no need of spoil .
12 she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life .
13 she seeketh wool , and flax , and worketh willingly with her hands .
14 she is like the merchants ' ships ; she bringeth her food from afar .
15 she riseth also while it is yet night , and giveth meat to her household , and a portion to her maidens .
16she considereth a field , and buyeth it : with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard .
17 she girdeth her loins with strength , and strengtheneth her arms .
18 she perceiveth that her merchandise is good : her candle goeth not out by night .
19 she layeth her hands to the spindle , and her hands hold the distaff .
20 she stretcheth out her hand to the poor ; yea , she reacheth forth her hands to the needy .
21 she is not afraid of the snow for her household : for all her household are clothed with scarlet .
22 she maketh herself coverings of tapestry ; her clothing is silk and purple .
23 her husband is known in the gates , when he sitteth among the elders of the land .
24she maketh fine linen , and selleth it ; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant .
25 strength and honour are her clothing ; and she shall rejoice in time to come .
26 she openeth her mouth with wisdom ; and in her tongue is the law of kindness .
27 she looketh well to the ways of her household , and eateth not the bread of idleness .
28 her children arise up , and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her .
29 many daughters have done virtuously , but thou excellest them all .
30 favour is deceitful , and beauty is vain : but a woman that feareth the lord , she shall be praised .
31 give her of the fruit of her hands ; and let her own works praise her in the gates .
i thought __name1__ treated women with the uppermost respect .
if you have proof to otherwise show , i would like to see it .
bwahahahaaa ! !!!!
__quant1__ words !
" you ought to put some ice on that ! "
as i suspected , you have no proof otherwise , because there is no proof , only accusations .
__name1__ cheated on his wife .
you dont cheat on your wife if you respect women , yourself , or your marriage .
what does a liberal do when anyone brings up __name1__ .
bring back the " nuts and sluts " defense !
thank you for making my argument .
the old male chauvenist double standard .
__name1__ was a hero for getting booty .
anyone woman who caused him a problem was a slut !
exactly what i said .
thanks for backing me up !
ah , yes ....
the poor ....
..... <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_12news.html"> __name1__ jones </a> !!!
none of those sites refute my original story .
the original story describes specific crimes committed against foreign workers , ultra @-@ orthodox jews and homeless men .
further reading .
note the non @-@ correlation with your links .

so far , i 'm not really feeling that ass kicking .
and as a liberal and a feminist , i support your decision to be a stay at home woman .
and if your husband should die or empty out your accounts and take off with a floozy , i would still support your decision by supporting programs that would allow you to stay at home with your children instead of placing them in daycare and working to support them financially .
yet i do n't think you support those same programs , which is what makes conservatism anti @-@ woman .
dumbass , these " __name1__ " were people who immigrated to __name2__ and caused problems for them .
they were not " __name1__ ."
try reading comprehension .
man , this is a damn stupid thread .
the media made fun of __name1__ because she 's stupid .
not because she 's conservative .
there are many , many conservative women that have in fact been given all kinds of undeserved praise by the right @-@ wing specifically because they are conservative .
many people hate these women , but not any more or less than many people hate women on the liberal side of the fence .
women like __name1__ , or __name2__ , or __name3__ .
in fact , i have seen extremely hateful comments about all these women on these very pages .
in fact , i 'd be willing to wager that with a little searching , i could find comments such as these made by the op.
bwahahahaaa ! !!!!
that depends on whether they agree to outside affairs , so once again , you have no proof and loving dozens of women does not mean you do n't respect every one of them .
ever get anything of substance , do tell .
it was long ago .
maybe it was a sigline picture .
but you got busted for it .
and now you 're here feigning outrage at the same sort of thing .
show an iota of integrity for __quant1__ in your drab wretched oxygen wasting life .
you are an absolute liar !
show an iota of honesty and produce the evidence .
you 're even changing now where the picture was .
__value1__ it 's the avatar and now it 's in the sigline ?
you just made that up to change the subject because you knew the liberals were losing in this thread ( as usual ) and you had to change the subject .
and you talking about honesty and integrity is like __name1__ lecturing others against lying and adultery .
losing the thread ?
i 've got you now defending calling women __name1__ .
how do feel about calling __name1__ a prostitute ?
calling her a media whore ?
do you think that 's about the same as what __name1__ said ?
you are the biggest laughable liar .
show me where i called a woman a __name1__ ?
you brought up the subject of nazis .
i simply addressed it !
now you act like i brought it up ?
__value1__ you go from telling the the preposterous lie that i put __name1__ in cross hairs .
a complete lie .
now you are going to the hysterical liberal tacitc of the __value1__ degree .
asking question after question that has nothing to do with me , as if i have to justify myself to you !
( what a joke ! )
you are a laughable loon .
i am supposed to answer a bunch of laughable accusations when you have n't even produced the evidence for the __value1__ laughable accusation ? ??????
where is the evidence i ever put __name1__ in crosshairs ?
still waiting , you laughable partisan hack !
if they were n't __name1__ , what were they ?
__name1__ , christians , hindi , atheist ?
just because they are __name1__ immigrants does n't mean they are n't __name2__ .
where does it state they are n't __name1__ ?
and sorry , working outside of the home especially after having children and not being a member of the slum classes is an explicitly liberal philosophy .
are you sure you are a conservative ?
you do n't follow links and read !
ok , and this <a __name1__ sheva article </a> indicates that he was n't __name2__ jew .
but what about the other __name1__ @-@ __name1__ ?
a non @-@ jewish idf soldier who immigrated to __name1__ from __name2__ was arrested wednesday and found to belong to a __name3__ @-@ __name3__ organization .
during the subsequent police investigation , suspicions arose that the __quant1__ may have immigrated to __name1__ using counterfeit documents .
however , due to the complex nature of __name2__ 's __name1__ , it is possible that they arrived legitimately .
the law , modeled in response to the __name1__ , gives anyone with even __quant1__ __name3__ grandparent the right to receive automatic __name2__ citizenship .
the interior ministry said it was checking into the matter and will consider revoking the citizenship of the __quant1__ if they indeed used fraudulent documents , but warned that such action is complicated from a legal perspective .
more on it here :
what it boils down to is these people immigrated to __name1__ for the precise reason of causing trouble .
not everyone that lives is __name2__ is a __name1__ , and as the article notes " right of return " means if you have even the slightest heritage , you have the right of return .
under those auspices __name1__ could have immigrated since his grandmother was reputedly a __name2__ .
your bs article falls flat .
do n't trust __name1__ as a main source for your information .
obviously , you can n't read for comprehension .
the links i have posted have nothing to do with the soldier , dmitri bogotich , who was being investigated for heroin with the __name1__ @-@ nazi link being overseas and the assailants in my link , eli buanitov , part of a group that was discovered in the course of investigations of swastikas and graffiti coupled with assaults in whose very words illuminate the self @-@ hatred , " my grandfather is half __name2__ , so that this piece of trash won't have ancestors with even the smallest percent of __name3__ blood ."
the fact that there are multiple stories with different players kind of refutes the ridiculousness of such a statement , eh ?
as an aside , exactly what publications do you believe to be " uncompromised "?
if __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ are n't acceptable ?
nice try but this is about the " __name1__ @-@ nazis " case in __name2__ .
try again !
because " feminazi " was part of the criticism and ridicule of the __name1__ .
sluts was used to change the subject and attack anyone accusing __name1__ .
feminazi was not used to change the subject and suggest any woman at now __name1__ abortion or bringing sexual harrassment cases against school children was a nymphomaniac .
the " nuts and sluts " defense was used precisely to get the heat off __name1__ " couldn't keep it in his pants " __name1__ and make the victims of this horndog seem to be the " guilty party ."
so comparing women to __name1__ is acceptable if it 's on topic ? ?
are you telling me that only men were __name1__ ?
in other words , nycarbineer , you keep repeating the same gibberish .
you repeated it again .
that 's what teapartysamurai is showing you .
the term feminazi is directed at the adherents of feminism , an ideology that is ultimately premised on marxism .
it 's not now and never was a derogatory term for women .
it applies to male adherents of feminism too , you know , limp @-@ wristed , leftist men .
now do you intend to go on pretending that the term applies to gender and not ideology ?
i can see that it ain't wise to mess with teapartysamurai ; she wields a punishing categorical logic and a wicked right punch line .
but it 's all flying right over your head .
__name1__ is conservative ?
really ?
really ?
conservatives have obviously been redefined , as everything else seems to have become .
recent stats show approximately __value1__ % of women aged __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ have at least one unplanned pregnancy in their lives .
so the __name1__ wants to force half the women in __name2__ to have an unwanted child .
__value1__ href="http://mochamanual.com/mochamanual/trying-to-conceive/are-your-fortified-the-facts-about-folic-acid-what-every-black-woman-needs-to-know.html"> __value1__ you fortified ? </a>
<a href="http://mochamanual.com/mochamanual/trying-to-conceive/are-your-fortified-the-facts-about-folic-acid-what-every-black-woman-needs-to-know.html"> the facts about folic acid : what every black woman needs to know | trying to conceive </a>
so the answer is to kill that many children ? ??????????
i had an " unplanned " pregnancy .
my hubby and i wanted to wait until he finished college before having kids .
did n't work out .
we were the adults .
we made the kid .
we were n't going to make the kid pay for our " unplanned " pregnancy .
we did what we had to so the kid could be born and supported .
did it ever occur to you morons that the way to avoid " unplanned " pregnancies before marriage is simply say nooooooooooooo !
sure as hell worked for me !
liberals !
there is no such thing as being responsible or taking responsibility for one 's actions .
nope !
their answer is drag a kid out with a vacuum and cut it in pieces while it 's still alive !
liberals !
disgusting irresponsible vermin !
great you made a personal choice that worked for you .
that personal choice doesnt go beyond the players in that situation .
but then again i am quoting a social conservative hypocrite
i would love to hear how you figure i 'm a hypocrite .
this is gonna be good !
notice liberals keep throwing accusations my way with no evidence ? ?
that 's the definition of a liberal that 's losing the argument .
they want to desperately put you on the defensive , and they hope something will stick and put you on the defensive .
it 's so obvious !
as for " that choice does n't be beyond the players ."
what the hell does that mean ?
that abortion goes beyond " personal choice " because the __name1__ is so invested in it ?
what does that mean ?
this rationalization , i have just got to hear !
i 'm sharpening my claws now .
be my guest !
my memory is good enough to recall the time you got in trouble over on __name1__ for putting up an avatar that was a picture of __name2__ ,
with a crosshairs superimposed on it ...
what ? ????????
okay , you are full of it and a liar !
my avatar was __name1__ holding a gun , remember ? ????????
you let me know when you have evidence otherwise .
this is why you got banned from __name1__ .
this crap .
you are the biggest paid liar on the internet .
on top of that , how would that be misogyny , even if i did do it , which i did n't , i 'm a woman you moron !
come on teapartylady .
fess up ! !!
your not helping the op 's case .
oh , like you 're the one to judge ?
like you help your side calling me a twat ? ??????
real progressive there , plasma !
im not a progressive twat .
my stances on issues tend to run case by case , and trust me , i am vastly more conservative that you ever will be .
if i had a dime for every liberal who claimed to be " more conservative than i am " i 'd swear i 'd buy __name1__ 's website !
are you still posting over there ?
now we have __quant1__ sock puppets .
this is why liberals are double and tripling down on __name1__ .
same reason .
they are terrified of a conservative women who can kick their asses .
they do n't know what to do .
when they stop even discussing the issue in the op and just start making baseless accusations and insults , you know you have won the debate .
but then __quant1__ knew that several hours ago .
yeah , and i 'm posting under the nick of dagooseman .
the next time you are on __name1__ , just flame the heck out dagooseman and tell everyone you know it 's me .
it 's cool , i won't mind ......
i am praying for the __name1__ @/@ __name2__ ticket .
please __name1__ , let it happen ...
same here .
debate anyone ?
i 'm a woman , you idiot !
just because you can n't look at an attractive women without objectifying her , do n't include me !
the picture is supposed to be of of fearless samurai .
you can n't look at it without drooling , that 's says more about you !
thanks for letting us know that !
as we can see from this thread , you are an imbecile who can not back none of your lies up .
being a women shows you disrepect your own gender by displaying them in soft porn .
and that says a lot about yourself , not about me .
lmao !
how easily she gets confused .
i think we see the imbecile .
as for " lies ."
when you have evidence of my " lies , " let me know .
put up or shut up .
the evidence is your inability to prove your lies by backing them up .
it is you who needs to put up or shut up up .
just because i slamdunk you braindead liberals back to the stone age does n't constitute a " lie ."
you have failed on every lying accusation , loser .
it just means you can n't come up with anything else to refute my argument but the usual liberal baseless accusation .
it just means you are a liar who cannot prove her point , and lost this thread by being an imbecile .
as for your charges of soft porn .
i think that says far more about how you view strong women , than anything else .
attempting to hide your disrepect for women is laughable at best , and fully ignorant of how women want to be protrayed .
sorry , but you tried the typical sexism card you libs pull out to attack men and it backfired because i 'm a woman .
nothing backfired liar .
you are still a liar who cannot back up your accusations , and an imbecile so stupid she does n't realize she lost this thread .
in other words , you are lying loser .
lmao ! !!
but , as usual , with liberals , when something backfires , they never are intelligent enough to admit they goofed .
they just double down on the same stupidity and leave no doubt with anbody how without original thought or intelligence they are .
that sounds like you loser , unable to prove even __quant1__ point with your dishonesty and lies .
in other words .
i because i beat you and your mind can n't accept that happened , " i must be lying ."
the sad part is , i bet you think that really works .
notice again , people !
when liberals cease to even discuss the op and just make baseless accusations against you .
they are admitting they have lost .
that liberals think only a man can win the election ?
as we can see , the ignorant imbecile does n't even know when she is lying .
that makes her a habitual liar .
put up your supporting evidence or shut up loser ! !
it means the choice doesnt go beyond you , your husband ( or man you are with ) and your doctor .
nobodies else 's opinion matter .
i dont care what the __name1__ has invested in abortion .
the choice is not yours to make unless it concerns you .
my life does and never will concern you .
if my wife and i decided we didnt want the child at this moment and went the abortion route , it is our choice .
i dont need to ask your permission , nor hear your opinion on it .
if you felt you needed to state or stop us , i would not be above just decking you .
stay out of other people 's personal affairs .
i dont give a shit if you get hit by a bus tomorrow , your life is meaningless to me , and if you choose to keep or abort a child has no impact on me whatsoever .
this is my opinion and stance , not a progressive , not a liberal , nor a democrat policy .
they do not speak for me , just like you will never choose what i can and can not do with my body .
how are you a hypocrite ?
answer these for me .
are you against government removing transfats ?
smoking bans ?
and other nannystate type situations ?
see someone like you is for making a law banning all abortions .
you want to use government to limit peoples rights and freedoms .
you will say its for the children blah blah , but the reality is you want your morals imposed on others .
oh , this is going to be easy !
i can destroy you by pointing out __quant1__ little fact .
it was liberals that made a federal law " banning ."
not social conservatives .
you see before __name2__ v . __name2__ , each state had their own laws on abortion in accordance with the __name1__ of the constitution .
it was not until __name1__ v . __name1__ when __name2__ " jane roe " ( who later admitted she lied about being raped ) went to __name2__ ussc and __name2__ ussc violated __name2__ __name3__ making a federal law from __name2__ bench .
thus , liberals banned the right of the states to decide on this question , which is their legal right per the __name1__ .
over turning the unconstitutional , __name1__ v . __name1__ bans nothing .
it simply returns the question to the states , where it resided before __year1__ .
thus , your argument about my " hypocrisy " falls flat because it 's built on your own ignorance regarding the constitution and the origins of __name1__ v . __name1__ .
that also collapses your " it does n't go beyond you or your husband ."
no , sorry .
the question goes to the __name1__ as noted in the __name2__ .
you want to try again , and make it even more obvious how badly you just lost on that issue ?
you seriously have to be one of the most stupidest fucks ever to walk this earth .
this wasnt a state right issue you fucking waste of air .
this was about your personal belief that you would create a law banning abortion .
liberals didnt ban abortion you motherfucking twat , which is what we are talking about .
not your pathetic attempt to move to goal posts like you always fucking do in your attempt to debate people .
this is why nobody ever talks to you .
you just move your argument around in circles never actually landing on a point .
if i could time travel i would go back in time and pay your parents not to have you , and thus saving the world of your stupidity .
omg ....
the motherfucking irony .
what an idiot .
did n't you earlier say this debate was n't about me ?
now you want to make it about you ?
ill take this as a no.
i figured you would pussy out .
pussy out ! !!???
that 's misogynist ! !!!!!!
you should say she would ' out in a gender non @-@ specific genital way '
she tucked tail and hightailed it out of here due to being a dumbass
and what do you want liar ?
i would think __name1__ would punish anyone who said anything of the sort .
they are #1 and __value1__ 'm sure they would want to stay there .
i do n't know anything about __name1__ .
strange then that __name1__ called senator __name2__ a " prostitute " and a " whore ", because she did n't vote the way he wanted her to , yet he was never punished for it .
__name1__ is a tragedy slut .
-@ __name1__ , __name2__ , __year1__ @-@ __month1__ @-@ __day1__
link where you got that quote ? ???????
what do you bet , that 's not forthcoming !
conservative women do n't understand the glass houses analogy
and misogynist leftwingers do n't understand the concept of a double standard .
how many male candidates have been attacked with accusations that their children were not their own ?
have you missed the last __quant1__ years of the __name1__ political scene ?
a candidates sexual adventures have always been fair game
bwahahahaa !
the burden of proof is on me ?
i did n't make a claim on what is in the constitution !
nice damn try you dumbasses !
carbiner claimed the __name1__ found in the constitution that a __value1__ st trimester fetus has no rights .
where is that in the constitution ? ???????
i 'm still waiting !
the burden of proof is on you .
you make the claim that __value1__ st trimester fetuses have no rights and the burden of proof is on me ? ???
that 's as stupid as when __name1__ got caught with those fake __name2__ records and claimed his accusers had to prove they were fake .
the sad part is , i bet you think that works !
you asked someone to prove a negative .
you need to re @- take debating 101 .
[ quote=teapartysamurai ; 3700200 ]
yes .
right after you tell me whether or not it 's acceptable to use that sort of , as the op calls it , misogynistic rhetoric against __name1__ .
you claim it 's wrong for __name1__ to talk that way about __name2__ .
is it wrong for __________ to talk that way about __name1__ ?
oh nice try !
in other words you will provide proof , after i accept a premise not in evidence ? ??????
did you think that was going to work ? ???????
i must accept your laughable premise without proof , before you will provide proof ?
this is why you got banned from __name1__ !
why are n't you there now ?

no , no , no this comes to your __name1__ hotel room and does it right .
there ’s nobody that ’s going to look at her and say oh my gosh you ’re with a whore…
__name1__ :
that may be folks , that may be , the most expensive prostitute in the history of prostitution , and she ’s bragging about it .
__name1__ bragging about a $ __quant1__ payoff from __name2__ to get her vote on this healthcare scam on saturday night .
there 's audio on the link provided .
the entire quote :
__name1__ : that may be , folks , the most expensive prostitute in the history of prostitution , and she 's bragging about it .
__name1__ bragging about a $ __quant1__ payoff from __name2__ to get her vote on this health care scam on saturday night .
greetings .
it 's great to have you with us .
it 's __name1__ week and the __value1__ wave of the __name2__ clan begin arriving this afternoon .
i always look forward to this week .
__quant1__ look forward to this time of year , every year .
it 's one of my favorite times of year .
hello , folks .
800 @-@ 282 @-@ 2882 if you want to be on the program .
the e @-@ mail address , <a __value1__ elrushbo@eibnet.com </a> .
let me ask you a question .
how many votes did __name1__ get for his __name2__ seat ?
how many votes did the __name1__ senator from __name2__ get for his seat ?
zero .
they were both appointed .
the senator from __name2__ , __name1__ , said over the weekend he would gladly lose his seat to pass health care .
i told you people this .
i told you the __name1__ are going to thin the herd .
they are gladly willing to lose members .
everybody 's talking about this , " oh , no , it 's a horrible thing that happened on saturday ."
folks , it was a fait accompli .
nobody was going to vote to not do a debate .
i mean , even __name1__ voted for this , and he 's not going to vote for the final bill .
now , when you hear a __name1__ go on television and solemnly pronounce , as senator __name2__ did : " no health care if no change in public option and abortion funding , " or __name3__ , " i will not vote for this as it is written , " they are not espousing core beliefs .
they are simply opening bids .
they are simply making opening bids to __name1__ .
__name1__ has now shown that she can get paid off ; other people are going to have their price .
so when they come along and say , " i 'm not going to sign this thing as it 's written .
why , i 'm not going to put my signature on this !
i won't vote for it if there 's a public option in there .
i 'm not going to vote for this if there 's abortion funding , " that 's just bs . that 's a signal to __name1__ .
that 's just their opening bid : " what will you give me to vote for this thing ?
how much will you give me to change my mind ? "
who will write the escape statement : " i voted against it before i voted for it ."
this is classic what 's going on here , and it 's right out in the open for everybody to see .
let 's see , who voted for this ?
__name1__ from a stretcher practically ; __name2__ , who we 're never even allowed to hear talk because he has n't recovered from his stroke ; that stooge senator who replaced __name3__ .
how many votes did he get ?
the senator who replaced __name2__ , __name1__ ; and that moral paragon , of course , __name3__ ; and __name4__ from __name5__ .
that 's the __name1__ who was appointed to replace __name2__ .
a lot of no @-@ votes guys and here they are voting on something like this and here they 're going to be voting on it again when and if that vote ever takes place .

that 's your problem with depending on liberal webistes that take out of context or edit .
problem is , i 'm a 24 @/@ 7 member and have access to the entire quote .
it 's pretty obvious __name1__ is saying the whole damn party male and female are prostituting themselves for their vote on healthcare .
like __name1__ was any different trying to sell __name2__ 's seat ?
nice try !
you want to compare ideology then ?
i am willing to take the bet .
oh , another sexist term .
thank you for once again reminding us how " progressive " liberals are !
how exactly does that context change the meaning of the quote ?
did __name1__ actually specifically call anyone else involved a " whore " or a " prostitute "?
no , he did n't , just her .
and __name1__ was also using the term slut in the context of her being a prostitute for the right @-@ wing , not in terms of her sexual mores .
therefore he was saying the exact same thing that __name1__ was , he just used the term " prostitute " instead of " slut ", which is equally misogynist .
well damn !
do n't take away their right to call women twats , cunts , whores , sluts and to trash their bodies and looks .
that would be almost like castrating the poor assholes .
after __quant1__ yeas of __name1__ , massive increases in unemployment insurance payments , increases in welfare recipients , and __name2__ , you 're gonna go there ?
wow .
__name1__ has n't had a __name3__ __name2__ for __quant1__ years .
and ironically , all of __name2__ 's failures have been because he contined __name1__ policies .
0 bama signed the bills of " unpaid for expansion of entitlements ", did he not ?
you blaming the auto pen now ?
the hypnotist who keeps making him sign those is a __name1__ .
i am not a dumbfuck
thats it !
libs believe in that channeling shit ...
it must be the reason !
" a boom for the megarich , and a bust for the nonrich and the country , another jingo war or two ...
if the __name1__ were to win the presidency and both houses this __month1__ , what could we expect ?
1 . war with iran : __name1__ candidates are already beating the drums that we must use force to end the threat of a nuclear __name2__ .
diplomacy is for pussies
2 . further isolation of __name3__ : __name1__ did not respond well to __name2__ food for demilitarization program .
expect it to end
3 repeal of __name1__ : no replacement , just repeal .
__quant1__ __name1__ without access to affordable care , people with preexisting conditions thrown out
4 gutting of __name2__ : elderly __name1__ will be given __quant1__ allowance for health coverage .
if it does n't keep up with rising costs ....
too bad
5 extension of __name1__ tax cuts , additional tax cuts for the __value1__ percent while the lowest __value2__ percent would see an increase
6 reductions in federal student loans : making it harder for working __name1__ to send their kids to school
7 increased harassment of __name2__ __name1__ : show me your papers
8 increased subsidies for oil production while killing green energy provisions
9 creationism taught in schools .
evolution downgraded to an unproven theory
10 .
global warming officially declared a hoax
11 .
gay marriage repealed and __name1__ reinstated
1 ) i do n't think anyone on whatever side wants war with __name1__ ...
but i do n't think appeasing or using words will keep them from obtaining nukes and i could see bombing or supporting __name1__ bombing , if they keep on the path they are..
regardless of what party is in control ...
2 ) fuck __name1__ and any country like them ...
isolate them more and more , no skin off my nose
3 ) damn straight repeal __name1__ ....
and work on true reform and further opening and deregulation of the healthcare @/@ insurance system ...
more competition , more group access , brings down prices and increases choices
4 ) gut __name1__ ? ?
no.
streamline , cut costs , and keep those on it taken care of ...
look at ways of finding a differing solution for those in the workforce now so that __name1__ is not their only option when they retire
5 ) $ 0.01 over nothing is of course an increase ....
no citizen should have been paying a zero amount or even getting more out while paying nothing , in the __value1__ place ...
flat tax , no exemptions , no loopholes ...
6 ) the __name1__ has no business being a lender for student loans ...
you want a loan , seek it out , it is your responsibility ...
the __name1__ is not your bank nor your guarantee for funds for you as an adult going to college
7 ) absolute rubbish ...
put proving you are a citizen ( regardless of race ) should be required for all voting , jobs , etc
8 ) fuck subsidies ...
that is not a charge of the federal government ...
and while we 're at it , cut out all government handouts
9 ) where the fuck do you see this ?
stating that evolution is but one theory and teaching the theory while not stomping on other theories that may or may not be based on intelligent design or whatever is not having creationism taught in schools and evolution thrown out ...
yet another typical scare tactic by you
10 ) man @-@ made global warming is a hoax
11 ) get government out of marriage except in areas where government belongs , such as taxation , power of attorney , inheritance , etc...
and i have already made my personal beliefs on open homosexuals in the military ...
but i do not see __name1__ re @-@ instated
thanks dd
you basically supported everything in my op.
this is what a __name2__ __name1__ looks like
well..
clarified and exposed the rhetoric bullshit you try and interject
it might look like the __name1__ of old that had a backbone instead of the spineless libtard __name2__ view we have today .
that 's what i thought too .
i kept looking for something to disagree with and did n't find it .
rightwinger fail ....
ssdd ...
nice comeback
shows the considerable thought you put into your posts
thanks for contributing
you 've been ignoring " thoughtful posts " the entire thread ...
why would i want to waste the time ?
more rightwinger fail ...
keep it coming , boy ...
given that you never actually contribute anything to a thread , i can see why you crave attention
good post house .......
we really need your input ......
thanks for all you do
this is where rightwinger posts his usual " none of you people can refute my claims " and announces his interweb victory ....
the truth is , now that __name1__ went to __name2__ the race is all but over .
the problem is that all of the candidates are flailing around like a chicken with their head cut off .
too stupid to know they 're dead , but determined anyways to do as much damage as they can on the way out .
if if if the nomination process ended tomorrow , __name1__ might stand a fairly good shot at beating __name2__ .
but the longer this goes on , the worse his odds get .
you think you could polish __name1__ 's ass with your pompoms any harder while you lick his boots ?
there is no way in hell the kenyan will win reelection , no matter what happens during the __name1__ primaries .
__name1__ will lose in a land slide .
eh .
i do n't think he deserves to win .
i 'm planning on voting for __name1__ in the general .
the problem is that everyone is so concerned with winning the nomination , they 're poisoning the well in the general .
when you have a vicious hard fought primary in battleground states like __name1__ and __name2__ , you have a lot of work to do to win back your own divided base and the moderates who just watched you sling mud with sickening precision .
now , if the nomination process ended soon , __name1__ could start repairing the damage he 's done to himself in this process .
but the race keeps going , keeps traveling to battleground states where he keeps damaging himself just to win .
the general is n't a lock for __name1__ , but if you 're thinking it 'll be an easy win for the __name2__ you 're quite frankly insane .
__name1__ is going to fight hard , his proxies are going to fight hard , and right now the __name2__ nomination process is doing their work for free .
the longer this goes on , the more likely an __name1__ victory will be .
i totally disagree with your thoughts on all levels .
i do n't believe any damage at all is being done the __name1__ candidates .
i think this election cycle is making them tough and ready , and nothing i 've seen or heard is making me dislike any one of them .
i 'll back which ever one wins .
the only people that are parroting this " the __name1__ are hurting themselves " bull shit is the liberals , so i think you 're either gullible or here spreading crap .
you 're free to have your own opinion on it .
one thing you can n't deny is that this process is flat out wasting money that should be spent in the general .
__name1__ means that __name2__ is going to have huge cash store in play and a pretty effective group of proxies .
deny the damage done by the negative ads in the battleground states if you want , but even if none of that sticks come the general , the money spent is gone .
wasted targeting the other __name1__ candidates , and not __name2__ .
if __name3__ wants to win , he desperately needs to get back on to attacking __name1__ and off of going after __name2__ .
but that is n't likely to happen as no one is dropping out .
did you type that with a straight face ?
he is the very embodiment of the social __name1__ of the right .
he personifies the " greed is good " catechism that was put on steroids during __name1__ 's time in office , and is the very truest standard bearer of reagan 's legacy .
granted , he has a habit of being a bit more abrupt , or forthright about his " screw them " attitude , as his disconnect from ordinary __name1__ is way more loud and proud than it was back in the day , but the overall intent is totally on target .
you all can rest assured that you , too will be fucked over in a __name1__ administration the same way __name2__ fucked you or your parents .
by ' greed is good ', i take it you mean he 's a successful , self made multi @-@ millionaire with a great head for business ....
yea , __name1__ forbid we elect one of those to run this country ...
much better to elect idiot after idiot .
yes , someone who did work their way up from humble beginnings to become a big success would be a good candidate for president .
how much money did __name1__ 's dad leave him in his inheritance ?
how much money did __name1__ 's dad leave him in his inheritance .
funny how you equate success with being born rich and staying that way .
only conz could think that being born on __value1__ means they hit a triple .
envy is n't a virtue deceptious .
__name1__ is not conservative .
he is __name1__ , through and through , which makes him much closer to __name2__ and __name3__ than to being a conservative .
he is neither fiscally nor socially conservative despite the rhetoric he is employing to get him the nomination and a shot at the presidency .
unfortunately , there is too much of this " anybody but..."
mentality .
if only we had someone that cared about this nation , liberal or conservative , who would run .
if we did , we might actually survive as a nation .
it is not the philosoply that is our problem .
it is the person behind the philosophy .
immie
itll take a true __value1__ rd party nominee ( i.e . __name1__ ) to truly change the conversation .
unfortunately that also takes money and backing from the rich and powerful .
right now , they are doing very well with the __quant1__ parties they have .
they are not going to cut their noses off to spite their faces .
work ?
well ...
yeah , i guess you could say he worked it .
is not relying on family , friends , and charities an abdication of personal responsibility as well ?
you tell me .
no , that is what they are there for .
__name1__ is more interested in his " states rights " issue even after a " national " disaster .
how is it a " national " disaster ?
if only __quant1__ state was hit yet as much damage and death took place , would it no longer be a " national disaster " in your eyes ?
do you know what a republic is ?
do you have any idea why we are referred to as the " unites __name1__ "?
oh , so now it must have the official " national " disaster label before yo uare ok with our federal government helping out your fellow citizens ?
really ?
wow ...
dont be a dick .....
i simply asked why it was labelled as a national disater .
i do n't see how anything you 've posted disproves what i said .
he 's talking about private citizens .
are you saying private citizens are not the purview of the __name1__ gov't ???
i 'm saying that it 's not the __name1__ government 's responsibility to give money to those hit by natural disasters .
is n't it interesting how libertarians ' desire for " freedom " correspond so neatly with skinflints who do n't want to give anyone , anything .
so while libertarianism attracts people who want to be " free " it also attracts cheap assholes who do n't want to pay their fair share .
perhaps when libertarians figure out a way to differentiate between the __quant1__ , i 'll vote for them .
what a disingenuous hack you are .
libertarians @/@ conservatives give waaaay more voluntarily that you do through the force of government .
you cry about " paying their fair share ", all the while ignoring the fact that we voluntarily give more than you propose to take .
the reason you libs want to forcibly take from others is that you look in the mirror and know that you would n't give of your own free will .
you project your shortcomings on everyone else in order to make yourselves feel better about your own tightwadery .
fuck you ! !
__quant1__ more example of a callous conservative .
who was it that claimed libealism was a mental disease ?
oh yeah , __name1__ , a conservative radio host whose rants are reflective of the the anger expressed by guyp .
im sorry but i agree with him .
the people should have insurance .
rental insurance is cheap like 200 __quant1__ year or less..
if you own a house you should have insurance..
no excuses..
i used to rent and had rental insurance .
please explain to me how rental insurance gets you clothing , water , food , shelter , transportation , etc. right now , when these people need it the most ?
apparently you do n't pay attention to what people post..
private charities are down there making sure people get what they need .
as __quant1__ poster pointed out - restaurants are handing out free food , local stores are supplying free gloves , hard hats , people are going down there to volunteer , people are donating money to fund the effort..
the federal government is not needed - they are not the only solution .
when people need help - the help comes from good people - not the ugly federal government .
besides , we do n't need politicians throwing money at a community while they scratch their bellies then say ; " remember me in __month1__ - you owe me ."
consistent .
it likely wont .
but i bet not one would go hungry or without a roof if government was not expected to help out .
government gets in the way ...
__name1__ help __name1__ ....
we always had .
now ?
governemnt red tape gets in the way .
really ?
so , why did we have __quant1__ homeless veterans in the __year1__ data ?
are n't our service personnel especially near and dear to the hearts of the right ?
do you have one living with you yet ?
if not , why not ?
you dont know me well enough to make that assumption .
i share a mortgage on a home that i have never lived in nor do i collect rent on it .
__quant2__ have been paying __quant1__ __quant2__ month for 8 years for it ...
that incluides real estate taxes .
i have never net the folks that live there ...
i am anaonymous ...
my attorney handles everything .
the foiks that live there are veterans and their families .
sure ...
you can say " it is an investment "...
and in a way , it is .......
for when the time comes , i will sell it off .
but for now , people are enjoying the conmfort of a roof over their head .
fyi ....
there was a lien put on the property because the people did not pay their water bill for __quant1__ years .....
so i paid it without questioning .
so what do you do for your fellow man ?
just criticize them for being like you ?
i take care of a __name1__ veteran .
i call him " dad ".
as for providing a roof , i applaud you , but until you provide concerted care and have to pay out of pocket for it all , go cry to your " attorney ".
i can n't afford one .
__name1__ is there and even the governor said they have more food and clothes then they can handle right now with churches and other groups sending it..
transportation you should have auto insurance..
i get what __name1__ is saying .
thats what a hardcore libertarian would say .
but the rest of us are thinking about the people that do not have insurance and @/@ or need help right now .
kind of hard to build a house over night , __name1__ .
kind of hard to import food considering that the stores are probably wiped out too .
how does one survive until the insurance( hopefully by a respectable company ) claim comes through ?
how does one survive when you have the funds but the people you need to buy the goods from has no address ?
i know , you get into your pickup and drive over to the next town-- if you can find your damn pickup ! !
__name1__ is not opposed to private charity .
so nice straw man .
he is opposed to charity from the government .
in the words of the right , a government handout .
the government can n't perform charity .
it 's an impossibility .
the very definition of charity requires voluntariness .
charity has to be provided of one 's own free will .
the government , by definition , acts through the use of force to take from people .
there is nothing voluntary about it .
is reading really this difficult ?
i have n't seen any libertarian on this board or thread speak out against donating , in fact i 've read the exact opposite .
is n't it interesting how libertarians ' desire for " freedom " correspond so neatly with skinflints who do n't want to give anyone , anything..
feel free to quote one of us who said nobody wants to give anyone anything .
i have a feeling we 'll be waiting for your reply for quite a while .
he 's just a kid , there 's no point in trying to reason with him .
there is no reason children and teens can n't understand such concepts .
they will never become adults until they are treated to the same standards .
i dont see how it is government charity when the government forces the tax payer to give it up .
of course you do n't .
because it 's not .
that is not self responsibility ...
that is telling victims .....
fuck you
sorry , but my country is not like that
no looking to the federal government to provide a solution is telling people " fuck you ."
if you really cared you would do more than just pay your taxes and look to your government for a solution every time disaster strikes .
i bet it 's pretty easy to sit on your ass and point to the government..
i would call that arrogant and snug ...
paying taxes is n't good enough ....
not to mention the majority of those assholes who sit there snug , who point to the government for solutions do n't pay taxes anyways..
once again liberalism is a mental disorder ...
here is the way disaster relief works
if your house burns down , you are responsible for repairs along with whatever insurance and local charities wil pay
if there is a massive fire in your town , you still pay to fix your house , but the state will step in to provide additional assistance along with national charities
in a major disaster affecting a large region , the federal government steps in along with the state to provide disaster relief .
national charities still provide individual assistance while the state and federal government provides grants and low cost loans to allow you to get back on your feet
so explain this ...
if my house is struck by lightening and burns down ....
why am i not afforded the government grants and low cost loans ?
how does " widespread " affect anyone individually more than " __quant1__ home affected "?
you see ...
when you hgave government pick and choose , nothing is done fairly .
when the people pick and choose , everything is done fairly .
so , you agree with __name1__ , that the government should have left it up to the localities to clean up their mess ?
if the government was not there to help them , i guarantee you , __name1__ would be there to help .
we , as a collective of individual __name1__ donated more money to __name2__ than all other countries combined .
i am not referring to government aid that was sent ....
individual donations from individual __name1__ collectively donted more than all other populations of all other countries combined .
our government didnt make us do it .
we did it becuase we wanted to .
the problem with the left is they dont think __name1__ care about other people , so they feel government needs to take our money and donate it for us .
they are wrong .
i think that its more they do n't care for other people .
so they dont expect others to do something they dont themselves do .
instead they have calculated that if they look like they care about others , we will give them more power , and sadly we comply .
exactly , they want to look like they care , however when push comes to shove they start pointing fingers .
i suppose it 's easy to talk but it 's harder to act , and these twats are too fucking lazy and cheap to do a fucking thing .
as the old saying goes " talk is cheap ."
it 's amazing how people do n't see progressives for what they are ...
no i did n't .
i have been talking about disaster relief moving up from local to state to federal .
each has it 's own role .
__name1__ is city government and they were on site since the planes hit .
federal government did not have assets or personnel staged in __name1__ and it took them longer to arrive
the federal government played a major role in the rebuilding of lower manattan after __name1__ @-@ __name1__ .......
we could not have relied on private charities
actually , i questioned you as to why you feel it is ok for the federal government to offer individuals grants and low interest loans when in a wide spread disaster and not offer the same to individuals who suffer similar losses but not in a widespread event . ,
you never answered ...
you went inmto something about the need to clear roads , re build schools , etc.....
things i didnzt question .
but when it came to what i questioned ?
nada .
so answer my question .
a man who works in a city __quant1__ miles away , loses his ho , e to a tornado that rips uyp the town he lives in . he still has a job becuase the city was unaffected ...
but he lost his home .
becuase it was widespread , he gets a low interest loan .
in the meantime , a man who works from hoime loses his home to a fire caused by lightening .
now he not only lost his home , but he lost his place of business .
but it was not widespread , so he does not get federal assiatnce .
why si that ok with you ?
why do you hate people that work in their own home ?
personally .....
i agree with you and would have no problem with individual homeowners who suffer a catastrophic loss being eligible for low cost loans or tax write @-@ offs .
i believe our right wing and __name1__ would go ballistic though
as to why we differentiate ...
i did give you a potential rationale
good question .
it may be a question of magnitude once again .
if your house burns down , you still have your job .
you still have a community structure around you .
what happens when your entire community is wiped out ?
your job is gone , friends and neighbors who would have helped you before , now have their own problems .
is a bank going to help you when you do n't even have a job anymore ?
is a bank going to invest in a community that has been wiped out ?
the government will .
those loans not only help you rebuild your house but help your boss rebuild his business , help rebuild schools and bridges and roads
personally , as a citizen , it makes me feel good to know that my government is there to help people in need .
when i see us troops helping our people in a disaster area it makes me proud to be an __name1__
in any case , when major disaster strikes , i am happy that the __name1__ people are there to help those in need
i love how you progressively can be pushed into conservative or even classical liberal ideas and then the next day you rest yourself like a watch and we do it again ...
it 's almost like you 're a closeted conservative ...
__name1__ is local government .
you moved the goal posts from fed to local .
i do n't believe most progressives even understand the difference between the state and federal government .
most are too fucking stupid to hold a job - what makes anyone believe they could rationalize the constitution or even the __name1__ .
progressives are like gigantic babies ...
" ma , ma " " government , government "
so one thread wasnt enough ?
rdean has to make another one to blatantly lie ?
im hardly going to be accused of being a __name1__ fan , but he 's right that the federal government has no authority to be involved in disaster aid .
apparently , rdean thinks that because he wont help them personally , no one else will .
beautiful to see states stand up against the intrusion of the federal government .
speaking about the governor of __name1__ turning down funds to help people who have lost everything , even family members .
gee , who said that you swine .
it is beautiful to see states stand up to the intrusion of the federal government .
it 's not my fault you lack the integrity to acknowledge that there are other ways of providing aid .
nor my fault that you dont want to see real charity .
rdean , he said federal aid , not help in any form .
when you get to know rdean more , you will realize he does n't really care .
avatar , the fact is there is no intrusion , it was stated that federal involvement would complicate matters at this point .
it always does .
read your link and watched the video..
at no point does __name1__ say tornado victims should fend for themselves ( let them die at work ? )
another rdean lie .
its a dean thread .....
he titles the thread totally different than what the story says .....
he has a half a dozen of them out now .....
dean would be a great news reporter .....
they do the same thing ....
spin the story .....
you can n't be serious .
no relief for disaster victims is one of __name1__ 's most popular spiels .
go to __name1__ and do a search on " __name2__ against __name3__ ".
you can watch him rail against disaster relief till your heart 's content .
how is it possible for you guys to have so little knowledge about your presidential candidates ?
you seriously scare me .
dean he admits in the story he bad mouths __name1__ ......
so what else you got ? ....
media of persuasions act in a similar manner .
yeah , __name1__ 's __name2__ effort was an epic performance .
upgrade that unit .
__name1__ under __name2__ was in itself a disaster .
we all know that .
fact is that __name1__ and __name2__ under __name3__ works very well .
look it up .
each state cannot prepare for a mega disaster .
having the federal government prepared to bring disaster relief where it is needed is more cost effective than __quant1__ states preparing for a disaster that may never come
look at the massive fires in __name1__ and __name2__ last years .
those states cannot afford to keep the manpower and equipment on hand to battle __quant1__ of square miles of fire .
the federal government is able to bring in personnel and resources from around the country
why exactly can n't each state be prepared for a mega disaster ?
look at __name1__ .
do you think __name1__ alone could have prepared for that ?
lousiana only has __quant1__ people .
__name1__ cost approx $ 110b in damage .
that means each resident would be responsible for approx $ 25k worth of the damage .
that is unrealistic
loisiana is one of our poorest states .
they also get much more federal aid than they pay in taxes if they were expected to be responsible for all the disaster cleanup they would have gone bankrupt .
as it is ......
all __name1__ helped them in their time of need and that is the way it should be
that is n't how it works , dingleberry .
you brought up how well they work under your supreme leader .
now let 's see some insttances where that is true .
i 'll wait .
and that 's because the state governments have ceded too much power to the feds .
if we fixed that problem , the states would have significantly more resources and be able to help themselves .
that and they think there is " free " money available , of course they are going to ask .
i think they would be better off without the feds .
this is part and parcel with you guys .
you are looking to break up the __name1__ .
ain't happening any time soon .
__name1__ .
read all about it .
__name1__ __value1__ big __value1__ __name2__ washington post </a>
but __name1__ wants taxpayers to pay for his airplane trips and then he bills his supporters too ....
umm ...
no.
lulz .
having been in direct aid to vt , and ny myself , the only reason __name1__ was even remotely effective is because of class __value1__ ground work by the states .
oh , and the fact they did n't have to actually consult with states they just moved right in thanks to congress giving them broadened authority .
without local know how , they would have botched the deal just as bad as __name1__ .
hence , they are not really worth having adn should dismantled to the state level .
we have national guard for when the statre requires tactical help such as __name1__ .
if that 's all __name1__ has going for it , it is n't much at all .
__name1__ __value1__ get aid | 11 alive.com </a>
nuts .
my heart goes out to the people in tornado alley and i have no problem with my tax dollars going to help the survivors rebuild their lives .
classic __name1__ .
at least in __name1__ 's world the tornado victims will have legalized drugs and prostitiution to comfort them .
a democrat speaking out against personal liberties , while speaking in favor of spreading the wealth around , not so rare anymore .
there 's neocons who pretend to be conservative but do n't care about budgets and spending , and neolibs like __name1__ who pretend to be liberal but hate the idea of personal liberties .
ok paulestinian ...
__name3__ ron paul takes double reimbursements on travel expenses __name2__ capitol hill __name1__ business insider </a>
__name1__ are fucking heartless .
you are such an emotional little twit , derp .
there is no authorization for the federal government to do the things you want it to do so you can feel good .
usurping the constitution every time you turn around is n't good for it ( adherence ) or the people ( dependency )
if you want to me to put it in comparable terms , __name1__ are fucking spoiled babies .
i do n't believe your ridiculous proposition has ever been before a court , but if you 're looking for precedent i can help you ...
in __year1__ , when a massive drought afflicted __name2__ farmers , __name1__ categorically refused to grant federal aid to the victims .
he issued an eloquent written justification for his decision : · __name1__ ’s words skillfully represent the contrast between the effects brought about by the voluntary generosity of private parties and those created through the exercise of the coercive powers of government .
private individuals , when not hindered by government intervention , have a choice in how to allocate their funds among the various purposes that they deem to be of importance .
sorry ....
but your argument is a fail
__name1__ was acting as chief executive .
the fact that he told flood victims to fuck themselves has no constitutional bearing
it was a drought , not a flood , and if there was no constitutional authority then , there is no constitutional authority now .
i am afraid there is constitutional authority to help __name1__ in times of need .
again , the __name1__ clause allows congrees to do what they determine is in the best interests of the general welfare of the people .
it has been used for a __quant1__ years and upheld by the courts
libertarians who only look out for themselves may not like it ....
but it is the law of the land
__name1__ is an authorized federal agency .
if you disagree with it 's constitutionality , you are welcome to challenge it in court
what is the policy on federal disaster aid for tornado damage ?
insurance should cover most losses .
are we going to cover multi @-@ car fog accidents ?
i had ice storm damage last year .
where 's my check ?
i do n't see how __name1__ is wrong .
__name1__ have big hearts , and can donate on their own accord .
also , the state governments have natural disaster plans .
some of you just love the nanny government ...
the question is why .
bitching about __name1__ during __name2__ , then getting on here and posting about how great federal aid is , does n't make perfect sense to you ?
why not ? !?!?!??!?!
because __name1__ would have done quite well with __name2__ ....
but __name1__ was a racist .....
and he wanted to control the balck population ...
so he intentionally impeded femas success .
everyone knows that ...
how come you dont ?
great point , boy do i feel like a dummy
all the individual changes __name1__ personally made to __name2__ , truly heroic .
the __name1__ clause does n't mean what you think it does , you should read what __name2__ wrote about it , after all , he wrote the fucking thing .
seems to me that the great ultra advocates of states rights tried all this once before and they got their asses kicked .
it was a good thing that the president of the __name1__ back then was a compasionate man .
maybe it was to bad he did n't go with , to the victor goes the spoils .
for those who seem to be such strong proponents of the consitution ...
you sure seem to forget quite a bit of how it reads .
refresh your memory .
we the people __name1__ the __name1__ , in order to form a more perfect union , establish justice , insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defence , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity , do ordain and establish this constitution for the united states of america .
with all of the posts from the teaparty or rightwingers there is __quant1__ common thread .
my money .
everything else is up for grabs
that 's a lie .
all the gov't cuts we push for , we want you to get the same tax reduction benefits that we get .
i do n't want you to be forced to pay for certain gov't programs i like , which is exactly what you promote and advocate for .
you want me to pay for what you want , i want you to receive the same tax deduction that i get .
what 's the more selfish position there ?
it is more selfish for those who have the means and the power to take more are selfish .
that is the true selfish attitude among this country .
really , if president __name1__ had taken everything from the south like the rightwingers and neo cons like to think today , it so would have been a different story in this land .
imagine !
former black slaves having the ground given to them that those awful slave owners had in their possession .
to the victor goes the spoils !
generosity is giving more than you can , and pride is taking less than you need .
what am i " taking " by getting to keep more of my own money i earned ?
selfish is demanding gov't pay for your programs , even when ppl do n't want to .
generosity is voluntarily giving money on your own free will , robbery is taking money and giving to others against their will .
seems pretty common sense to me .
i wish there was a way for kooks like you to be tagged so that we could quit protecting you from terrorists and not help you during natural disasters .
when you whine about the __name1__ killing terrorists overseas , we could just single you out here for terrorists to find you while leaving us alone , because " you do n't like your tax dollars killing terrorists overseas ."
also , we can just tag you and your personal goods for not being supported when a natural disaster hits your trailer .
the feds will just say , he did n't want us to find him a place to sleep after the tornado sent his trailer airborn .
what 's the difference between wanting you to be taxed more in order to pay someone else 's home insurance costs and wanting you to be taxed more in order to pay for __name1__ ?
if millions have a disastrous medical issue , like cancer , or hundreds or thousands have a natural disaster issue , what 's the difference ?
should n't your " principles " lead you to support __name1__ ?
if people need help , just assume charity and local gov'ts are n't enough and just tax everyone else to pay for it , what 's the difference ?
but ...
but ...
but ...
that 's different ! !!
that 's about the answer i expect .
if an ice storm takes down power in a state @/@ city for awhile , causes massive wrecks , etc then many times governors ask for federal help .
driving on an icy road and wrecking is n't a federal problem until it affects thousands of people .
a town being leveled is a wee bit more serious than you losing your car in a fog wreck .
you can have __quant1__ cars damaged in a wreck and it still does n't equal the damage of people losing their town/homes/businesses/lives from a tornado going for miles .
insurance will cover most of the damage but a town being gone causes havoc like loss of normal services to actually live .
the feds should only help the state and city officials get things stabilized then leave , not hang around like with __name1__ giving out money to people .
the ice storm here was very widespread .
no aid .
so the government has a policy or just picking winners and losers ?
every winter driving on icy roads affects thousands of people .
try again .
ok paulestinian ...
__name3__ ron __value1__ flies first class on __name2__ money ap story __name1__ lawrence __name4__ - youtube </a>
try again , junior .
so now you believe __name1__ ?
unlike partisan boobs i do n't discount what 's said simply because of the network , newspaper , or website it was said on .
__name1__ is certainly no fan of __name2__ , but did his job and debunked a false story .
kook , insurance companies will rebuild a home , but they cannot turn on the electricity , shelter people , keep law and order , when a town has been destroyed .
you are so fucking stupid .
__name1__ is not the same as the feds propping a city back on its feet .
you kooks think any help by the feds is illegal .
i hope you lose your home ....
that would be justice .
well are n't you just a paragon of class ?
i notice you have nothing to say about your little airplane story being debunked .
imo we ( __name1__ ) are all in this together .
as individuals we cannot do enough to mitigate the misery of our fellow countrymen when disaster strikes .
this ideology , libertarianism , seems little different than the ideas expressed by utopian __name1__ more than __quant1__ century ago .
they are nice in theory , but reality will always get in the way .
let my tax dollars be used to help other __name1__ in need , and anyone - business or individuals - who hope to profit from the misery of others are no different than looters and should be treated as such .
yes , very little different from the utopian __name1__ .
we even think think if our ideas are implemented there will be " anti @-@ lions " that you 'll be able to ride around on .
i did n't realize the __name1__ was worried about someone passing __name2__ to someone else sitting on a bus with them .
you have such a simpleton mind that i 'm amazed you have n't been run over by a lawn mower yet .
hopefully you are sterile .
the internet exposes you kooks hiding in your trailers .
enjoy voting for the founding father of __name1__ and still holding a straight face while you tell everyone how conservative you are .
thanks again , have a great day
if i recall you 're only __quant1__ years old .
i suggest you live a little longer before you broadcast your opinions as anything more than that , or characterize someone like me as a " lib ".
using " lib " as a pejorative , in effect suggesting all " lib " s are the same and hold only far left opinions is abject ignorance .
__quant1__ 've been on this planet for twice as many years and more than you , and experience counts .
i believe universal preventative health care should be provided to all __name1__ ; i believe in gun controls ; i believe the war on drugs and the war on poverty have failed ; i believe in fiscal sanity ; i believe in the rule of law and that our constitution is a living document ; i believe cu v . fec is the greatest threat to our democratic traditions and to our republic ; i believe violent criminals need to be incarcerated in prison and if paroled should be supervised for life ; i believe drug offenders need to be punished for their crimes and treated for their addictions ; i believe all __name1__ between the age of 16 and 32 should should provide __quant1__ years of service to the nation ; i believe in the rights of states but the rights of all __name1__ are supreme ; and , i believe that all __name1__ have a duty to vote and that any effort to place roadblocks to their exercising this franchise as well as anyone who votes fraudulently should be punished upon conviction by incarceration .
see , i can write all of this without attacking you personally or using an emoticon .
you can thank my ' liberal ' college professors at __name1__ for this ability .
i can also defend my beliefs in appropriate threads , and would enjoy debates with those who disagree and can do so without the use of emoticons or logical fallacies .
well i am glad to finally read a few things that you disagree with __name1__ on .
however , i do n't see how someone can be against the war on drugs and support fiscal sanity and support __name1__ , when his views are the exact opposite on the subject .
wanting a guy who gets in a bar fight supervised for life seems awfully extreme .
most of the views you just posted are liberal , so i 'm not sure why me calling you a liberal resulted in this kind of a response .
i consider people , at least in a fiscal sense , liberal if they support big expensive government programs .
like the ones you listed , and like this one on this thread that gonebezerk adamantly defends .
__quant1__ years of medical practice and sound investments in gold and silver , that 's how .
idiot .
__name1__ has not be a practicing doctor for __quant1__ years .
it 's more like __quant1__ years .
and a good deal of his professional career has been spent in __name1__ .
the __decade1__ 's were __quant1__ years ago ?
i 'm older than i thought .
after earning a __name5__ degree from __name6__ in __year1__ , and completed his __name6__ internship at the __name1__ in __name2__ and his residency in obstetrics and gynecology at __name3__ @-@ __name3__ in __name4__ .
[ 10 ] __name1__ served as a flight surgeon in the __name2__ from __year1__ to __year2__ and then in the __name3__ from __year2__ to __year3__ .
[ 11 ]
__name1__ and his wife then relocated to __name2__ , where he began a private practice in obstetrics and gynecology .
[ 12 ] he refused to accept __name1__ or __name2__ payments ; he routinely lowered fees for patients who could not afford to pay .
[ 13][14 ]
__year1__ to __year2__ is __quant1__ years ...
he has n't practiced since the early 90 's at the latest , but sallow 's claim was that he had n't practiced in __quant1__ years which was inaccurate .
the __name1__ is opposed to contraception for moral reasons .
where is the morality in creating a life when food and clean water are rare commodities ?
where poverty exists and educational opportunities are non existent ?
where is the morality when disease is spread ?
where is the morality when a women is the victim of domestic violence ?
when a women is forced to conceive and then trapped as the child become a lever to gain more power and more control ?
" aw , fer crissakes .....
we 're just talkin ' about a lil ' job - security , here ! !!!"
the __name1__ speaks to all of these things , dumbass .
it also speaks out against the death penalty .
next !
i am with you .
if you cant feed , house and take care of a baby you have no business having one .
yup , if you can n't provide for the child do n't have it .
if you can n't provide , do n't get pregnant .
personally , i 'm a fan of contraception .
as far as your questions about the morality of other issues , i would bet the __name1__ also views those as important .
however , when it comes to the soul and the physical being , in the __name1__ 's eyes , the soul trumps the former .
and , they have always wanted more souls to watch over .
fill that basket , you know .
not my view , either .
but , i 'm not the church .
and , i have no interest in telling the __name1__ what to do ( as if they 'd listen anyway ) ; i just cast my ' vote ' concerning the __name2__ with my feet .
but , as i am a big fan of the constitution , i sure as hell do n't want my government telling the __name1__ or any other religious organization what is kosher to believe and what is n't .
if the __name1__ believes that the soul is more important than the physical being , that is their prerogative .
( i won't be joining them or ' going back ' anytime soon , though .)
so , in your opinion , a church which engages in animal sacrifice or practices polyandry @/@ polygamy should be beyond the reach of law ?
actually , i 'm a fan __name2__ __name1__ and agree with __name2__ scotus on what few limitations we place on it .
food and clean water are rare commodities ? ?
not in this country they are not .
the church is a global institution ....
or have you missed the __name1__ charities commercials with the starving children in __value1__ world countries with no water , food , shelter or education ?
oh yes i 've seen the commercials .
but i do n't trust everything ad i see on tv .
when you force women to have children they may not want , in many cases they become dependent on the state for services such as medicaid , food stamp , welfare , the foster system , etc etc.
hey ! !
if you 've got some other way to keep some uppity @-@ woman ( who won't play by __name1__ ' s rules ) in her place , " conservatives " are open to any @-@ and @-@ all suggestions ! !!!
there is a difference between disallowing a behavior and forcing someone into a behavior .
that 's not responsive to the question .
and to suggest that members of the __name1__ are always wise and just disregards history .
if you 've got some other way to keep some uppity @-@ woman ( who won't play by __name1__ ' s rules ) in her place , " conservatives " are open to any @-@ and @-@ all suggestions !!!!
are you trying to suggest all conservatives are religious ?
if so you should rethink that angle .
__quant1__ can tell everyone that many years ago contraception was an issue for our family .
we couldnt afford it .
the result was a beautiful baby boy .
the little cuss is now 6'1 " married has is own house and works for __name1__ .
so the church is disabllowing its members from using birth control , the punishment for doing so will be the loss of entry into heaven .
how is that different than forcing a behavior ?
hold on .
what country are you talking about ?
food and water are scarce ?
educational opportunity is non @-@ existant ?
i know you 're not talking about __name1__ .
if you talking about another country than that 's the country 's problem , not the church 's .
the __name1__ are against contraceptives because they want as many members as they can get .
it has nothing to do with morals .
please see syreen 's post above , it is clear , concise and convincing .
now , if that does n't knock her off her chair i 'll give up .
*passes totally out !
i 'm in favor of feeding , clothing , and giving shelter to the poor .
i 'm against all the gov't institutions that tax our brains out and who inefficiently attempt to provide some of these things .
if that were true , you 'd have a point .
but it is not , so you do n't .
another fail .
you 're on a roll !
good luck with that !
rick will be proud .
it was a question , not a statement of fact .
the church does prohibit birth control , does it not ?
is the use of bc something one must confess to return to a state of grace ?
if this is true , one must conclude ( if they are honest ) that such is a form of power and control over the freedom of the individual , for without grace entry to heaven is problematic .
as said by many , if you can n't afford __quant2__ dollar for a condom , you have __quant1__ choices .
1 ) keep it in your pants or 2 ) keep your legs closed ...
depending on you sex .
to force a church to go against its beliefs just so some poor fool can have sex without danger of getting a girl pregnant makes so little sense i can n't believe people here are even defending it .
the redirect to world poverty ...
water shortages ...
the church ....
not a single word said about the idiocy of someone that poor thinking about mating .
if you want to take away religious freedoms , you better come up with a better plan then ' but __quant1__ can n't afford a $ __quant1__ condom '
maybe churchs shouldnt operate hospitals then .
if they have a problem with performing or providing certain services that are part of that business model , then maybe they shouldnt be in that business to begin with .
why would an intelligent person get involved in a business in which parts of it could violate their beliefs ?
that would be like a devout __name1__ opening a liquor store but refusing to sell booze .
i guess i should have editted in ' business discussion or hospital running to the redirect comment in my original post
wry 's point is ....
that not suggesting or providing contraceptives in countries like this , only exacerbates the problem that they are trying to fix .
why would you support giving birth to more babies into such desperate squalor .
good grief , stop it .
now i must give you a positive rep.
you have already passed me out..
please do n't try an kill me off .
the church is not the one who decides who goes to heaven or hell .
the church 's doctrine does not permit birth control but it does not use any force to get the congregation to comply .
they leave that up to the individuals own conscience and consequence .
wow .....
you white - trash red - necks are pretty , fuckin ' stupid .

no you 're not a genius , though the ability to hold two contradictory beliefs suggests something , something other than genius .
parse you __value1__ paragraph and maybe you 'll understand my point .
alright , by all means please use your liberal mind to help my simple brain understand this concept .
i willingly give money to charities to help the poor+speak out against gov't institutions that take away the aspect of choice and are n't as efficient as charities=i 'm against giving money to help the poor , even though that 's exactly what i did .
please please help me understand that equation .
the __name1__ has an agenda .
they wholeheartedly disagree with the idea that goveernment can dictate via law what an enterpsie can and can not sell .
if the product or service is legal , they should be allowed to sell it .
if they choose not to sell it , that should be their choice .
that is the crux oif the debate .
it happens to be contraception right now ...
but all along the agenda is the same .....
government has no right to tell anyone that they have to sell anything .
i think the crux of the debate is people understanding that contraception ( as provided by health care providers ) will not " free ."
it will be included in the cost of your original premium .
thus they can not charge an extra co pay or fee for .
there are other services this applies to as well , such as mammograms .
now ...
should all men who pay premiums demand that women pay for their own mammograms since 99 % of men do not get them ?
the way health ( and really all ) insurance works is that you pay a premium for access to services .
when you pay your premium and do not receive any services , you area subsidizing someone else 's services .
so every month i pay premiums , i help to pay for some guys viagra , or some womans pap smear , or some kids physical .
should i be raising hell that they should be paying for those services themselves ?
but your insurance contract will not allow for that .
call your insurance company and demand that none of your premium dollars be used for any services or treatment you disagree with and see what happens .
take a pill so you can fuck your brains out is not the same thing as getting a mammogram to see if you have cancer .
do n't be fucking retarded .
the crux of the debate is that the state went into a church and directed them to do something against their faith .
you get all hot and bothered when that same state invades your bedroom .
it is very revealing of your __quant1__ @-@ facedness you do n't mind it invading a church .
although you can take that same pill to control acne and hormone levels as well .
not all women use the pill as a pregnancy prevention device .
it 's real simple : get the hell out of everybody 's bedroom and start worrying about the economy .
this contraception thing is nothing but a new shiny object to distract the easily distracted and unfocused republicans .
all you say is true ....
but you need to remember ...
it is insurance ...
so whereas someone else uses viagara , and you dont , you have the policy just in case ytou do need viagara .
it is like flood insurance .
i have it , but never used it .
my premium is paying for the poor guy that had to make a claim .
i am ok with that .
if i werent , i have the right to call another insurance company and try to get a better rate .
but again ...
the real topic is the mandate ...
" all insurance companies must offer the service "...
it is government intrusion into an iundustry .
i understand why government says you cant sell somethiong for it has been found to be dangerous ...
but to force someone to sell something ?
it is not ok in my book .
and by the way ...
my wife and i enjoy sex ....
but we are done with having kids ...
so yes , we use contracption ...
in many varieties ......
i am not against contraception ...
i am against government mandating one must offer it ....
even if it goes against their personal morals .
weak .
you are shameless .
holding up a few people with medical problems as human shields so everyone else can get their fuck @-@ at @-@ will pill .
alcohol is used in medicines .
therefore , because of this sick guy over here who can n't afford his medicine , __name1__ should make colleges pay for students to get free liquor .
that is the kind of logic you are using , and the kind of logic __name1__ used .
how about we just help actual sick people instead ?
my god !
that might actually help keep health care costs down !
can n't have that !
so , you support taking away religious liberty .
nice .
idiot .
i 'm sorry , but how does providing abortions equate with healing the sick in a __name1__ hospital ?
i know of grocery stores who won't sell tobacco .
it 's their choice as to what services they will provide and what they won't .
at least it is in a free society .
where in the __name1__ does it talk about the church offering medical services ?
i dont remember that being part of the __name1__ doctrine .
this is some really weird retroactive time warp shit .
you seem pretty clueless to the fact that __name1__ hospitals have been around a long time and have not been violating their beliefs .
their " business model " has been thriving .
if you want to go the whole muslim route , then to make your completely false analogy a true __quant1__ , what __name1__ has done is force a muslim @-@ operated convenience store which has been around for more than a century to start selling booze .
and then here comes you , saying " gee , why would a __name1__ have a business model that violates his beliefs ?
i do n't get it ! "
if you rule that religious hospitals apply for exemptions to laws based on religious beliefs , you up a whole different set of issues than just the contraception issue .
i could make the argument ( in court ) that my religion prohibits me from providing cancer drugs , __name1__ drugs , heart drugs , or cholesterol drugs , or any other drug on the market .
would that be an acceptable consequence in your mind ?
has anyone ever done that ?
no ?
okay .
just keep making shit up .
in fact withholding lifesaving drugs by a parent because of their religion has been litigated , and the parents lost .
not the same thing as a hospital withholding care , now is it .
but keep trying .
i 'm sure there 's a slippery slope around here somewhere that is n't fallacious .
the child did not have t6 he choice to be brought upo by parents that woulde allow meidcal care ...
it had to be decided as it was .
one can get a job at a different hospital if they do not like the health insurance offered .
i dont see where providing free abortions is part of this discussion
i hate to break it to you , but grade school boys tall enough to reach the rubber machine on the truck stop bathroom wall can get contraception for next to nothing .
or you can go to planned parenthood where it 's passed out like candy .
you do n't need insurance to get contraception .
it 's readily available off the shelf .
actually , the whole " contraception " drum is being pounded by the liberals in an attempt at gotcha politics .
if one were being honest , they would know this is about constitutional freedoms rather than denying women " health care ".
but that is if one is being honest .
sometime rights come into conflict and they need to be resolved .
in this case it is the freedom of choice vs. the freedom of religion .
the courts will have a difficult time deciding this one .
if you rule for freedom of religion , you trample someones right , but if you rule for freedom of choice , you trample someone elses rights .
its a double edged sword .
as cruel as it sound , i would argue freedom of choice wins out on this fact and this alone .
the __name1__ is a secular society and not everyone believe in or follow religion .
now people are still free to choose which religion to follow , but ( in this case ) ruling in favor or religion would in effect make those of us who do not adhere to that religion forced to follow part of its doctrine .
opinions ?
but dont you get it ?
the __name1__ is fighting for freedom of choice .
they are fighting the idea that goivernment has the right to mandate that an insuirance company must sell a service ...
even if they dont want to .
ironically ....
they are fightiong for freedom of choice .
freedom of religion started iut ...
yes ....
but __name1__ " compromise " was to minimize freedom of choice for the insurance companies .
so now it is a fight for freedom of choice .
you are aware of course of all of the charitable work the __name1__ does in each of the areas you mention are n't you ?
wry has pretty much already told me in this thread that doing things charitably is meaningless , it has to be done by gov't .
the cathlic __name1__ could cure cancer and hand out the cure for free , but if there 's no gov't mandate involved , wry would n't support it .
lol , we both know you 're full of shit , that said , when you grow up your opinions will change .
the __name1__ is fighting for freedom of religion .
the left is fighting for freedom of choice .
you have it backwards .
the __name1__ is fighting on the basis of religious institutions .
where in the discussion has __name1__ , __name2__ or __name3__ / __name3__ come up ?
they havent raised any moral issues or issues of any kind with having to provide contraception at no additional cost .

do you and others believe the couple were unjustly found guilty and should not have been sent to prison ?
why is an abortion taking a life and praying over a dying infant and not calling __value1__ an exercise of religous freedom ?
what ?
do you see the word free in regard to abortions in my post you responded to ?
me either ?
i did mention a " free " society , which means free of government forcing you to provide services you choose not to .
i 've already asked and you 've clarified it .
even if you 're the most giving person to charity , unless you support gov't mandates , you are n't charitable .
i 'm doubting as i grow up i 'll become a partisan hack .
i realized both parties were shit in my teens , it 's shocking to me that others have n't .
partisan blinders always conquer common sense .
no sir .
you have it wrong .
it started as freedom of religion when the __name1__ complained .
__name1__ agreed and compromised .
however , the compromise meant that insurance companies can be told by government that they must offer something , even if it goes against their morals .
when has any business been told they must offer a service ?
it is about freedom of choice .
the left wants the people to get bc form any insurance company they want to ......
at the cost of freedom of choiuce for the owners of the insurance companies .
the right wants the inmsurance companies to also have freedom of choice ....
so sell it if you want ...
dont if you dont want to ....
take insurance with one that offers it or take insurance with one thayt doesnt .
freedom of choice is swecured for both sides the __name1__ way ....
freedom of choice is eliminated for owners of insurance companies the left way .
providing abortions for free are not part of this discussion .
unless somehow in your twisted mine the pill is equal to an abortion
no matter how much you keep telling yourself that , its not the essence of the debate .
show me where the health insurance companies are coming together to protest the contraception mandate .
they are not , it is the church and religious institutions involved in health care .
i didnt know they church sold insurance now ?
this is news to us all ....
you do realize that there is a difference between an insurance company and a health care provider right ?
if this was truly about medical health , then it would be about condoms and not the pill .
the women who need the pill for legitimate medical reasons are a tiny minority who would incur a very small cost to the healthcare system for their medication .
to use these innocent women as human shields is vile , disgusting , shameless behavior .
the rest of the women who want the pill would multiply the cost by a factor of __value1__ .
and so these women need to justify the expenditure .
they have not .
for these women , the pill serves no preventative medical purpose whatsoever .
in fact , a condom is far safer as it actually prevents the spread of disease .
but they did not ask for condoms .
and that is why they cannot hide the fact this is about subsidizing their sex life , which is a totally bogus argument for a handout .
so that is the end of that .
for the pro @-@ life camp , they do n't get off so easy from me , either .
for decades , pro @-@ lifers have been bitching about planned parenthood .
planned parenthood gets federal funds to hand out birth control .
most people , including pro @-@ lifers , are not morally opposed to birth control .
however , money is fungible and so when you give cash to pp for birth control , that frees up other monies which can be spent performing abortions .
while __name1__ is technically not funding abortions , it actually is .
for the life of me , i do not know why after all these years it has not occured to the pro @-@ life movement to open their own women 's clinics which can then be used to provide adoption services , pre @-@ natal care , and birth control .
and if __name1__ is going to be spending money on birth control regardless of whether or not you think they should , then these clinics should get that birth control money , too .
and there will not be any stain on that money abetting abortions .
this is __name1__ , and we thrive on free enterprise and competition .
time to wake up and get smart , folks .
what health conditions does condoms treat or prevent ?
i didnt know acne could be controlled with condoms , i didnt know ovarian cysts could be treated with condoms , i didnt know hormones could be regulated with condoms .
your issue is with people having sex for pleasure .
get over it .
some institutions are self insured because they make enough profit to cover the liabilities .
i find it much more interesting that the religious right pushes for abortion to become illegal , because life is sacred , while at the same time opposing universal health care .
its extremely hypocritical to say life is sacred when your willing to fight to protect an unborn life , but not willing to fight to protect people who have already been born .
actually , it is how this universal health care is implemented .
the method this adminstration is using is more of a corporatists venture in which the citizen is forced to buy insurance .
the preferred method for a universal health care is more of a socialistic venture in which everyone contributes to a fund to pay for the health care .
both methods have draw backs , the corporatist approach still institutes the insurance companies which will seek to turn a profit by short changing the policy--also , by forcing demand , the insurance companies can raise their rates to ensure more profit for their companies .
there is little reason not to do this since the competitive spirit of the free market is being challenged by the lack of choice including not buying .
the socialistic approach is still faced with rising costs in comparison to standard of living and the inefficiency of government .
pluss extra .
what is wrong with a system where everyone pays the same and everyone gets access to the same services ?
( i.e . single payer )
they are n't pro life ...
they 're pro birth .
if they were n't , they 'd be arranging adoptions for unwanted children .
if they were n't , they 'd be supporting day care and job training and education for unwed mothers
if they were n't , they 'd support __name1__ and head start .
but they are ....
because it is n't about " life ", it 's about punishing the harlots and making women incubators .
which is why something like __value1__ % of anti @-@ choice activists are men .
hmmmm ?
all of the church organizations providing such services would beg to differ with you .
feel free to google .
liberals and contraception .
what a laugh .
you people stick your dicks into anything moist .
life 's one big immoral party to asswipes like you .
buy your own rubbers asswipe .
tell that to __name1__
i thought it was __name1__ that started the contraception thing .
it was .
it was __name1__ that let __name2__ off the hook by being stupid enough to give the liberal media plenty of sound bytes that enabled them to shift the focus from __name2__ 's dumb fuck position on contraception to __name1__ 's dumb fuck position on contraception .
__name1__ is hugely involved in adoption services .
it also funds programs such as day care for single parents ( of either gender ) .....
we also provide school places , for kids from all faiths , and no faith ....
do n't let the facts get in the way , though .
i have given to __name1__ for many years and __quant1__ am not even catholic .
i guess there are dozens of programs for girls , and i felt the boys need a leg up as well .
perhaps __name2__ solution to this biological problem , that has become political , is for __name2__ __name1__ and __name2__ to finance some type of creation or solution that when added to our drinking water removed __name2__ sex drive .
i remember in the fifties conservatives did not want flouride added to the water because flouride turned people into __name1__ .
if they can create a flouride that makes people __name1__ surely they can come up with some kind of drug that destroys the sex thing .
what about that claim about a __name1__ plot ?
fluoridation was required in __name1__ as long as the __name2__ were in charge .
when the __name1__ disappeared and the country was reunified in __year1__ , fluoridation stopped .
it is prohibited in __name1__ now .
the claim is no longer made because it seems so ...
__decade1__ s .
but it was n’t far off

today we regard such practices as barbaric .
we prefer a nice sterile hospital room to leave babies to cry themselves to death alone .
sure ...
cause you know ....
so many kids are born in sterile hospital rooms and then everyone just leaves them alone and lets them die .
that happens so often .
if someone has a moral objection to contraception , women are going to be the victims of domestic violence as if no woman that has ever used contraception has been the victim of a abusive partner .
sue your high school __name1__ teacher .
lol , so true , and so sad .
for example , it 's okay for you to impose your value , because you are special ?
in your own mind , maybe , outside of it , the word may take on a different meaning .
neither government nor people should impose their values on anyone .
idea censorship is offensive to some , might want to consider the effects of what you advocate .
ideas are fine .
i am all for ideas .
but when they are of a moral or religious nature it 's not government 's business .
if you want to change society 's morals you appeal to the hearts and minds of the people that are willing to listen and if they embrace it what you find to be immoral will eventually die out on it 's own .
government forcing a moral or religious principle creates rebellion and in the end delays or prevents it being embraced by society .
history is pretty clear on this one .
actually it is not .
maybe in the past , arguably .
yet , today we fight over everything from the definition of marriage to when does human life start .
you might want to consider the distinction between principle , and dogma .
principle has every place in a civilized society , through culture , and law .
dogma , has none .
you got to admit it turned out to be an awesome trick to get conservatives to reveal even more of how ridiculous their beliefs are .
and as you get older and understand how the world actually works you will realize how stupid you sound .
either that or you 'll turn into __name1__ and move to __name2__ @-@ __name2__ .
legal codes enforce matters properly defined in philosophy as ethical or moral .
" thou shall not steal " is a moral imperative ( or a commandment from __name1__ ) and codified in the __name2__ of all states .
government does enforce morality .
laws against theft and murder were around a long time before __name1__ wrote them on a rock .
did we forget that __name1__ was forced to flee __name2__ for murdering someone ?
theft is illegal not because it 's necessarily immoral but because it infringes on the rights of others .
of course there were prohibitions against theft and murder before __name1__ , that was expressed in my post ( moral imperative ) .
can you clarify your remark , specifically , " theft is illegal not because it 's necessarily immoral " with an example of when theft is moral or amoral ?
moral theft ...
stealing the car keys off a drunk driver .
the __name1__ take on morality is theirs and theirs alone .

as to the food and water issue , the __name1__ alone , has done more to get more food and water to starving people then you have or ever will .
its there right to provide there employees what the will .
the point i made regarding food and clean water , as well as disease , was focused specifically on current events in __name1__ .
not only is the __name1__ opposed to contraception but the __name2__ adminsitrtion was opposed to any efforts to protect pregnanat women ( and their unborn children ) from disease - water born & __name3__ - and poor prenatal nutrition .
i have no doubt the __name1__ engages in good works and i have no problem with their moral objection to abortion .
what i object to , strongly , is stupidity .
how is preventing a child 's conception a moral issue and how is it any business of the __name1__ .
the answer is quite simple , more births = __quant1__ __name1__ = more power and money .
cause the __name1__ do n't come into your bedroom .
idiot .
a great many catholics do purchase and use birth control..
they 're smarter than obie wan though , they have enough sense not to demand that the __name1__ pay for it .
boy is he dumb as a box of rocks .
what the frack have you been smoking ?
the __name1__ administration expanded aid to __name2__ and threw a lot of money behind the effort to stop the spread of __name3__ .
he did a lot of things wrong , but that is one thing he got right , you should give yourself a wedgie for lying about it .
by the way , how is a preventing pregnancy not a moral issue ?
do you think it was immoral for the __name1__ government to sterilize people without their knowledge simply because many progressives thought it was a good idea ?
the __name1__ should concern themselves with trying to keep their house in order .
the pervert priests throughout the existence of the __name1__ should be of greater concern than what people think about contraception .
fortunately the __name1__ has been losing its power , and because of the pervert priest scandals , its money for some time now .
they are nothing more than hypocrites in a big way .
contraception is about responsible parenthood .
why would __name1__ choose to make it an issue in an election year is beyond me .
for some reason , anything having to do with sex puts them in a tizzy
__name1__ did not , and are not , making contraception an issue .
ummmmm ....
it seems they are
cracked that door a little bit and social conservatives came running through
__name1__ are against women 's health because they do n't believe government should provide them with free contraception with money confiscated by government guns .
you do n't think that 's making contraception an issue ?
seriously ?
all that for a little pill ?
that would certainly be a good example .
but more to the point that there are laws which certainly coincide with a " moral code " such as laws against murder or theft but the real sticking point is that those acts violate the rights of others .
people often make the argument that our laws are based on the __quant1__ commandments or are based on __name1__ @-@ __name1__ theology and that 's not quite the case .
only two ( arguably three or four ) of the commandments are enforced by law in the __name2__ and those that are existed in most societies long before __name1__ even entered the picture .
other laws based on a moral belief ( such as the __name1__ " crimes against chastity laws ") have been declared to be unconstitutional .
so what i am getting at is that government only enforces " morality " when it happens to coincidentally do so in the act of protecting the personal rights of other people .
i am sure there are exceptions that can be found and certainly there are still " moral laws " on the books , but for the most part they are rarely enforced or they get shot down when brought before the __name1__ unless they have some secondary purpose that overrides the moral purpose .
most crimes in the penal code - and other codes - have victims , and are therefore protecting the rights of others .
there are exceptions however , being under the influence of a drug or narcotic is one , a women exposing her breast in public is another .
are n't these examples of the government enforcing a moral code ?
__name1__ @/@ progressives like to have it both ways on issues like this .
they do n't really want the government out of the bedroom .
they only want that when it 's convenient for them .
they fully support the government forcing taxpayers to subsidize fellow citizens ' personal sexual behavior .
they also fully support forcing taxpayers to subsidize abortions .
so they 're not very honest or consistent .
it 's time for big government to really get out of the bedroom .
let the age of personal responsibility dawn .
no , they do n’t , because they know it ’s illegal to use taxpayers ’ funds to subsidize abortion .
so liberals do n’t want to ‘ have it both ways , ’ they ’re being perfectly honest and consistent .
if conservatives really want ‘ big government ’out of the bedroom and an age of ‘ personal responsibility ’ to dawn , then they need to cease their efforts to violate a woman ’s right to privacy with regard to abortion and access to contraceptives .
the hypocrisy and ignorance belongs to conservatives alone .
__name1__ href="http://www.factcheck.org/2010/04/the-abortion-issue/"> __value1__ abortion issue </a>
unless of course one is dealing with conservatives who oppose abortion for women in cases of rape or incest , or to save the life of the mother ; in addition to being ignorant hypocrites , such conservatives are also criminals .
juxtaposing abortions and bedrooms is a little strange , do n't you think ?
especially on top of the false claim that women are being denied access to contraceptives .
sex is optional .
you can either choose to have sex or knot .
if you choose to have sex you should act like a good girl and not a whore .
a whore expects others to pay for her to play..
so any woman whose insurance company currently covers birth control is a whore
thanks for clarifying
did n't say that tampon .
if they willingly pay for it that 's their choice , , forced is another matter..
but then we girls do n't expect tampons to know much .
clarifying ?
that one did n't make sense ...
even for you ...
seriously , if we oppose government forcing insurance companies to pay for contraceptives then we 're against insurance companies paying for contraceptives ?
the concept of free choice for both companies and consumers is n't even on your radar ?
i 'm familair with sex but did n't know the alternative was " knot ".
is that something one does with their so ?
oh !
i bet you meant twister .
knot is what some women do with their tubes .
insurance covers thousands of medications and procedures .
are they being " forced " on you too ?
these are private personal matters .
they are not government matters .
the government should not be involved with these issues at all .
have all the contraceptives & abortions you want , just do n't demand fellow citizens pay for it .
your personal sexual behavior is your business & responsibility .
fellow citizens @/@ taxpayers are not responsible for subsidizing your personal sexual behavior .
the government needs to get out of the bedroom once and for all .
read my several posts on how health insurance actually works and realize that you already pay for other peoples services .
and you raising issues with your health care provider already ?
making sure that none of your premiums dollars are going towards services you disagree with ?
not a government issue .
the government should not force anyone to pay for someone else 's personal sexual behavior .
have all the contraception & abortions you want , but pay for it yourself .
the government should n't be involved with these issues .
since the government is not providing services , your argument is invalid .
and im glad to see you skipped over the rest of my argument on how insurance works in general .
so i assume you are ok with paying your premiums to your health insurance company knowing that they provide abortions ?
some things i just can n't control .
i do n't like abortion but if health insurance covers it , than so be it .
but the government should n't be involved with issues like this .
contraception and abortion are private personal matters .
again since they are not providing it , i dont see how it is your concern .
would you as upset if they mandated that mammograms be provided at no extra charge ?
because thats part of the __name1__ as well .
man you need to go back and get an education of at least the high school level .
so lets use your car insurance analogy .
so you have car insurance ( mandated by the government none the less ) .
and you get in an accident and cause damage .
we 'll even take your liability case as an example .
the damage you cause is $ __quant1__ .
now youve only had insurance for __quant3__ years at a rate of $ __quant1__ per month .
so you in essence have paid $ __quant1__ into the insurance pool .
now where does the other $ __quant1__ come from ?
other peoples premiums ! !!!!
holy shit , so other people are actually paying for your mistakes .
you are correct in __quant1__ thing , and that is insurance helps spread the risk .
now if you have full coverage insurance and you get hurt , then your insurance company will pay out to yourself .
same example , if you have had insurance for __quant5__ year and have been paying $ __quant2__ __quant3__ month ($ __quant4__ __quant5__ year ) and get in an accident that is your fault and your medical bills are $ __quant1__ .
where does that other $ __quant1__ come from ?
ohhh thats right other people premiums ! !!!!
amazing , you dont understand how this works .
how does that disprove my assertion that buying insurance is paying another person to assume the risk ?
but you are wrong in the way it works behind the scenes .
i never said it was a fee based services .
i said you pay a fee for " access " to medical services .
that fee is called a premium .
you fail to understand that somewhere somehow the actual cost for your services is paid for by the pool of money the company bring in through premiums .
if an insurance company is paying out more in services than they are getting in premiums they current do __quant1__ things .
they drop those who cost too much to insure , or they raise rates to cover those services .
regardless , the money that actually pays doctors is from the pool of premiums that everyone pays .
hence you pay other peoples services every day of the week .
whether you want to admit it or not .
but the again the right isnt big on facts .
again , a premium is not so you have access to service , your premium is paid to another person so they assume the risk .
how the person , or company , deals with that risk is irrelevant , you are not paying them so you can access services .
hence , no one pays anyone for anyone else 's services ever .
this is the last time i am going to explain this , so feel free to blather your ignorance in assurance that i will not again explain why the sky is blue .
feel free to insist it is orange and declare victory if you like , it won't bother me .
everyone remember the sky is orange because syohon says it is .
time to get the government out of the bedroom .
no more having it both ways .
the government does n't belong being involved with such private personal matters .
and they definitely should n't be forcing anyone to pay for someone else 's contraception & abortions .
taxpayers are not required to fund fellow citizens ' personal sexual behavior .
it 's the individual citizens ' responsibility to fund their own behavior .
you want to be promiscuous and have several abortions ?
well then you have to take personal responsibility and fund that behavior yourself .
it 's not your fellow citizens ' responsibility to do that .
big government needs to be booted out of these personal social issues .
they 're clearly over @-@ reaching now .
i find this issue rather interesting myself .
the left yells and holler that they demand government to stay out of the bedroom and " private affairs " with respect to defense of marriage act and same sex marriage , yet they really do n't want government out __name1__ the bedroom because the left is now trying everything to connect contraception with the notion that it 's somehow a health issue .
it 's not a health issue in the respect that mamograms are , it 's just another " give me , give me " entitlement .
what exactly entitles government to give you free contraception , to in effect have taxpayers pay for your extracurricular activities ?
health insurance should be treated with various cover options with everyone that seeks to have health care coverage paying for basic services .
if you want the cadillac option that includes free contraception , free viagra , free gym membership and weight loss programs , etc. then that individual must pay for the added individual premium coverage for those desired programs .
government should stay out of issues such as these , period .
it 's not the federal government 's job to be and act as the " responsible " parent , because some complaining entitlement supporters choose not to be .
contraception is about family planning , not about wild sex .
you can have wild sex without contraception .
it is in the interest of the society that unwanted children be kept to a minimum .
it reduces the abortion rate , the number of children born to single mothers and the burden on society
as such , government has the right to require insurance companies , which make a tremendous amount of money off of our society to include contraceptive coverage .
we tried to implement a government insurance option and insurance companies spent __quant1__ to block it .
this is part of their payback
how about you worry about purchasing your own condoms .
if your dick falls off because you catch something because you put is some place you should not have , i give you my permission to blame me .
why not just make all contraception free ?
maybe do contraception bouquets at __name1__ or __name2__ .
totally free of course .
contraception is a right , correct ?
how many soldiers have died protecting your right to stick it where you want without having to take any responsibility ?
that is what liberty is about , after all .
there is nothing nobler that i can think of , than having the greater society take responsibility over who get 's born .
you are way ahead of the pack , comrade .
most contraception is used by married couples who are trying to responsibly control the number of children they have .
it is not about wild sex parties and sticking it where you want .......
it 's about responsible parenting
if insurance will pay for a vasectomy or tubal litigation ....
what is the moral opposition to birth control ?
insurance will pay for those because it 's cheaper than the costs associated with a baby .
it 's an economic decision for the insurance company not a moral one
agreed
complete bullshit .
it 's in an insurance company 's best financial interests to do so hence the reason why most of them do , but the government has no right to require that of anyone whether it 's a religious organization ( such as one run by the __name1__ ) with a moral purpose for not providing it or a secular company with a bad grasp of economics .
every progressive leader from __name1__ , to __name2__ to __name3__ feel just as you do
at the same time the government should not be forcing people to pay for other 's people 's contraception or forcing insurance companies to offer coverage for contraception if they choose not too
you pay for other peoples health care every time you pay your insurance premiums ....
are you protesting your current insurance company as right now ?
if it is dictated by the government it is not an economic decision , it is a political one .
still think the sky is green ?
still think you dont pay for it ?
hows that ignorance working out for you ?
you should step outside and look up , you might learn something .
you should finish that ged , it might help you be less of a wingbag
but it remains against the teachings of some religions .
it is our __name1__ right not to have the government force us to pay for something against our faith .
i do n't care how much ' wild sex ' anyone has ....
as long as i do n't pay for facilitating it or the consequences of it .
your rights do not outweigh mine , and no government can force us to go against our faith .
you people ( and by you people i mean everyone who thinks that all insurance policies must cover birth control ) have no respect for anyone but your own selfish wants .
that is not the __name1__ way .
you do know i chose my user name , do n't you ?
* · repeated ...
what does that have to do with the point that the government should not be forcing people to pay for other people 's contraception or force insurance companies to provide coverage for contraception ?
hey , pervert priests are no better or worse than the homosexuals .
that 's for sure .
no decent __name1__ @/@ __name2__ should support them .
hopefully both perversions are eradicated .
the government didnt say you directly pay for other peoples health care idiot .
the law says the health care providers can not change an extra co @-@ pay or co @-@ insurance for contraception .
its not free , its simply included in the cost of your premium .
seeing as how you already pay for other peoples services , why are you not complaining about every other service your health care provider provides for no additional cost ?
have you ever noticed how many kids __name1__ families have ?
i have heard that there is a fatwa for each __name1__ couple to have no less than __quant1__ children .
not sure if that is verifiable on the internet or not , though .
__value1__ of , dubya got more __name2__ money to __name1__ then __name3__ .
as for the __name1__ thing , so ?
its up to the church members weather or not they control there reproduction .
thay just dont fly . they are doing just fine in the membership department .
they would n't last in __name1__ , would they ?
there are 10 s of millions of __name1__ in __name2__ ...
when you go to a grocery store do you pay for other people 's food ?
when you go to __name1__ do you pay for other people 's computers ?
the sky is not orange .
again ,
what does that have to do with the point that the government should not be forcing people to pay for other people 's contraception or force insurance companies to provide coverage for contraception .
i do n't have to have insurance , its still a choice .
how an insurance company uses the money from the premiums to pay for other people 's health care is their business .
if they want to charge extra for contraception coverage that is also also their business not the government 's you arrogant prick .
you have no idea what this conversation is even about .
point to where the government says you will pay for other peoples contraception ?
the argument stems from a portion of the law that states all insurance plans must provide contraception as a services .
and that service will be provided for no extra charge .
meaning no extra copay or coinsurance .
do you have any idea how insurance actually works already ?
get an education dumbass .
do you have any idea that i am making a philosophical point ?
apparently not .
did you fail to understand my other philosophical point that the government should not be forcing insurance companies to provide services ?
apparently so .
how insurance works ?
education ?
really ?
get over your superiority complex dickhead
if you dont understand a simple premise like how insurance works obviously cant understand the rest of the argument .
so what you are really advocating is that insurance companies and health care providers not be regulated to have uniform standards ?
hmmm like all those ethical insurance companies who used to drop people when they got sick , or refused to provide them certain services they thought were too expensive , or refused to provide coverage to people with pre @-@ existing conditions .
hmmm sounds like a wonderfully perfect system .
pretty soon they wont have any regulations , and then they wont have to provide services to anyone who cant pay full price for the services .
so no one will have access to coverage .
again ,
wait __quant1__ minute .
are n't you the guy that insists that premiums go directly to pay for other people 's services ?
how can you argue that and , at the same time , argue that people are n't actually paying for other people 's services ?
again ,
he has trouble with complex chains of thought .
first off , the fact that health care costs so much and that so many people have to have insurance , ( which was originally created to be only for catastrophic situations ) just to walk into a doctor 's office is because the government 's overinvolvement in health care .
but that 's for a whole other discussion
government has restricted market forces from weeding out insurance companies who act out as you stated by preventing people from purchasing insurance across state lines .
this created an artificial monopoly where costs go up and coverage grows poorer .
open up access and competition increases .
increased competition means lower cost and better coverage for everyone .
should people have recourse if the insurance company screws the person over by not providing an agreed upon paid for service ?
yes !
in a free market these companies will go out of business real fast .
should the government mandate what services an insurance company provides ?
no.
government is not the solution , its the problem .
but that 's just my opinion as is yours that the government is the solution .
ok , we disagree .
i think when the free market fails to provide an adequate service such a basic health care at an affordable price government intervention can force change .
since the majority of people on this thread have basically decided that access to affordable health care is not a basic right and people do not deserve it , this rules out universal health ( unlike most of the rest of the industrialized world ) .
this being said , government regulation of this can provide a framework to make it accessible by more people than it currently it .
government is not always the solution , but neither is the free market .
just use the financial markets betwen __year1__ and __year2__ as an example of this .
if the insurance industry operated in a regulated free market there would be little or any threat of the horrors of dropped coverage , etc because the market would weed out bad actors .
not only that , prices would fall as insurance companies would lose their protected markets .
people would have more choice .
they could shop for the kind of coverage they wish to buy .
and if you or anyone else thinks __name1__ 's mandate that pre existing conditions must be covered is going to work , your nuts .
private insurers will simply stop writing health coverage and will of course drop existing insureds when their policies expire .
of course this is the goal of __name1__ .
to create a system where the only insurer available if the federal government .
__name1__ gets his wish for socialized medicine .
and we get shitty rationed care by doctors who are from __value1__ world countries , can barely speak __name1__ and are more likely to screw up .
they did operate in a free market between __year1__ and __year2__ .
how did the free market work out during that time ?
if they operated in a free market why were they required to cover so many different things under penalty of law ?
i do n't know what __name1__ thinks about it and will not lie and tell you i do know .
i think that birth control should remain legal as even if it is wrong , · the person has the right to chose to do it any way .
i am not for it or against , i am not a woman though .
i do believe that abortion is a sin as i see it as murder , which is why i am lead to believe that birth control should not be thought of as wrong as it could save a person from committing a sin by having to have an abortion .
where if they had been taking birth control they never would have had to commit a sin .
everybody who has insurance pays for other people 's claims .
the purpose of insurance is to spread the risk around .
some people will never have a claim .
others will have many claims .
do you own a home ?
think about how much your homeowner 's insurance costs you .
i had a patient in his __quant2__ s a couple weeks ago who has owned a home for __quant1__ years .
he said he figured up that over his lifetime he has paid $ __quant1__ in premiums , but has never filed a claim .
i have n't figured up mine because i 've moved several times .
too much trouble .
but mine right now is pretty high .
i 've only filed __quant1__ claim and that was for a roof damaged by hail .
$ __quant1__ .
i 've paid in much more .
but the others who have lost everything have been covered because i have joined in and help , with my premiums , to spread the risk around .
that 's how all insurance works .
med mal , health , car , you name it .
the name of the game is spreading out the risk .
if you never have a claim , you pay for everyone else 's !
if i were an insurance company , i would pay for contraception .
it would mean fewer dependents to cover .
not true .
if you have insurance you are paying a __value1__ party to assume the risk for your claims .
most insurance companies use the money from premiums to pay claims , but that does not mean that the person paying the premium is actually paying the claim .
there are insurance pools set up where people do pay for other people 's claims , but they do that by sending payment directly to the person that needs the money , not to the doctor or hospital .
well , if you were a a private insurance company you should have the choice to offer contraception coverage or not .
not be required to do so or not by the government .
as far as premiums paying for other people 's claims , is it really relevant ?
i still have the choice to pay for insurance or not .
another issue is the federal government is not even authorized to provide health care .
if we want to do this the constitution must be amended ( not that the federal government even follows the constitution anyway ) however , if the people of the individual states want to have their state government run their health care that 's completely fine .
just do n't expect the people of the other states that do n't want it to pay for it .
the __name1__ , the 10 th __name2__ , and __name3__ would be a court battle that 's for sure .
as for your comment
you are trying to make people who do n't support government run health care appear to lack compassion .
we already have a qausi socialized system .
there is already enough regulation to allow for recourse for declining paid for coverage .
i am of the opinion that free market forces will allow for greater ingenuity in medicine and lower costs through competition .
artificial monopolies do n't work and they stagnate progress .
more government involvement will generate more problems .
we simply disagree on what the government 's role should be in health care .
in turn , what 's wrong with letting an individual state such as __name1__ have government run care while __name2__ does not ?
with the residents of __name1__ not having to pay for __name2__ yorkers ' health care .
my post is not advocating for a full government run system .
what i am simply pointing out that government regulation can provide an avenue for change .
which is what is happening here .
there are many good things in the health care law which everyone agrees are good .
things like making __value1__ % of premium dollars be used on patient care , not being able to drop patients when they get sick , the removal of lifetime caps , kids being able to stay on their parents insurance until __quant1__ , mammograms at no additional costs , the elimination of pre @-@ exisiting conditions .
without government intervention then none of this would have happened .
the free market is not always the best solution .
look at natural monopolies such as utilities providers .
they have government regulated monopolies because it makes more sense logisitically and financially to have one say electricity provider instead of __quant1__ in a given area .
look at what the free market did to the financial markets between __year1__ and __year2__ ?
the lack of regulation cause a huge financial collapse .
i have never said the government should run everything or is the perfect solution to every problem .
but .....
government intervention and regulation can provide a positive avenue for change when the free market is not willing to do so .
health care costs have increased 10 fold since __year1__ , and the average family is getting squeezed out of the insurance market .
all of this due to the free market .
how much longer should we wait to see if the free market corrects itself ?
__quant1__ more years ?
__quant1__ more ?
your notion of letting __name1__ have state run health care but no __name2__ opens a large amount of problems .
what if someone from __name2__ travels to nh and gets hurt , but __name1__ will not accept the __name2__ health insurance ?
so the patient has to be transported back to __name1__ at the possibility of dying .
if every state had their own standards of health care , each state would need to have an separate agreement with every other state to accept that states health insurance .
if a state is not willing to do so , then you create problems amongst the states .
you will have people who will not travel outside their state for fear of incurring costs associated with this .
you will also have __quant1__ different form of health care .
what if __name2__ had good health care , and __name1__ didnt have good health care , would you allow the residents of __name1__ to cross state lines and improve their health care ?
would __name1__ be allow to restrict this through law ?
would people being to flee states due to lack of access to health care ?
if you create __quant1__ single minimum standard that has met , you provide uniformity across the industry .
this does not stop providers from exceeding that standard , but it provides a framework with which to start .
is this such a terrible thing ?
" but what if "...
the dumbest question on planet __name1__ .
it 's always " but what if "...
first , your premise is an impossibility .
one 's insurance is good in __quant1__ state , it is good in all others .
that comes from " __name1__ ".... <a __value1__ search the __name2__ __value1__ site </a> .
you are blowing this out of proportion .
the what ifs are how things are proposed and passed or not .
what if __name2__ gets a nuke is part of the discussion in __name1__ right now .
should they ignore that what if ?
is that the dumbest question on __name1__ to ask ?
people in rural areas can have as many children as they want..
no , not " as many as they want ."
it is more complicated than that .
for one thing , what 's poor .
to the billionaire , the mere millionaire is very poor .
the poor in this country is beyond the wildest dreams wealthy of the poor in most of the world .
my step granddaughter is poor .
she lives below the poverty line .
or does she ?
she is a single mother with __quant2__ children from __quant2__ different anonymous men .
she lives in __name1__ housing , a nice __quant1__ bedroom __quant2__ bath apartment .
her utilities are all subsidized .
she had benefit provided telephone service and a benefit provided cell phone .
her childen eat all three meals __quant1__ day at school , but she still has a loaded __name1__ card .
in addition , there are food banks and food pantries where she does n't have to pay at all .
my step granddaughter does n't drive .
when she wants to go someplace she has generously been provided a transit card to take the bus .
if the bus does n't go where she wants to go she can call for a car .
there are a number of public benefit provided access cars .
it would be unfair to say she does n't work .
she provides child care to her friend 's __quant1__ children .
she gets a check every month for that .
her friend gets paid for providing child care to my step granddaughter 's children .
she gets her welfare check every month .
she has never had to buy her children __name1__ presents .
they get dozens from any number of holiday giveaway programs .
__quant1__ of her children have been diagnosed as having some form of __name1__ .
they get ssi .
all in all , her take home is in excess of $ __quant1__ __quant2__ month .
she can afford to get her hair and nails done regularly .
she can afford to pay for her medical marijuana which she needs for generalized stress .
getting this kind of medical care as a public benefit is something she is vitally interested in . she is n't rich , but she certainly is quite comfortable .
it was n't always like this .
she was going to join the __name1__ and get job training .
at one time she was considering culinary school and become a chef .
she had dreams at one time but all that was leached away because being poor was just so easy and so comfortable .
this sounds like someone who has learned how to game the system , and that is unfortunate .
i 'm sure there are a few people like that .
and there are people who are working poor taking some of these benefits to survive .
i do think that at least part of the problem is that the government makes it too easy to get benefits and does n't do anything to hold people to account .
what sounds devastating here is that there are __quant1__ kids involved who are going to think that this is all perfectly normal and okay .
i would have no problem with a work requirement for welfare .
and drug testing , which liberals scream bloody murder about if anyone suggests it .
i think he was talking about those on welfare that choose to sit on there asses on welfare and do not even bother to look for work .
not the poor who look for work and are just having a hard time finding it .
i 'll answer the question , those who choose to sit on their asses and not help themselves do not deserve the help of others .
those that at least try to find work and do better for themselves deserve our help to get them on their feet .
then he should have said that ......
but he did not ......
if you listen to his whole quote instead of just being a left wing prick here and __quant1__ 'm no __name1__ fan , __name1__ was explaining how the poor had a safety net built in and the rich should n't worry but he was really concerned in this day and age the the middle class was losing everything they had gained slowly over all these __quant1__ .
but hey you want to lie because that 's the drum beat over this or to remain ignorant of the truth .
odds are if you are a __name1__ you are just a blatant liar .
wasnt talking about what __name1__ said .....
was talking about what the rabbi said ..........
do n't think harry is liberal or a __name1__ , but whatever .
i think these quotes are getting all mixed up here ......
i was referring to what the rabbi was saying about the poor ....
bummer dude .
i wish them well .
i could tell you a similar story , with the biggest difference being intervention .
i have the children now , now they have a real chance .
the poor are the ones who fill our military .
the poor are the ones who die for their country
wtf are you blathering about ?
in frequent threads here the brain @-@ dead leftists moan about how the " idle rich " ( like there is such a thing ) do n't deserve their money .
but look at the other side .
the poor in this country enjoy a lifestyle envied by even middle class people in most of the world .
what have they done to deserve this ?
the idlest of the idle rich invest money and help other hard working people get ahead .
the poor simply absorb tax payer funding and have babies .
are you going to make a modest proposal on what to do with our poor ?
as it is with most wars in __quant1__ countries .
what percent of the wealthy are fighting for their country ?
so the left are poor people who have tons of babies in order to soak up other peoples money , but also abort anything they can because they are murders ?
hmmmmm ......
amusing ....
i thought the " poor " was president __name1__ 's brother living in a hut .
i think bam bam did send him an autographed picture which he has not sold on e bay yet .
his aunt a person of interest of i think in the __name1__ area .
i think she gets poverty relief locally and not from him .
for __quant1__ .
i can n't remember why her deportation to __name1__ was stalled .
and his other uncle that was just got a dui charge .
he 's on the dole too i beleive .
__name1__ 's a champ .
his vision instead of helping any members of his family ( it takes a village ) or to help anyone else is to have a __name2__ party at the wh when __name1__ and __name3__ could have fed thousands who need food and water .
what a champ ! !
and you go __name1__ .
those hungry in __name1__ tonight will really care that you can do push ups and jumping jacks .
wow ...
if there were some kind of prize for crazy deflection ....
you 'd get it .
what is the wealth ' cut off ' point for getting into the military ?
wow .
lots of neg reps and personal attacks .
and not one person has answered the question .
if the left is so stuck on taxing the shit out of rich people because they dont work then why are n't they hep on cutting benefits for poor people who dont work ?
contumacious had it right : they vote .
that 's it .
precisely .
none .
most go into the military to defend thier nation on behalf of thier countrymen ...
even to defend rw'er .
frankly i think rw is unmasking himself .
what have the poor done to deserve our support ?
do n't talk to me .
talk to your " __name1__ ".
the only problem with your point is that you have not yet learned to distinguish between charity and forced compliance .
learn to give voluntarily , from your heart rd .
now give me your wallet , with everything in it .
give me a big smile and a hug too .
idiot .
there are some people in between jobs .
that happens .
fwiw local churches and other benevolent orgs are far better equipped to deal with those situations than the gov't .
but that 's not what i 'm talking about .
i am talking about the perpetual non @-@ working , who continue to receive benefits as a right .
as to your rant , during most of __name1__ 's tenure the ue rate was about __value1__ % .
meanwhile there was lots of off shoring going on .
so off shoring does not cause job loss .
actually for every job exported __quant1__ more are created domestically .
in the __decade1__ s you doubtless did not have a cell phone ( few people did ) .
you ached for the time you could get __quant1__ cents __quant2__ minute for calling .
today your calls are largely free based on a flat rate and you can make them almost anywhere .
oh , so you are talking about the welfare queen that __name1__ talked about that did n't really exist .
are we going to talk about unicorns next ?
lepruchauns ?
the unemployment rate is n't that important .
a __value1__ % unemployment rate where everyone has mcjobs is n't an improvement .
__quant1__ would much rather have the __name1__ ue of __value1__ % where you could throw out a resume and get a better paying job in __quant1__ month that you barely qualified for than the __value2__ % ue of __name2__ where you could n't get a job you totally qualified for because you were competing against __quant2__ other guys who were just as qualifed .
offshoring replaced good paying manufacturing jobs with service mcjobs .
that was not an improvement , guy .
bloodletting is not a valid medical treatment , either .
we send out __quant1__ in wealth every year to other countries , that 's not a good thing .
i am talking about generations of unemployed and unemployable people .
do n't tell me they dont exist .
you ought to know better .
your comparison of the __name1__ years with the __name2__ years is a joke .
but i have effectively refuted your point : off shoring was going like crazy during hte __name1__ years and there was more manufacturing going on here and less unemployment .
i am sorry you cannot compete against guys more qualified than you .
night school maybe ?
clearly we need the poor to have money in their pockets so they can buy our goods and services .
and the rich use them to build their empires .
when did a poor person ever create a job ?
last time he had money in his pockets .
before __name1__ took office .
that 's when .
now that 's circular thinking .
you answered your own question in your __value1__ sentence .
the ' poor ' create jobs through their spending habits .
um , no they dont .
you should ask all the __name1__ who give __quant1__ to the poor in one form or another .
if the poor do not deserve such charity , then __name1__ is a religion with a very serious fundamental flaw ...
to the point , perhaps of being an enabler of sloth and irresponsibility .
there is no ' reward ' criteria implicit in charity pr charitable acts :
char·i·ty   /ˈtʃærɪti/ show spelled[char @-@ __value1__ @-@ tee ] show ipa · noun , plural -@ __value2__ .
1 . generous actions or donations to aid the poor , ill , or helpless : to devote one 's life to charity .
2 . something given to a person or persons in need ; alms : she asked for work , not charity .
3 . a charitable act or work .
4 . a charitable fund , foundation , or institution : he left his estate to a charity .
5 . benevolent feeling , especially toward those in need or in disfavor : she looked so poor that we fed her out of charity .

i sure wish that every mcdonalds employee had a the cash to remodel their kitchen .
and despite the fact that their way did n't work , won't work , is n't going to work , they will never admit it .
look at how bad things were in __year1__ and they basically voted for another __quant1__ years of __name1__ .
that 's how brainwashed they are .
thank __name1__ for the __value1__ %ers ' they seem to understand the system is rigged .
i think most of them are going to vote for __name1__ again .
the economy is getting better and __name1__ is against them .
but man are a lot of middle class and even poor __name1__ brainwashed .
i 've narrowed it down to __name1__ , gays and guns .
flat out ignorants .
racist , stubborness .
or they even might actually possess a gene that you and i do n't have .
greed , bitter , always think somoenes out to get theirs .
not realizing they benefit too when we are all in this together .
and i know a lot of very good people who are voting __name1__ .
they have been brainwashed by __name1__ and @/@ or rush .
but again , they must have the gene that makes them seseptable to it , because all i get from watching __name1__ is mad .
people have been brainwashed .
now they are set in their ways .
all we can do is hope they wake up or stop voting .
lol youve studied the talking points well grasshopper .
most are complete shit .
but youre a leftie .
its to be expected .
think about what you go along with :
free but not fair trade · pollution · __name1__ and __name2__ pay no taxes and you pay __value1__ % · __name3__ · deregulations to the banks , wallstreet , mortgage industry , · lied us into a war · hiring illegals .
remember jobs __name1__ won't do ?
i did n't .
lowering wages @/@ breaking unions .
why ?
do n't you like __quant1__ hour work weeks and sick days ?
why , because of __name1__ gays or guns ?
or have they convinced you we are __name1__ because we are pro union/labor ?
that 's the middle class buddy .
and where did __name1__ call for forced support thru government over voluntary charity from one 's own heart ? ?
for in this country you are free to be generous and nobody stops you ...
and if you are indeed a miserly and selfish person , you also have the freedom to be such ...
and nobody has the right , even the government , to force them to support others
he said love your neighbor and take care of the sick and poor .
that 's what our government is doing .
we are all in this together .
i dont know how to answer with so many assumptions and projections .
you dont have a clue to my views .
let me help you out , because you people seem to believe collecting that extra __quant1__ __quant2__ year will stop the trillion and half deficit .
that deserves mocking .

how dare you .
most of the poor have already contributed to the system and what they get they have earned .
there are some who are poor because of no fault of there own and because of corrupt government has mis managed there tax money .
__name1__ said take care of poor and if you were any kind of __name2__ you would not bitch about the little the poor do get .

the only thing that i have heard that the grinch support is a colony on the moon and amnesty for illega aliens .

how would you solve the debt problem ?

or lying us into the __name1__ and paying for it with borrowed money .
and why when they were in power did the __name1__ pass tax breaks for companies sending jobs overseas ?
is it because our government now works for the corporations instead of the people ?
__name1__ would suggest so .
the __name1__ are only cutting spending on things that help the poor and middle class .
drop in the bucket but making __name1__ a much worse place than it was before .
eliminating safety nets during a time when you caused a great recession ?
and the rich have never been richer ?
and you think they need more tax breaks ?
history repeats itself .
this happned in __year1__ and before the __name1__ .
and most __name1__ do n't realize they are brainwashed through __name2__ and rush and __name3__ .
the media has been taken over but they 've brainwashed you for __quant1__ years by telling you its the liberal media .
its only as liberal as they want it to be .
a lot of straw in that rant .
how would i solve the problem ?
too many to list really but we start with restructure of government .
that alone covers up to __quant1__ billion __quant2__ year in redundant services .
now as far as other cuts .
lets remeber our broke entitlement system , ss is broke .
__name1__ made it law to put this money into the general fund and that ss be made a budget item .
should i thank you or kick you ?
they broke ss . it was n't broken before they purposely broke it .
and now they want to end it or privatize it ?
how about put it back to what it was before .
did n't bush tap into ss to pay for the __name1__ tax cuts ?
end the __name1__ tax cuts and __value1__ order is to put all that money back into ss where they found it .
__name1__ tapped into it too .
lock box .
remember that discussion in __year1__ ?
lol .
can you put the kool @-@ aid down for a few minutes .
that became law in 69 .
__name1__ have sold spending the money and here you are defending .
here is fact you can not dispute .
if ss had been reformed and we were allowed to invest that __value1__ percent .
there would be money in that fund today .
you can not say that with government .
what frightens you about investing __value1__ percent of your money ?
its me .
i 'm back .

well , in that case ask your congresscritter to provide you <a href="http://articles.cnn.com/1997-09-24/politics/irs.hearing_1_irs-abuses-irs-agent-jennifer-long-irs-management?_s=pm:allpolitics"> transcripts of __value1__ __name3__ senate hearings </a> which amply demonstrated that __name1__ gestapo agency known as __name2__ irs is judge , jury and executioner .
in times of piece , when the number of soldiers enlisted is lower , the army will only take the best and the brightest .
during war , they go right after the poor .
they were so deperate during the __name1__ @/@ __name2__ war that they took ex cons and sometimes even convicts in exchange for early release .
since i was in during the war , please provide proof .
sillybozo is full of just as much shit now as he was when he cowered out of here embarrassed a year __quant1__ ago
there is no material difference to the poor person whether his handout came from a voluntary contribution or as you call it ' forced '.
it has the same effect on him , and thus if you believe __name1__ propaganda , it makes him lazy and dependent .
btw , since government social programs are democratically created , it is only a fraction of the people who pay for them who have any cause to call them ' forced '.
there is quite a difference in how it is obtained , which is the fucking point ...
you advocate control , others advocate freedom ....
nobody is owed the means for caring for themselves..
unless , that is , they are wards of the state
idiot ...
again ...
__name1__ never called for the forced confiscation from others
actually __name1__ ' admonishment was to pay your taxes .
but by your own measure , it 's forced confiscation that causes me to pay for the portion of defense spending that i do n't support .
__name1__ 's call to give was not tied to the confiscation by government ...
but nice try ...
it is forced confiscation in taxes to pay for national defense..
which is for every person @/@ citizen equally ...
not for the confiscation of some for the sole benefit of others ...
our government is not ' taking care of the sick and poor ', they are throwing money at the problem ...
money that is being taken for forced charity
this is not some hippie commune where ' everyone is in this together '..
this is a nation based on freedoms and the protection of those freedoms..
among which is the freedom to succeed that goes hand in hand with the freedom to fail
while i whole heartedly call for people to support charities for causes that speak to them personally ...
in no way should any charity or support be forced thru government and taxation ...
such things are exactly why we have the multi @-@ tendrilled leviathan , hungry for power , that we have now ...
which is crippling our country
charity is limited in what they can do for the poor .
they always have been .
in good times , they are flush with funds and do not have as many people to help .
in hard times , their funding dries up and they have more people asking for help .
the government is always there for those in need .
not just with food and shelter but with healthcare , educational support , jobs programs ......
things that charity does not provide
charity is limited by donation ....
you personally do n't like it if someone else does not give as much as you think is enough for others to equalize outcome
the government 's job is not to ensure your every personal need is taken care of ...
government 's job is to protect the freedoms of all citizens so that they can succeed or fail all on their own
idiot ...
sorry but we are not a darwinistic society
thank __name1__ we do n't allow people like yourself to make decisions
sorry ...
you 're now owed provisions to take care of yourself , simply because you exist..
that is , unless you are a ward of the state where you are indeed stripped of your freedoms ( prisoners , the mentally incompetent etc...
they are the ones who clean up your shit , make your burger , and make sure __name1__ has your favorite brand of __name2__ .
you are douche bag rabbi .
and they have been paid appropriately for their labors ...
if everyone on the fucking planet were not qualified to do the same exact thing , they could then probably demand more for their labor ...
if you do not improve yourself , what you can bring to the table in skills , etc , it is not up to society or government to make up for it
" and they have been paid appropriately for their labors..."
i think that proably our biggest problem is that that is very rarely true .
it would probably be at least as true to say that those who work the hardest are paid the least .
we are __name1__ no matter who is in charge .
if it 's the __name1__ , only those who hew the line on global warming , racism , poverty , etc etc will get official permission to continue .
at least with __name1__ people can succeed or fail on their own .
give a man a fish and you feed him for __quant1__ day .
teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime .
giving someone some old unwanted can of creamed corn rusting in the back of the pantry hardly competes with really giving someone a chance .
the " let them die " crowd does n't get it .
what cold , hard hearts and tiny minds they have .
would __name1__ be proud ?
i doubt it .
some people are down and out despite their best efforts .
those are the ones that we seek to help and i 've never heard anyone object to that , on either side .
liberals see victims everywhere and coddle anyone who might be willing to support them .
liberal politicians require as many dependents as possible to ensure their power and they are expert at creating government dependents .
the premise seems to be that any person is entitled to everything by virtue of the fact that they were born .
liberals expect nothing from their dependents other than blind obedience and a vote .
in exchange , the person will receive things for nothing .
i have a huge problem with the growing number of people who seek to scam the system and a government who is reticent to call them up on it .
they see increased applications for welfare as a success .
it means they have more people who are unlikely to bite the hand that feeds them .
we see illegal aliens getting disability checks , along with free housing , food , utilities and medical .
where is the incentive to work if politicians will support you just for the asking ?
i know there are needy who have no choice , but i also know there are people who have a choice and they have opted to take what they can even though they could do better for themselves if they were so inclined .
now that more jobs are gone forever , more have no choice but to turn to government .
i believe this is by design .
able bodied people have soaked the system for __quant1__ and they no longer have the desire to do for themselves .
i think this was the intent .
now , those who are hopelessy workshy have increased to the point where they can turn elections in their favor .
we were warned by our forefathers that once the majority of the populace realized that they could vote to have the wealth from others passed to them , it was the beginning of the end for the country .
you bet .
once the public has learned that they can draw from the public largesse then we are done .
we already have __value1__ % of the folks in this country who pay no fed taxes .
what happens when that number reaches __value1__ % , __value2__ % or __value3__ % ?
the takes will outnumber those providing .
greece anyone ? ?
if you and every other human on __name1__ could perform the task ...
you 're not going to be paid as much as you would if you had a specialized skill ...
sorry..
that 's the way it is and why fry cooks do n't get experienced welder pay
then would you care to explain why so many people with degrees and other specialized skills are fry cooks and dishwashers ?
if noone needs a welder the special skill won't make you anything .
also there are many jobs that require a lot of trining and @/@ or education , are very important to our society , and still do n't pay much .
which jobs are important , competitive , and do n't pay much ?
if you say math @/@ science teachers , the reason is because of union rules , which forbid paying some area teachers more than others .
almost every instance of extended shortage is the result of gov't policies .
ask him what percent of hisself fought for our country .
those of you who call yourselves __name1__ need not ask this question if you are a true follower of __name2__ .
there have been times in the past , perhaps to this day , when some military families qualified for food stamps , and perhaps other government ' handouts '.
during __name1__ 's terms , i frequently had to help my sailors with families apply for food stamps .
anyone e @-@ 5 or below with spouse and __value1__ kids minimum qualified .
i remember it shocking me .
they just do n't understand or accept that the demand for certain skills changes..
and like in all other aspects of life , you have to adapt and overcome ...
not just sit there crying and waiting for someone to hand you what you need..
in ancient times..
these were the ones pouting that their old way of making spears was not working in the newer land with different animals..
and while sitting in the field pouting , the smilodon pounced and had them for lunch
really ?
how so ?
anyone who is a true follower of __name1__ knows you give personally and from your own heart ...
not having it raped from you whether you have the calling to give it or not
and in a country based on freedom ...
you have the freedom to be a miserly prick too , even if ones like you do n't like it and want to be generous with someone else 's money
paying taxes is not rape
“ if this is going to be a __name2__ nation that does n’t help the poor , either we have to pretend that __name1__ is just as selfish as we are or we ’ve got to acknowledge that he commanded us to love the poor and serve the needy without condition .
and then admit that we just do n’t want to do it .”
– __name1__
an interesting thought he makes .
involuntary charity forced by government to take care of someone else 's personal needs is tantamount to rape , or theft , or whatever other little description work that can be used to show violation
no go play in traffic , you habitual liar
personally..
i do n't care about the thoughts of a comedian
and that was certainly a motivator for me to work my way up the career ladder of my profession .
as __quant1__ who finished the __name1__ at __quant2__ , i knew i would not really feel like thumping up and down the halls of a hospital for very many years .
but , believe it or not , there are people who really like what they do even though you consider it to be menial .
i know nurses who work the bedside , who have always worked the bedside , and will have to be carried off the job feet __value1__ if they ever leave the beside .
people who work at hard labor are fit and healthy and live fairly long lives .
when we were young , before my husband got an easier job , he did manual labor .
he was tan and muscular and looked like a __name1__ god .
i often wonder if he might have lived longer had he stayed with a more physically demanding job .
i often wonder that about myself , although my arthritis usually answers the question for me .
the big problem with people who have your attitude is that you demean honest forms of work .
if they have made peace with their pay , then there is no reason you should not be at peace with their pay as well .
when i was in the hospital about to die back in __month1__ , did i want a psych np , a clone of myself ?
oh hell no !
i wanted a good staff level nurse who knew how to take care of me because i could n't take care of myself .
and i wanted a good nursing assistant who would help me wash my hair , bathe , and feel like a human being again .
they were there .
and ya know what , almost to the person the cnas were in nursing school and the nurses were in np school .
for i was hospitalized at __name1__ where employees can get their education for free if they contract to work there for a while .
" the big problem with people who have your attitude is that you demean honest forms of work . "
on the contrary my purpose in responding to this thread has been to point out that there is nothing shameful in having priorities other than making the maximum possible amount money and that simply having money does not mean you are more intelligent or industrious than anyone else .
by the same token not having a great deal of money does n't mean someone expects , wants or needs some kind of handout .
and it most certainly does not follow that a lack money indicates a lazy welfare cheat and @/@ or drug dealer .
" i know nurses who work the bedside , who have always worked the bedside , and will have to be carried off the job feet __value1__ if they ever leave the beside ."
that would be me for 40+ years ( except for the feet __value1__ part ) .
and i could only dream of the pay and benifits a union welder gets .
i have also worked at __name1__ .
the average nurse there impressed me as being more interested in finding a doctor to marry than in their patients .
all thsoe things are fine and dandy , but not what the thread is about .
if someone isnt interested in making the max amt of money he can , fine .
i 'm not .
i have other priorities .
but i 'm not sitting around expecting the state to pay my rent and food bill either .
but lots of people are .
and they are the problem , simply because they cause a demand on other people 's resources .
__name1__ ( not vanderbuilt--i doubt you worked there ) is a teaching hospital .
so nursing care is n't wonderful .
has anyone else noticed the recent concerted effort by the __name1__ to paint being poor in __name2__ as desirable and good ?
just another indicator of how out of touch the party is .
negged for being an asshole .
you fuck wads need to separate the poor from people on welfare .
the poor are not thriving in an __name1__ party land .
we work and get by . we aint chillin all day tippin back __quant1__ 's .
my sore legs and tired back would like you to go fuck yourself .
hey now , i work and knock back __quant1__ 's when i clock out .
it 's amazing the people who push this crap think if you are n't paying taxes to the gov't then no charitable acts wil ever take place .
the truth is that the govt is the least efficient method of distributing anything that might actually help people .
but in general gov't programs increase poverty and dependence .
which is probably the idea .
the truth is that charities are the least efficient .
on top of exorbitant salaries of some charity ceos , they have high overhead and are feast or famine depending on contributions
public charities are a nice stopgap but they are incapable of handling the volume that the government can .
no country on __name1__ relies on public charities to handle all their public welfare
they are actually the most efficient , far more than the gov't , in part because they are there , while the gov't is in __name1__ .
the more bureaucrats run charities , the mroe people who need them .
the more private sources run charities , the less people need them .
moral in there somewhere .
may i see the sources for this claim , please ?
sure , go right ahead .
so you think an active duty member of the military whose family qualifies for food stamps should get a parttime job ( is that even legal ?
!) so that he makes enough to not be qualified for food stamps ?
you see , this is why i 'm right when i say conservatism is dead .
the only active duty personnel i ever saw in __quant1__ yrs that needed food stamps were the ones that enlisted with a family all ready or got married too young and started a family .
if a man or woman enlists at __quant1__ and waits 3 or 4 years until they are at least e @-@ 4 or e @-@ 5 when they qualify for military housing , they can raise a family with no problem on military pay .
that depends , an e @-@ 4 or an e @-@ 5 with a spouse and kids who lives on a base in __name1__ or __name2__ would probably qualify for food stamps because the cost of living is so outragreously high in those places , __day1__ was stationed at __name3__ in __name4__ country and everyone who was n't an e @-@ 7 or above was struggling like hell to make ends meet , the cash checking places were always packed with enlisted folks on the · __day1__ st and __day2__ th when we got paid .
if they live in on base housing , thier rent is covered .
unfoutantely , most base have limited housing and they go to married e @-@ 4 's and above .
more empty nothings ....

good self @-@ description , seymour .
sometimes people are in difficult situations , especially financially , however those with enough brains are not satisfied with their position so they move on , and in some situations become the __value1__ % or comfortable financially .
that 's what i 'd expected .
you pro - life pricks could ( almost ) give -@ a @-@ fuck about anyone .....

you sadistic , fuckin ' assholes !!!!
reminds me of a __name1__ ' routine where he basically talks about all the pro @-@ life people and how they demand this and that , and how a baby deserves to be born .
and then he says " and what does a pro @-@ life person say when you go up to them with the off @-@ spring of a crack @-@ whore who has terminal __name1__ ? "
" not our problem ! "
bingo !!!

private charities are much more inefficient than government .
most of their overhead is dedicated just to the act of raising money .
some charities spend as much as __value1__ % just in fundraising expenses
what 's the overhead for govt ?
i 'll bet it is much higher than the average ( not some horror story ) for charities .
the issue is not which kind of ' charity ' is most efficient , government or private .
the issue is that government charity creates a class of poor who are never anything but poor , make their beds __quant1__ in their own misery , cannot see the opportunities that are out there for them in this great country , and have given up their freedom for a type of miserable security that no one would choose without having it foisted upon them .
any government program or function has high overhead .
what do private charities do to wean people out of poverty ?
government welfare agencies offer educational support and jobs programs to provide a way out of poverty .
millions of __name1__ have taken advantage of these programs
omg ! !!
you are an absolute idiot ! !!
fact is , government overhead is much lower .
government executives make significantly less than the heads of charities .
charities have to spend a great deal of their time and effort on just raising money .....
forget about dispersing it .
government does not have that problem
" but lots of people are .
and they are the problem , simply because they cause a demand on other people 's resources ."
and that is also fine and dandy but that gives you no right to slander those who make no such demands .
if you would n't demand the taxpayer subsidize your gasoline in every post i might take you seriously .
you 've lost it .
i 've never demanded the tax payer subsidize my gasoline in any post .
do you have some explaination or do you commonly just spout whatever wild @-@ assed lie pops into your head ?
hardly ...
the red tape and crap thru the multi @-@ levels of government waste more money ...
you find numerous numerous charities out there where a vast majority , if not all proceeds going to the cause and not lining pockets
you get to research and choose your charities ....
while government adds more and more levels , more and more red tape , at more and more expense , without choice
we need fewer people on welfare , not more .
well no shit .
why do n't you propose just how it is that these welfare recipients are going to get that working poor job .
where are the repubcon " job creators ".
i mean , what could be better than employing a person with no skills and no education ?
you only have to pay them minimum wage .
someoen with no skills is n't worth minimum wage .
that 's why they 're unemployed .
reduce min wage and we can see some job growth .
and as people develop skills from their starter job they will earn more .
now we can see why you are such a rocket scientist
just what we need to help people escape poverty ....
slashing wages and benefits
so rabbi ...
according to your economic model .
if you are paying some guy minimum wage to sweep your floors , if you slash minimum wage you will now hire __quant1__ guys to sweep your floors
again .
when you get that minimum wage job with no benes , how long are they going to keep it ?
when you can n't pay for child care , how long are you going to work .
if you get sick and fired for missing work , oh well .
from the discussions i read on here , people would think it is easy to be poor .
they have big screens , but they bought them from a person that sells stolen goods .
they have a cell phone .
whoop t do .
how they gonna conduct their " bidness " without a cell phone ?
so they have medical issues .
that is what __value1__ calls are for .
and hospital emergency rooms .
much easier to be rich .
as long as you do n't want to tax them more .
then it is really really hard to defend your money .
but it is much easier if you have poor people to blame for not paying taxes .
then rich people can say that if poor people do n't pay income taxes then why should they pay even more income taxes .
does n't make any difference if the fact poor people pay no income tax is the result of the tax writing policies put in place by the repubcons so the stupid __name2__ would go along with the tax package that lowered the tax rates on the wealthy .
it is the poor persons fault .
poor people have really sucky lobbyists .
aww poor people .
it 's just really tough .
much easier to sit back and get dat gummint check .
let 's make it easy for everyone .
hey , let 's just send everyone a gummint check every month and no __quant1__ will have child care worries or problems paying rent .
you really have to wonder why he has n't left in shame .
i hope you mean nutwinger .
i guess it never occurred to him that if you expect people to work their way up you need to have somewhere they can start .
with a high min wage it cuts out lots of starting jobs , like theater ushers and the like , that teenagers typically got back in the __decade1__ s , __decade2__ s etc. now there is hardly any way a teenager can get job experience so they are more employable .
we raised the min wage and teenaged unemployment went through the roof .
and the __name1__ want it even higher .
quote : originally posted by 9 thiddoc · quote : originally posted by the rabbi · quote : originally posted by 9 thiddoc · " but lots of people are .
they provide an example of what happens when you fuck up your life .
many restaurant workers do not make minimum wage .
they depend on tips .
if they need a theater usher they will hire one at minimum wage .
fact is , they do n't need them .
jobs are determined by the work that needs to be accomplished .
cutting the minimum wage does not mean you have more work
raising the minimum wage is why we no longer have theater ushers , or gas station attendants .
we got self serve gas stations when the minimum wage made it cost effective .
we used to have a lot of entry level jobs for kids that the minimum wage got rid of .
remember the paper boy ?
we still have " paper boys " they drive cars though .
ag migrant workers are exempt from the minimum wage law .
" what have the poor done to deserve our support ? "
they built and maintain this nation .
do rich people do anything besides go to " meetings "?
and how many of those types do you think there are ?
let 's see ...
once again ...
we have a real unemployment number( including those that gave up ) of __value1__ @-@ __value2__ % .
so at the high end ...
that 's __quant1__ people ....
let 's break that down , shall we ?
how many are disabled ?
how many are just temporarily receiving benefits ?
how many are really working the system ?
i dont know .
and it doesnt matter .
what matters is we have a very large number of people who think a gov't check is a reasonable alternative to finding work .
and our system has fostered that belief .
we need to reform the system ( not just welfare ) to make it possible fr people to enter the workforce and stay there and advance .
one needs that capacity to begin with .
sociopathic personalities do n't .
i happen to agree with rabbi
welfare needs to provide __quant1__ things .
a safety net and a path out .
while conservatives rant about how the safety net allows the poor to live in the lap of luxury with flat screen tvs , microwave ovens and cell phones , most poor live in bad neighborhoods with bad schools and few job prospects
as to a path out ....
that 's where it gets tricky .
we need to provide good schools , jobs related training , low cost childcare and jobs programs that not only provide a foot in the door but some type of career path
most importantly , the poor need to do more to help themselves .
low marriage rates , fractured family structures , teenaged pregnancy all help to ensure they do not escape poverty
and poverty programs all support and reward exactly those things you correctly identify as keeping people in poverty .
maybe htis is a breakthrough .
the other day ( __month1__ __day1__ ) senator __name1__ wrote a piece in the wapo detailing why she 's quiting .
sounds a lot like what __name1__ said a couple of years ago .
putting aside whatever you might think of either person , the issue of the __name1__ 's total inability to cooperate with each other is badly damaging the country .
quite frankly , i do n't know if it 'll make much difference who wins the wh or who wins the __name1__ majority this __month1__ .
i do n't see either party winning __quant1__ seats , so it 's going to come down to bipartisanship if anything significant is to be done .
and we got some significant things that need doing .
i think __name1__ 's partisan politics and rhetoric make him unable or maybe even unwilling to actually cooperate and compromise .
if he 's elected , i do n't see him accepting anything less than his way on everything important .
the same for __name1__ , if a repub wins the wh but the __name3__ keep their majority in the __name2__ .
maybe i 'm wrong , maybe that 's unfair , but these guys appear to be soley interested in party politics above what 's really best for the country .
and i can n't say the __name1__ would be any different if they get in . even if they did win the wh and both __name4__ of __name5__ , they 're not going to have a filibuster proof __name2__ , and that means working together with the __name3__ .
in my view , the __name2__ had their shot and blew it ; it 's time to give the repubs their chance , with the understanding that we need to see some action on the things that matter most .
snippet :
__quant1__ difficulty in making the __name1__ work the way it was intended is that __name2__ ’s electorate is increasingly divided into red and blue states , with lawmakers representing just __quant2__ color or the other .
before the __year1__ election , __quant1__ senators came from states that voted for a presidential nominee of the opposing party .
that number has dropped to just __quant1__ senators in __year1__ .
the result is that there is no practical incentive for __value1__ percent of the senators to work across party lines .
the great challenge is to create a system that gives our elected officials reasons to look past their differences and find common ground if their initial party positions fail to garner sufficient support .
in a politically diverse nation , only by finding that common ground can we achieve results for the common good .
that is not happening today and , frankly , i do not see it happening in the near future .
__name1__ olympia snowe : why irsquom __name2__ the senate __name3__ washington post </a>
something significant being done is exactly what many are opposed to , and wish to maintain the stalemate .
the same for __name1__ if a repub wins the wh but the __name3__ keep their majority in the __name2__ .
maybe i 'm wrong , maybe that 's unfair , but these guys are soley interested in party politics above what 's really best for the country .
__name1__ and __name2__ have equally engaged in partisan politics and rhetoric making both unwilling to actually cooperate and compromise ; indeed , mcconnell made clear the __name3__ minority ’s __quant1__ goal was to ‘ get rid of __name4__ .’ to blame only __name5__ and __name6__ for ‘ playing politics ’ is blind and partisan on your part .
and i can n't say the __name1__ would be any different if they get it .
even if they did win the wh and both __name3__ of __name4__ , they 're not going to have a filibuster proof __name1__ , and that means working together with the __name2__ .
give the __name1__ a chance to do what , exactly ?
they had their chance between __year1__ and __year2__ , resulting in __quant1__ failed , illegal wars , a deficit , and bigger government .
some might go so far as to say __name1__ policies resulted in the __month1__ __year1__ recession ; i won’t make that claim but it ’s certainly damning evidence .
if this was supposed to be a ‘ plague on both houses ’ thread , it ’s a major fail .
compromise is a dirty word to most of the right who actually destroy their own for engaging in such treason to the ideology and you are going to complain that __name1__ refuse to cooperate ?
knuckle under to threats and cave @-@ in to pressure you mean ?
__name2__ have compromised on plenty , they are just not going to assist __name2__ in their mission to dump the poor and the old any further , __name2__ are going to have to finish that one by themselves .
well , you can n't pass a health care bill , in the middle of the night , against the majority of the nation , with little or no input of the other side and expect lines not to be draw @-@ en .
horseshit .
on so many levels .
one , the bill was " against the majority of the nation " only when you combine those who were against any comprehensive health care reform with those who thought the bill was n't nearly liberal enough .
two , the only reason there was little or no input from the other side is because the other side refused to offer any beyond " kill the bill ."
three , in spite of the fact that __name2__ passed the bill by themselves , it is still from start to finish a __name1__ bill , lacking every feature that progressives might have preferred ( e.g . a public option ) , and the only reason republicans opposed it is because they would politically committed to oppose anything and everything .
the majority is the majority no matter what .
even under president __name1__ when the majority was against that health care bill , it was respected and not passed .
because the majority did not want it .
it was n't forced like this one was .
you did n't watch the committee meetings did you ?
the majority of __name1__ killed almost every single bill brought up by __name2__ .
so their bills did not even get to the floor for a vote at all .
this health care bill is a __name1__ bill all the way , through and through .
they own it , it is their baby .
hillarycare was just put on the back @-@ burner ...
for another day ...
but what we have is worse ...
what i 'm saying is that there was no majority .
a minority of the people wanted a more progressive approach to health @-@ care reform .
a minority liked the __name1__ as written .
a minority were philosophically opposed to any significant government involvement .
the only way you get a majority is to improperly and deceptively combine the __value1__ group with the __value2__ .
that is , not to put it too strongly , bullshit .
the majority of __name1__ killed almost every single bill brought up by __name2__
i watched some of them , and read about the __name1__ proposed amendments afterwards .
the __name1__ knew their amendments would be killed , and intended that they be killed .
those amendments existed only to slow the process down .
none of them were serious attempts to improve the bill .
funny how even a relatively sane and rational __name1__ like wiseacre sees obama as a hard @-@ line , inflexible partisan , while to us on the left he comes across as a totally unsatisfactory limp noodle without a vertebra to his name .
clearly , __name1__ 's reasoning does n't apply to the president ( regardless of party ) since he is elected by all of the states .
what would you call a president who deliberately called conservatives ' the enemy '?
there is no clearer ' partisan ' than your messiah .
i do n't have a " messiah , " and if i did he certainly would n't be __name1__ , and i do n't recall him calling conservatives " the enemy , " and would appreciate a link or citation of him doing so .
in context , please .
no ...
he called the ' private sector ' businesses " the enemy ".
he has stayed true to his writings .
anything else you want to deflect ?
a different claim , but again : link or cite , please .
in context .

shame upon you ...
he wrote it .
here 's an interesting take on how turnout is shaping up in this primary season , by demographic , and what that implies for the __name1__ this year .
__value1__ electoral wasteland - nytimes.com </a>
in barely __quant1__ century ’s time , the population of the __name1__ has more than tripled , to 313 million .
we are a clattering , opinionated cluster of nearly all the world ’s races and religions , and many of its languages , under __quant1__ flag .
you would not know any of this looking at who is voting in one of the strangest presidential primary campaigns in history .
there is no other way to put this without resorting to demographic bluntness : the small fraction of __name1__ who are trying to pick the __name2__ nominee are old , white , uniformly __name3__ and unrepresentative of the nation at large .
none of that is a surprise .
but when you look at the numbers , it ’s stunning how little this __name1__ primary electorate resembles the rest of the __name2__ .
they are much closer to the population of __year1__ than of __year2__ ....
so far , __quant1__ voters have participated in the __name1__ races , less than the population of __name2__ .
this means that __value1__ percent of all registered voters in those states have not participated in what is , from a horse @-@ race perspective , a very tight contest .
yes , we know __name1__ do n’t like their choices ; it ’s a meh primary .
but still , in some states , this election could be happening in a ghost town .
less than __value1__ percent of registered voters turned out for __name1__ ’s caucus .
in __name1__ , where __name2__ turnout was down __value2__ percent from __year1__ , only __value1__ percent of total registered voters participated ....
__name1__ is the major outlier this year , the only state to show a big increase in turnout , up __value1__ percent from __year1__ .
but when you look at who voted , you see a very specific niche .
in the __name2__ , __value1__ percent of primary voters were white , __value2__ percent were age __quant1__ or older and nearly two @-@ thirds were evangelical __name1__ , according to exit polls .
from this picture , you may think __name1__ is an all @-@ white , aging state , full of fervent churchgoers .
but the census says the state is only __value1__ percent white , with a median age of __quant1__ .
exit polls from __year1__ put the evangelical vote at __value1__ percent of total ....
outside of __name1__ , this contest has been nearly an all @-@ white affair .
__name2__ is __value1__ percent __name1__ by population ; in the primary , only __value2__ percent were __name1__ .
caucus voters in __name1__ were __value1__ percent white .
again , these numbers represent a small echo chamber .
whites are __value1__ percent of the total population of the __name1__ ; in 1900 , they were __value2__ percent — still more diverse than republican primary voters today .
the takeaway point of this poorly attended , unrepresentative __name1__ primary contest is not to focus entirely on who is voting but on why the candidates are taking such fringe positions .
one explains the other .
thus , __name1__ poll of this week found that all voters , by a 66 to 26 ratio , support the federal requirement that private health care plans cover the full cost of birth control for female patients .
among women , support is 72 @-@ 20 .
and with __name1__ , it ’s 67 @-@ 25 .
yes , __name1__ are slightly more liberal than the population at large .
other polls show a huge majority of __name1__ want to raise taxes on the rich , favor the planned withdrawal from __name2__ and believe the __name3__ is warming because of human action .
yet the __name2__ front @-@ runner of the moment , __name1__ , is with the minority on each of these issues , and __name3__ is a near match .
so , given how out of sync these __quant1__ candidate are with the rest of the country , how could they be the front @-@ runners ?
it ’s simple : look at who is voting , a nation unto itself .
now i predict that the usual suspects , if they reply at all , will dismiss this as the views of a liberal columnist and so avoid dealing with the hard facts he presents .
as long as that head @-@ in @-@ the @-@ sand tendency persists , so will the problem .
wonderful : the toddster and the joeb arguing with each other .
a crazy comedy duo , those __quant1__
i can still smack you around if you 'd like .
you end up face down butt in the air as you always do .
but ...
go ahead if you need the attention , and i will call the t in for you .
it goes back to romney( care ) when __name1__ eventually ends his " flavor of the week " stint .
it ’s always been __name1__ .
and the problem with __name1__ is n’t that he ’s not ‘ conservative enough , ’ whatever that means .
the problem with __name1__ is he ’s weak , indecisive , and inconsistent .
had __name1__ been a consistent liberal over the years – his true designation – conservatives might not agree with him but they ’d have no choice but to respect him .
currently the right affords him neither support nor respect .
true on both counts .
still projecting i see .
if there is an __name1__ that does not indirectly employ a boat load of illegal immigrants here and __name2__ over there then let me be the __quant1__ to shake his hand .
really has nothing to do with what i said , but let 's look at that .
the people who control commerce have made the decision that the middle class made too much money back in the __decade1__ 's and they did n't have enough to buy all the polo ponies they wanted .
so they insisted on free trade with countries like __name1__ that chop up their own citizens for transplant organs .
and they insisted on " right to work " laws that busted up the unions .
and they insisted on lax immigration laws .
now , i agree , it would be nice if we all employed a bit of common sense and spent the few extra pennies to only buy what is made here .
it would be better if we refocused our illegal immigration efforts off the poor immigrants and onto the rich assholes who pay them under the table so they won't have to pay an __name1__ a fair wage .
and this is where " conservatives " like you and __name1__ have really messed it up .
in your effort to get rid of the middle class and unions , you 've made people more dependent on government , and therefore , more likely to vote for more of it .
anyone that has a nickel in their pocket has a part in controlling commerce .
everyone should have a right to work .
forcing folk to join a union to be able to work is as unamerican as it gets .
why should __quant3__ have to pay a union boss that works __quant1__ hours __quant2__ month 100k __quant3__ year to be able to work ?
you should n't - if you would have the same wages and benefits without the union .
unions are for those that do not have the skills and education to be able to negotiate their own wages in a free market .
underachievingt lazy __name1__ need unions .
hard working skilled professionals never need a union .
they can negotiate their own contract without having to carry the fat , lazy , uneducated , low skilled and dependent union worker .
unions are for those that have no other skill other than a __value1__ th grade educated worker has with a hammer in their hand .
tell that to the construction crafts and trades skilled labor folks .
we all knew that santorums biggest set back was the fact that he does n't come off as presidential , but he does have __quant1__ vital thing going for him , , he is very likable and the __name1__ and __name2__ will settle for him much more than __name3__ .
then again , __name1__ was never presidential , if anything , a stuttering senator with no personality and needed cue cards just to speak to an audience .
lol .
you must also think leprosy and smallpox are very likable .
no , we do n't know that .
people like get involved and i are still fighting to make it happen .
what illegal immigration has done to the workforce is criminal , and needs to be addressed .
as long as there are people willing to stand up for what is right , there is a chance that we can get something done .
why not make them legal ?
give them migrant work visas .
allow them to work , pay taxes , stop hiding .
allow them to go home when they want and come back to work .
allow them to apply for citizenship and get credit for the time they have been here
ok ....
are they also going to have to pay a sum of cash for the back taxes they did not pay ? ....
how would you determine what they owe ?
there 's no records of stolen social security numbers ...
no
because given the chance they would have gladly accepted a fair wage and paid a tax on it
if anything , those who employed them should have to pay back taxes
workers who worked under a fake ssn paid taxes and received no credit
the problem with most of you liberals is that you never know what the fuck you 're talking about .
i 've been saying throughout this thread that the criminal employers need to be prosecuted .
it 's __name1__ and __name2__ before him that won't follow the damned law .
i 've been in the construction trades most of my adult life and i 'd be happy to start working those jobs again .
my only problem is that i 'm an __name1__ who is expected to pay his bills and his taxes , which is impossible to do on the current wages paid for those construction jobs .
you see , i 've got responsibilities to my family like college for my kid , insurance for my car , payments to the doctor , etc. , etc....
i can n't live __quant1__ people in a __quant2__ bedroom house , i can n't use the er as a clinic , i can n't give a false or stolen __name1__ and avoid paying taxes .
and just for the record moron , it 's got nothing to do with skin color .
that racist canard is old , tired and wrong .
no , of course it is n't .
i always am amazed how you think these illegals are all lving large on your dime .
i know a lot of people in the trades , and they are doing fine .
of course , no one is building houses right now because we already have more than the market can sell , but blame the illegals for your woes ...
i 'm always kind of amused that you guys want to fire all the government workers because they are making too much money , but you have a fit when someone undercuts your salary .
bullshit !
they claimed ' exempt ' and paid nothing !
why worry about it , when the wages get reported to the __name1__ they go after the real owner of that ss __name2__ !
the __name1__ want cheap labor for business .
the __name1__ want total inclusion for all people .
neither party wants to change anything .
but seriously .
study globalization .
the point is to replace expensive __name1__ labor with cheap __name2__ labor or abominably cheap __value1__ rd world labor .
research the relationship of one __name2__ 's largest businesses , __name1__ , with __name3__ .
__name1__ bypassed __name2__ 's more expensive labor markets for profits .
they care about profits over patriotism .
this is what __name1__ do n't understand about the free market : capital does n't care about __name2__ labor .
capital does n't care about borders , language , culture ; rather , it cares about maximizing profit .
if it has to sell __name1__ labor down river , it will .
the story of the loss of __name1__ jobs is the story of capital 's thirst for cheap labor .
the story of open borders is partly the story of how capital requires open borders in order to get the cheapest labor wherever and however it can find it .
the average __name1__ voter does n't get it .
when your party was taken over by market fundamentalism , it became an accomplice of open borders and __name1__ job loss , both of which are contrary to the fake brand of " patriotism ", which is merely a narcotic fed to idiots .
__name1__ voters are urged to read __quant1__ great conservative authors .
1 . __name1__ 's " __name2__ ".
this is about the contradiction between the market 's desire for open borders and the __name1__ 's desire for cultural homogeneity .
2 . __name1__ 's " __name2__ ".
this is about how the liberal __name1__ , through its protection of high wages and __name2__ jobs , unwittingly created the conservative heyday of the __decade1__ 's .
how did this happen ?
answer : high wages allowed the mother to stay at home and raise the kids .
after __name1__ crushed high wages in __name2__ ( which was done as a gift to big business ) , the mother was forced into the workplace .
this meant kids were raised not by the family , but __name1__ or worse , gangs .
__name1__ voters who have never studied these issues in a rigorous academic context do n't get it .
when __name1__ re @-@ designed the party to serve the interests of capital , he did damage to many conservative causes .
the __name1__ covers up the contradiction __name2__ set in motion through the use of patriotic and religious rhetoric , and through the empty rhetoric of freedom .
they suppress the contradiction between capital and conservatism .
here is the sad part : many posters on this board do n't see the ruse .
they trust __name1__ government deeply .
they are the true useful idiots of government .
until they wake up and get rid of the current __name2__ leadership , they will unwittingly be the dupes of those anti @-@ patriotic forces which destroy __name1__ jobs in the service if capital .
i agree with you wholeheartedly !
i 've said it before , both parties are fucking __name1__ workers .
corporatists and progressives , hand in hand ...
__name1__ is worse than __name2__ .
see __name1__ , which destroyed __name2__ labor .
the old fdr liberals and isolationist conservatives protected the __name1__ worker .
those days are gone .
__name1__ needs a __value1__ rd political party which is not controlled by capital 's need for sweatshop labor .
i remember __name1__ ...
i voted for __name1__ in ' 92 ...
a lot of these problems can be solved if people would just buy only __name1__ made products .
but i guarantee that people will bitch and moan that its __value1__ % more expensive and go right back to the cheap imports .
that 's probably going to depend on whether __quant1__ illegals get amnesty or not .
i know you __name1__ are looking to get that great big voting block , but i do n't think it 's going to happen .
if there were __quant1__ illegals here , that would be __value1__ percent of our population , dipshit .
it 's hard to even find __name1__ @-@ made products any more ...
no kidding , dipshit .
i know what the numbers are , i posted my reasons for posting that number several pages back .
if you want to dispute them , address them and tell me why they 're wrong .
agreed .
because people will buy the cheap imports , which eventually forced most of the __name1__ manufacturers to close up shop because they couldnt compete .
but the really funny thing is that , this is in effect a result of the free market system which the __name1__ touts .....
stick to the topic or shut your piehole , derp ...
" the __name1__ are soooooooo out of touch ! "
is not a " topic ".
it 's a smear .
just like you .
just like the left and the constitution
they put a big stain on it
and yet he was only talking about how pathetic __name1__ are ....
so how can you agree that both parties are fucking us when londoner was only talking about __name1__ ? ....
freedonia ...
firefly @/@ chiccolini __year1__ ......
only way to go ....
he felt the people of nj should vote on it .
he has the right to veto legislation he does n't find appropriate .
federal judges do n't appear to take kindy with voting on this issue .
no , what the federal judges had a problem with was that __name1__ had granted recognition to gay marriage and then took it away .
it was a very narrowly defined ruling .
with __name1__ 's veto , __name2__ has not granted recognition .
that was n't the basis for the decision .
__name1__ vetoes gay marriage
actually i think government belongs out of marriage .
i agree that marriage is between a man and a woman but that can conly be sanctified by god .
render unto ceasar what is ceasar 's .
in this case i think that is beyond ceasar 's bounds .
tell the __name1__
i 'm in a lazy mood right now , so do n't want to sift through the actual ruling , but here is a small snippet from the nytimes :
in __name1__ , a court battle continued .
the state ’s __name1__ had ruled in __month1__ __year1__ that a ban on same @-@ sex marriage was discriminatory , and the state began performing them .
the ban was restored in a referendum that fall by a ballot measure known as __name1__ .
the legality of the __name2__ ban was upheld by the state ’s __name1__ , but in __month1__ __year1__ , a federal judge ruled that it was unconstitutional .
in __month1__ __year1__ , a federal appeals court agreed .
the case is expected to be resolved by the __name1__ .

<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/same_sex_marriage/index.html"> http://topics.nytimes.com/top/refere...age/index.html </a>
where did they say that ?
in their decision .
do you have some link to the section where it talks about it ?
i do n't recall that being a basis for their ruling .
i have the decision :
<a href="http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2012/02/07/1016696com.pdf"> http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastor...1016696com.pdf </a>
see page __value1__ .
i 'm telling the whole world or at least the subset that is on __name1__ message boards right now .
they can like it or lump it .
it matters little to me .
after all , , , ,i 'm just giving my " thoughts ? "
yes , it was .
there is nothing stopping gays from marrying .
nothing .
__name1__ did not just veto their ability to marry .
the only thing that separates a gay marriage from a straight marriage is the government cash and prizes that come with marriage .
that is what __name1__ vetoed .
and that is what makes gay marriage a 14 th __name1__ issue .
see my signature .
that 's not why i got married .
i got married because i loved my wife and wanted our relationship validated
same as gays
and many gays have marriage ceremonies in states that do not recognize them .
just as i 'm sure people in interracial marriages did before they were legal .
should we have kept interracial marriages illegal since marriage is supposed to be about love ?
understand the problem ?
there is no problem .
the governor vetoed a a bill .
it happens every day .
find someone else 's crotch to cry on .
after all , , , ,i 'm just giving my " thoughts ?"
surely you speak euphemistically
it does n't seem to be the crux of the decision , imo .
tell the __name1__
although it seemed to take awhile , you are catching on .
i think you are correct , factfinder .
marriage is a religious institution , the state should only be ruling on civil unions .
this ruling takes away the dignity and status of religious peoples .
then they must not have had much to begin with
as compared to gays and lesbians ?
i agree .
anyone who has to suck the teat of government to establish they are right probably are in a big stretch .
as compared to anyone .
well ...
think on it for awhile .
it really is not that difficult .
interesting when you consider all the important times in life seem to invite a religious element .
most __name1__ believe in __name2__ .
yet , no dignity , hmmm .
__name1__ __value1__ for gay __name2__ daily beast </a>
__name1__ , the former __name2__ vice president known for his hard right stance on almost all matters political , is taking a stand in __name3__ for gay marriage .
__name1__ , whose daughter is openly gay , has been lobbying __name2__ lawmakers as they debate whether or not to legalize same @-@ sex marriage in the state .
__name1__ believes states should legalize gay marriage individually .
__name1__ is for gay marriage ?
holy shit !
maybe the world is going to end in 2012!!!
__name1__ 's daughter is gay .
why would i bother ?
animals eat their own shit too .
any partakers ?
" i am adhering to what i 've said since this bill was first introduced — an issue of this magnitude and importance , which requires a constitutional amendment , should be left to the people of __name1__ to decide , "
seems like he wants the people to make the decision .
and you have a problem with this ?
yes , you cant violate anothers constitutional rights , voting like prop __name1__ in cali was just that.im not sure how many times this has to be told to you people , but seriously buy a clue .
__quant1__ things .
no ones rights are being violated .
" the people " as in , we the people , have every right to amend our constitution .
i do n't know how it is that people can walk and chew gum at the same time if they cannot understand that basic premise .
dumb , dumb dumb ...
__name2__ __name1__ u.s. __value1__ - __value1__ vetoes __value1__ marriage bill </a>
i 've always been a critic of judges who decide they are going to disregard the will of legistlatures and the populace and impose these things , but here 's a case where they did it the right way , they passed a bill , and __name1__ decides he 's stull sucking up to be __name2__ 's running mate .
the governor wants voters to decide yet polls show that a majority of n.j. voters favor same sex marriage .
this veto is a political statement from a governor who needs __name1__ support to move into national politics .
his veto simply delays the inevitable .
<a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-02-17/christie-vetoes-same-sex-marriage-bill-sent-to-him-by-new-jersey-lawmakers.html"> __value1__ christie vetoes __value1__ marriage __name1__ - bloomberg </a>
it 's called representative gov't fcs . more pub dupe balderdash ...
it 's referendums that have ruined __name1__ ...
yea referendums voted in by __name1__ you stupid troop hating asshole ...
i wish to be called a diplomat .
diplomats have rights that i do n't
in their decision .
the __quant1__ judges on tuesday stated explicitly that they were not deciding whether there was a constitutional right for same @-@ sex couples to marry , instead ruling that the disparate treatment of married couples and domestic partners since the passage of __name1__ violated the constitution ’s __name2__ .
“ although the constitution permits communities to enact most laws they believe to be desirable , it requires that there be at least a legitimate reason for the passage of a law that treats different classes of people differently , ” judge __name1__ wrote in the decision .
“ there was no such reason that __name1__ could have been enacted .”
“ all that proposition 8 accomplished was to take away from same @-@ sex couples the right to be granted marriage licenses and thus legally to use the designation ‘ marriage , ’ ” the judge wrote , adding , “ proposition 8 serves no purpose , and has no effect , other than to lessen the status and human dignity of gay men and lesbians in california.” · in his dissenting opinion , judge n. randy smith wrote that the court was overreaching in nullifying a voter initiative .
the flaw here is that the government cannot demand equal protection to a religious institution .
if they had applied that to civil unions , they would be correct .
the flaw in your statement is that " marriage " is not a religious institution ( as on only a religious institution ) .
" marriage " in our society exists in __quant1__ distinct and separate realms : religious marriage and civil marriage .
religious marriage : those marriages established as a function of a religious organization .
there are some religious organizations that recognize same @-@ sex marriages , there are others that do not .
there are religious organizations that do n't recognize valid civil marriages also if the civil marriage occurs outside the dogma of the specific religious organization .
civil marriage : civil marriages are established under the rules and authority of civil government .
individuals can be married by a religious organization , but if they do n't follow civil law , then , as it pertains to civil marriage - those religious marriages are not recognized for governmental purposes .
a couple can be " married " in a church/temple/synagogue , but if they do n't obtain the requisite paperwork from the state that marriage is not valid under civil law .
as soon as " marriage " was written into secular law , it was no longer simply a religious institution , it because a separate civil institution also .
if it were only a religious institution , then the government would need to recognize all religious institutions of " marriage " equally - such as same @-@ sex marriages performed by religious institutions .
as you pointed out they are not the same thing .
blurring the line further is not protecting religious rights .
it makes for a clearer case to reverse the appelate decision .
and yet another reason to get government out of marriage except for governmental matters of taxes , inheritance , and power of attorney for emergencies and medical decisions ....
again..
all a ploy for forced acceptance and government interference on __quant1__ side..
and on the other side , not wanting to reduce government 's scope
power of attorney can be handled locally .
inheritance is a right .
goverment should have diddly to do with it .
taxes should be simplified so that marriage or family relationships are null and void , a non sequitor item .
reality is n't just a show on tv , you know .
oh , government dictates reality ?
what color is the sky on your home planet ?
you can say should be this and should be that , but it ain't gonna happen because you say it , fuckwit
oh you mean self centered people seeking their selfish ways have to have some power dictating to them what they can and cannot do ?
same sex marriage is illogical overall .
government should stay out of any discourse on same .
it should be a state level issue and right , in whatever outcome may come .
there are __quant1__ mitigating issues that brought down all the great civilizations of the past , without exception : they are :
untendable debt · expansionism through endless warring · tolerance of all things sexual .
robert
i disagree .
states must be involve in marriage if we are to have marriage licenses .
although marriages licenses have been used to prevent child marriages , bigamy , interracial marriages , same sex marriage , and transmission of disease , the primary purpose today is to legally document the marriage for tax purpose and many other legal actions .
the lack of legal documentation of marriage , would cause a multitude of problems .
and we need all that for what ?
if you want to file a joint return , have your __name1__ passed on to your spouse without the tax burden , have legal recognition as family , and lots of other stuff you need a document accepted by the government as proof of marriage .
robert
i assert that all government should refrain from all issues pertaining to marriage .
marriage is between man @/@ woman and __name1__ .
period .
correct .
those are all government rules .
i state .
abolish them all .
i take it you do n't think the government should protect the religious rights of religious institutions who perform same @-@ sex marriages by recognizing them equally ?
the decision has based on civil marriage being a secular institution and has nothing to do with recognition or non @-@ recognition of one religious institutions view of what marriage is - it is irrelevant to the question under the secular law .
if the decision were based on the recognition of religous marriage performed by religious institutions - then that would actually be an argument for striking down prop __name1__ and the recognition of different religious ceremonies equally .
come back when the meth wears off
um , yeah , i usually do when people appeal to bigotry to advance their political careers .
__name1__ is a fat sack of shit .
he 's just __quant1__ more __name1__ who does n't get laid and does n't want anyone else to either .
more and more , we 're seeing this about pubs .
in fatso 's case , he has n't even seen his prick since he was in high school .
( okay , maybe he has a mirror glued to a long stick ) his whole world is what ever he can push into his fat face and he 's damn pissed that he can n't hog down a couple dozen donuts without having to up his pants size yet again .
i 'm serious about this .
all you have to do is watch him for a few minutes - he 's a very angry guy and , if he can , he 's gonna make other people pay for it - and then slam down a few big macs and a chocolate shake to feel better .
pretty pathetic but also basic to the gobp @/@ pub __name1__ who do n't want to create jobs but do want to control other people 's private lives .
marriage is a creation of the state ...
not religion .
it is mostly a function of property rights as there are over 1,000 rights and obligations which attach themselves to the status of being married .
" by the power vested in me by the state of _______________ "
you can n't possibly be saying that people married in nonreligious ceremonies are n't as married as people married in religious ceremonies .
oh , i bet he can
i truly hope not .
here are a couple of examples of " marriage " in civil law , abolish civil marriage and here would be no recognition under the law : · 1 . there would be no transfer of property to a spouse ( since there would be no such thing as " spouse " under the law .
as such the surviving spouse would be subject to a tax liability upon the transfer of property between people not recognized as legally married .
2 . it would eliminate the exemption form the estate tax applicable to the sale of a primary home , only civil marriage does that .
( when a home is sold a single person can claim up to $ __quant1__ in an exemption , $ __quant2__ for a civilly married couple .
when one spouse dies the surviving spouse can still claim the married exemption for up to __quant1__ years after the death if the home is sold .
no spouse , no exemption - the survivor is taxed like a single person .)
3 . no spousal privilege in the case of a criminal prosecution .
4 . since there would be no " spouse ", they could not be buried in a __name1__ next to a spouse who was an honorably serving veteran of the __name2__ .
5 . without the legal recognition of " spouse " there would not be automatic conveyance of parenthood upon the birth of a child .
6 . since there would be no spouse , there would be no establish family relationship recognized under the __name1__ so that a person can care for their spouse ( or be cared for by them ) in times of medical emergency .
7 . since there would be no " spouse ", employees would become liable for employer portions of health insurance because there would be no waiving of the tax penalty for employer provided health insurance for a spouse .
( for civily married couples , the employer portion of health insurance is tax free , however on plans where the significant other is not a legal spouse - then the federal government charges that portion as income and is liable for taxation .)
8 .
no " spouse " means no family relationship under social security whereby the surviving spouse can receive benefits at the working spouses rate if higher then their own .
9 . no " spouse " means no established a family relationship where a spouse can then sponsor their spouse for immigration purposes .
and to just round it out to 10 ...
10 .
no " spouse " means that military members will not be able to draw pay and benefits for dependent spouses : no housing allowance , no medical benefits for the spouse , no accompanied tours where the government provides for travel expenses of the spouse , etc...
if there is no civil marriage , there is no recognition , and so those things all disappear .
those are a few things that will happen if the government stops recognizing civil marriage off the top of my head .
i 'm sure that idea will win great support amongst the populous .
these are all f'n government rules .
i say abolish them all .
if i want to transfer property to my goldfish so be it .
the government did n't have any thing to do with it .
government should have nothing to do with inheritance rights ?
really ?
damn ...
and to think every state has trusts and estates laws governing how estates are handled .
these issues have always been dealt with by government .
rights of dower , courtesy , inheritance ,
you claim not to want government interference , yet you 're ok with government interfering in the relationship between __quant1__ people .
and it 's ok for government to tell me i can n't purchase birth control ?
i think you might want to work on consistency .
take away social security from the elderly , take away inheritance without tax exemptions , take away home sales without taxing profit , take away money from military families and the ability to have a spouse moved when transferred on orders , take away job protected leave to care for a sick family member ...
you should run for office , i can see that as a winning platform .
i am not ok with government interfering in marriage .
i thought i made that abundantly clear .
marriage is between the individual and __name1__ .
government cannot and should not attempt to legislate it .
as they should stay out of inheritance and all things marriage related .
i trust that my family members would beat the hell out of anyone who tried to take away any property of mine that belonged ot my wife when i leave .
if we both left at the same time then survival of the fittest suits me fine .
as long as who is left does n't defile common law rules against violence ( the proper place for government ) then all is well .
in other words .
i am a family because i state i am a family .
the government should have zero interference in that .
their tax laws , interference in my retirement plans or lack thereof should be abolished .
it is none of their business and the only reason they have ever ascerted themselves into it was to find out what they could take .
so if marriage is between the individual and __name1__ .
then you would have no problem with the government recognizing as equal all religious marriages between individuals and god based on their individual religious organizations view on the subject correct ?
that if a same @-@ sex couple is married in a religious institution in accordance with their view of what __name1__ allows , that those marriages ( which exist today ) should be recognized equally with other religious marriages ?
or should the government which cannot respect __quant1__ religion over another under the __name1__ , be picking and choosing which religious views are valid .
if the government is to be consistent , then it needs to recognize both , if the government can pick and choose then the governemnt is free to ignore __name1__ doctrine and require __name1__ organization to cover birth control under insurance .
either government has to honor religioius doctrine or it does n't - pick one .
( personally , i do n't have a conflict because their is no one " marriage " and religious marriage is separate from civil marriage .)
i do n't think the government need to recognize anything as pertains to marriage .
it is none of their business .
you know me jill ....
i respect the freedom for anyone to choose to be with whomever they choose in an adult relationship ...
and i respect the freedom for you to purchase any birth control you want..
but ...
i also respect the freedom for people to discriminate or not accept the choices of others ...
someone has the freedom to be an insensitive bigot just as they have the freedom to be an accepting type person ....
i respect the freedom of an employer to choose what benefits they wish to pay for to their employees ...
freedom is a multi directional thing ...
and you have to embrace all parts of it , even if you do n't like it or you do n't get positive benefits from it personally
if we get the hell out of everybody 's private business we willl be the better for it .
private is between me and god .
__name1__ has nothing to do with marriage .
actually __name1__ does have something to do with marriage in the way it ( ss ) is administered .
under the law , if a couple is civilly married for a prescribed number of __quant1__ and __quant1__ or both have been working adults and paid into __name1__ , then upon retirement age if __quant2__ of the spouses had died then the surviving spouse can draw social security based on the deceased spouses contribution if it is higher than their own in recognition of the family support entailed in civil marriage .
they did for my parents when __quant2__ passed a number of __quant2__ before the other .
whether inheretance taxes should exist or not is a discussion for another thread .
the reality is that they do exist and civil marriage brings with it large impacts on the transfer of property between spouses .
the military recognizes the family relationship established as a result of civil marriage and with it awards certain benefits as a result .
__quant1__ such benefit is a military member who has a spouse is eligible for either base housing or additional pay to help provide a place to live for that spouse .
another is that the spouse becomes eligible for health care under the military system and can use __name1__ for civil health care or can be seen at military clinics and hospitals .
another is that when the government orders a military member through __name1__ orders ( pcs ) to relocate from one place to another the military sponsors the spouse to travel and relocate to the new base with their spouse .
for example when i was transferred from __name3__ to japan for __quant1__ @-@ years the military paid for my spouse to accompany me and provided __name1__ government sponsorship for my wife to enter and reside in japan in accordance with the __name2__ agreement between our two countries .
i agree when we in the military are willing to lay down our lives to defend our country , that when we are in a civil marriage all military members should be treated equally .
the same goes for private employers and taking care of their own .
i disagree , it is not the same with private employers .
the military is not the same as a private employer , they are a government employer .
well that is a different argument in a different place but " fair is fair ".
if not get the hell out of there .
that has a lot to do with why i did n't reup after my __value1__ st __quant1__ years .
i wanted to be free to tell someone to go to hell .
i do n't understand how this responds to the specific points address about __name1__ having nothing to do with marriage and about how civil marriage impacts military families .
i can respect your right to believe that .
i just do n't think that once people think beyond the platitude of it and start to examine closely what it means in terms of the __quant1__ federal government laws ( at last count ) , plus hundreds of more state laws , in which marriage was a component of federal and state recognized " rights , responsibilities , and privileges " and that if suddenly the government stopped recognizing the family relationship established under civil marriage and all that that would take away from the people .
the government stopping the recognition of a spouse will have a huge impact - one that i do n't see you gaining a lot of support from heterosexuals for .
they say the hardest job in the military is being a military spouse and my wife was one for most of my military career .
as a retiree she has medical benefits and arrangements have been made ( which are only available to a legal spouse ) that she will receive part of my retirement check if i were to pass before she does so that she will have something to care for herself with .
government non @-@ recognition of civil marriage means she would have no security in our elder years because while she raised our children while i was off defending our country she would have no access to my __name1__ nor my military retirement .
similar situations exist both in the government sector and the private sector - government not recognizing civil marriage is not something that will gain large support .
not looking for support .
just stating my mind .
all those things you mention are the twisted twine ball of the government .
of course my family is entitled to all i have earned when i am gone .
it should be a matter of fact not a goverment regulation .
nor should my family have to deal with the government in any way other than maybe to prove they exist if the government owes me .
bigotry is the __name1__ core value .
and stupidity is yours .
just government " twisted twine " ball ?
lets say that you are a small business owner .
the business is in your name .
one day coming home from work there is a car accident and you are killed and being fairly young and possessing in a sense of invulnerability you have not created a will .
one of the " twisted twines " of government recognition of civil marriage is that if someone passes without a will , their spouse is the inheritor of the estate and it is transferred to the surviving spouse with very little tax liability .
with civil marriage your wife is the recognized heir of your estate and the business passes to her .
without civil marriage the passing of your business ( or portion thereof in the case of join ownership ) would not be viewed as the inheritance of a spouse , it would be viewed as income and therefore liable for taxes .
you owned the business ( or your share ) and ( s ) he owned nothing or his @/@ her share - when your spouse acquired your portion - that is income on their part .
without civil marriage your wife - in the eyes of the law - is not family and is as a stranger to you .
without a will , under the inheritance laws of most states - strangers have no claim on an individuals estate and the property transfers to the next closest blood relative .
( remember a spouse is not a " blood relative ", they are a family member established because of recognition of civil marriage under the law .)
if you have no blood relatives ( or none come forward ) it 's even possible that the estate could pass to the government to dispose of .
you say " nor should my family have to deal with the government in any way other than maybe to prove they exist if the government owes me " yet there is no recognition of civil marriage establishing that bond between you and your spouse , then your spouse is not part of your family .
then you say that your spouse may have to prove that she is your spouse - but that is the government recognizing her as family - something that if the government does n't recognize marriage they would not be able to do .
logically speaking the government cannot " not recognize marriage " then turn around and " recognize marriage " because when they recognize it , then logically they are no longer " not recognizing " it .
what you describe is all more government en " twinings ".
what i am saying is all of that is none of governments business other than to enforce that my family owns my shit .
period end of story end of involvement .
my family is whoever i said it was .
for the government to recognize that your family owns your stuff , you by default need government recognition that you have established a " family " with another person who , prior to some point in time , was not a member of your family .
that 's what civil marriage is , it is the recognition of a family status between __quant1__ people who are not blood relatives .
without that recognition , under the eyes of the law - a spouse is just a live @-@ in boyfriend or girlfriend , they are not family .
well i 'm off to bed .
ff , thanks for the discussion , i 'll leave the __value1__ post of the evening to you .
thanks for the honest discussion and ( something rare around here sometimes ) an honorable exchange of ideas without it devolving into name calling and personal insults .
i enjoyed it immensely .
ww
well , i do n't agree that there is a constitutional " right " to gay marriage .
but i think that the crafting of laws should be left to the legistlature .
that 's their function .
and unlike a referendum , they have the time and ability to craft laws .
the veto power of a governor or president should be reserved for instances when a legislature acts irresponsibly .
here , it has n't .
__name1__ is just sucking up to a larger national stage .
because he knows his fat ass is probalby done in the gubenertorial election of __year1__ .
translation : " i just hate __name1__ and everything they do ."
wow , so like do the voices in you head give you translations to perfectly valid arguments when you can n't refute them .
jabba is sucking up to the national stage , because he knows his shelf life is short .
he 's gone in __year1__ and he knows it .
" throw that teacher to the rancor ! "
we hold these truths to be self evident , that all men are created equal ....
1 ) not in the constitution .
( it 's the __name1__ )
2 ) has nothing to do with whether or not the states ( the only entity that can regulate marriage ) should be able to define who can and can n't get married .
which is why the marriage laws are different in all __quant1__ states .
if you were to argue to me , that the laws should be changed because it 's not unreasonable to let __quant1__ consenting adults marry , even if they are of the same gender , then , yes , that 's not an imposition on anyone .
if you argue to me , marriage is whatever i want it to be because there 's an imaginary " i want to " clause in the 14 th __name1__ , i do n't buy that shit at all .
the 14 th __name1__ has been in the constitution since __year1__ or so .
we are just noticing this now ?
well , gov __name1__ says we get to vote to decide who gets to be equal
yea until the black or brownie wants to move into your neighborhood ....
not in the constitution ?
who cares ?
it is the greatest political statement in the history of man .
until both parties start living up to that it dont mean shit .....
and unfortunately , unless the nj legistlature grows a pair of balls , that 's probably what it 's going to come down to .
or they can wait until he 's tossed out on his can in __year1__ and get a governor who will sign the law .
they may decide who can and can not marry provided the criteria are applied consistently , excluding no particular class of persons , predicated on a compelling governmental reason .
the 14 th __name1__ requires that states and local jurisdictions allow all citizens equal access to the law .
however a given state defines marriage for opposite sex couples , must be applied to same sex couples as well .
__year1__ , actually ; the __name1__ was first incorporated to the states via the 14 th __name2__ in __year2__ , concerning the 5 th __name3__ .
it ’s not so much a matter of noticing it now as it is a conflict concerning its appropriate application .
clay , nice stretching , but the logic of " i want to " in awarding marriage could strike down the incest and polygamy laws on the same basis .
no
gov __name1__ made the call ....
he gets to live with it
he is now the __name1__ of gay rights ......
the only governor ever to veto gay marriage
caving to your political base to make points sure did wonders for wallaces hopes for the presidency
as i recall , __name1__ was doing quite well for the nomination in __year1__ , until someone shot him .
then the __name1__ had a collective brain fart and nominated __name2__ ....
so only religious people should be married , dd ?
you want __quant1__ tiers of relationships ?
one for religious folk and one for secular ?
if you do n't want government interference , i 'm sure you 'll agree that government should stay out of my uterus .
never said that jill ...
since when did i ever state anything like only religious people should get married ?
i think govt should stay out of your uterus ...
and also away from the life someone is trying to carve out of someone 's uterus
i agree that marriage is between a man and a woman but that can only be sanctified by __name1__ .
the founders were governed by social mores and never intended to insert religious mores into formal laws .
all things governing religion were so important to the founders , they included freedom of religion in the first __name1__ .
i 'm not buying the legal world prying at society 's girders to foist an anything @-@ goes society on __name1__ 's heads .
it 's absolutely unwise because we came over here on boats from a corrupt __name2__ system based on all the assets in the government 's hands crushing __name1__ believers .
our ancestors came here to escape that .
why would we bring all that back , along with the big government it takes to crush dissent ?
it 's less wise to do such a thing than you think , imho .
is n't it funny how __name1__ does the right thing when it affects him personally ?
this is a favorite meme for which i have never seen evidence .
these are what i call the marriage " cash and prizes " the government protects by law .
the bigotry toward gays is so great , bigots are willing to cut their own throats rather than give homos the same protection under the law as them .
right .
a liberal thinks there are all sorts of rights hidden in the 14 th __name1__ @- gay marriage , abortion on demand ...
can you show us where interracial marriage is protected in the constitution ?
actually it is in the constitution , in the form of the 14 th __name1__ :
all persons born or naturalized in the united states , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the __name1__ and of the state wherein they reside .
no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the __name1__ ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .
because our rights are inalienable , no state may deny any citizen due process of the law , or equal access to the law .
when __name1__ __value1__ appeared it was spread by gay men amongst each other .
then it spread to straight people via bisexual sex and shared needles .
today many more straight people than gays have __name1__ .
all are unhealthy lifestyles .
when __name1__ __value1__ appeared it was contracted by heterosexuals and transferred between heterosexuals before spreading to homosexuals .
when __name1__ first appeared as a mutation of siv ( __name2__ , confirmed through __name3__ testing ) and passed to humans it is believe either through consumption of raw @/@ undercooked meat or through blood exposure to a wound when humans hunted the animals .
the majority of __name1__ infections have been because of heterosexual relations .
__name1__ neither " appeared " in gay men nor have the majority of the cases in the world been spread by gay men .
btw you skipped these questions : · 1 . so you are cool with lesbians getting a civil marriage because they have the lowest incidence of __name1__ infection ?
( or is it just homosexual males you have an issue with [ which takes it back to being gender specific].)
2 . would you support __name1__ testing as part of civil marriage requirements for all participants and the refusal of a license if an individual tests positive for hiv ?
what has __name1__ got to do with marriage ?
nothing that 's what .
i was talking about all unhealthy lifestyles .
i was referring to when it started in __name1__ .
<a __value1__ the __name1__ of __name2__ and __name3__ in america </a>
marriage helps prevent the spread of __name1__ by encouraging monogamous relationships
how does what some perceive to be a civil right have anything to do with the rule of law ?
nobody has a right to marry , period , it is not in the constitution , therefore states have always handled marriage and marriage laws .
it does n't matter if it 's gay marriage or not , it simply is not a right , and that wont change by calling it a civil right or a human right or blah blah blah .
just because you change the terminology does not mean it changes the law as it is written .
if people want gay marriage , then get out the vote and have people vote it in .
so you disagree with the __name4__ ruling that struck down state laws on interracial civil marriage because even though the 14 th __name1__ required __name2__ and __name3__ under the law , that did n't apply to colored people ?
btw - all citizens have a right to equal treatment under the law barring a compelling government interest and if they feel they have been wronged by the government they have a constitutional right to address such grievances through the courts .
yep , when you think about civil marriage promoting monogamous relationships*** then it actually become an argument for allowing sames @-@ sex civil marriage .
*** if you do n't think civil marriage promotes monogamy , then ask someone whose been cause cheating on his @/@ her spouse and how they got taken to the cleaners in the divorce .
lol , i agree with __name1__ on this one , though ithink he did it purely for politidcal gain and not because it was the right thing to do .
he did the right thing , it is up to the people to decide , not for the state government to dictate .
then you are a statist conservative progressive : you support mass democracy , not representative republicanism .
i dont live in virginny .
i made the comment on a .............
wait for it message board
i know , i made a comment on a .............
i am not blaming non compromise on anyone .
that is my position , and guess what ...
hard to believe as it is .
im independent and havent voted for a repub since __year1__ .
funny thing is you said " it 's like the more shenanigans the libtards play , the less willing people are to seek middle ground at all ."
i do n't see any reference as a counterpoint the shenanigans by social authoritarians to deny same @-@ sex couples equal treatment under the law .
when one blames one side and ignores the other , that 's usually indicative of - well - blaming one side .
personally i wish all of them the best .
politically they can kiss my ass .
if you cant leave me alone , i wont leave you alone .
i am an asshole that way .
so people that are being denied equal treatment under the law are n't supposed to try to correct that .
you are probably just a good guy , they are the assholes for their expectations .
discrimination is discrimination .
i dont know what more i can add .
i am and have always been the guy that pushes back .
the guy never afraid to kick the table over .
in doing so you usually get quicker resolution .
it 's not based on gender .
it 's about a very unhealthy and harmful lifestyle .
what makes it unhealthy and harmful is the hatred directed at gays
no it 's the disease called __name1__ .
then you support gay marriage for lesbians then ...
because you heteros have a worse record on __name1__ than we do .
1 . so you are cool with lesbians getting a civil marriage because they have the lowest incidence of __name1__ infection ?
see testing everyone for __name1__ and then refusing a civil marriage license would not be discriminatory based on gender .
p.s. you realize there are more heterosexuals with __name1__ @/@ __name1__ infections then homosexuals , right ?
__name1__ first appeared in __name2__ and it was not gay men ....
but feel free to continue your little bugaboo .
can you point me to the part of the constitution that gives you a right to marry ?
because i have yet to find it anywhere in there .
you are the one who is clueless .
you cannot claim that what you consider to be a human or civil right is also a constitutional right , it does not work that way .
it 's right next to the part that gives you the right to marry .
__name1__ did not run as a __name2__ .
they rejected him and what he stood for .
he did in __year1__ ; go look it up .
you are correct , in __year1__ , he ran as a __name1__ after repudiating segregation .
in __year1__ , while still supporting segregation , he ran as the __name1__ candidate .
palimony suits do not take you to the cleaners .
the __quant1__ are different .
unlike alimony , palimony settlements usually involve a lump sum paid at once , versus permanent __quant1__ payments .
a further difference is that palimony does not divide " common assets ."
in a palimony suit , the legal owner of any assets gets those assets without question , even if the partner has paid into them and considers them common property .
you can get fleeced with a palimony suit just as readily as a divorce .
why are you automatically assuming that marriage will end in divorce ?
i 've been in a monogamous relationship with my life partner for over __quant1__ years now .
why is n't our relationship deserving of the same rights , benefits , privileges and protections of legal civil marriage that is granted heterosexual couples ?
got anything that will stand up in a court of law as a reason to deny me this equality ?
i am not assuming , the statistic 's say that there is a very large number of marriages end in divorce whether it be straight or gay 's .
i also said that you should have the same rights but doing it with laws .
i also said why it harms the nation as a whole .
couples living together .
sex without marriage .
drug abuse , porn , sex trafficking , alcoholism and homosexuality , pedophiles and bestiality .
whenever these type of sins become accepted by society , civilization starts to decay and fall .
all of this leads to the decline of the family unit .
a husband and wife who raise their families .
when things go well with the family , life is worth living , when the family falters , life falls apart .
when deadly sins like pedophiles , bestiality and homosexuality are accepted it decays the moral and spiritual values in a well ordered civilization .
families are the foundation of a nation .
when one sin becomes more acceptable others follow .
if you get your marriage rights , what is stopping the next one , which is those that want to marry their animal sex partners .
they are coming out of the closet around the world now and are speaking out about their civil rights also .
do you think couples who are not virgins should be allowed to marry ?
is n't that a deadly sin ?
our single parent birthrate is now at __value1__ %
liberals seem to think __name1__ can do a better job then the actual fathers .
__name1__ has always said , even during his election , that if it came to his desk , he would veto a bill on gay 's getting married .
so it came to his desk and unbelievable , he did what he said he would do .
now governor __name1__ has said that he wants the citizens of __name2__ to vote on the matter .
oh my gawd !
the audasity of this man !
now i realize that for the left , a politician doing exactly what he said he would do is unique .
i mean look at __name1__ and his pals .
the poster child for saying one thing in the campaign and doing another in reality .
we could start with __name1__ declining public financing .
we could move to __quant1__ dollars in debt being " unpatriotic ", but let 's not bore everyone with details .
besides the left is not big on facts .
states have the ability to define what marriage is .
in __name1__ we have a constitutional amendment that defines it as __quant1__ man and __quant2__ woman .
further , our state does not recognize marriages that do not conform to that definition from other states .
it is a state issue and it should be .
do n't like it ?
then do n't live there .
i also think that when prop __name1__ from __name2__ gets to the __name3__ , it 's going to be bad news for those of you that want it over turned .
but hey , we 'll see .
no it is not a deadly sin .
but homosexuality is even worse , __name1__ says it 's an abomination , worse that a deadly sin .
if more people would stop having sex any old time they wished , with as many people as they wanted to , the sexual diseases in this nation would decline dramatically though .
in justifying his impending veto , __name1__ also said that blacks wished that there could have been a vote on civil rights ......
it would have saved them a lot of aggravation
thou shall not commit adultery is __quant1__ of the __quant2__ commandments .
homosexuality was never mentioned as a commandment
i do n't understand why you would want to be subject to divorce laws .
where your partner could take you to the cleaners .
it 's so much better when , if your partner dies , you have no protection from their family taking everything ....
right .
where does your __name1__ say that ?
read post __value1__
why do you think that commandment is there ?
lucy goosey sex causes diseases and eventually death .
it does not matter what your sexual preference 's are .
__name1__ 18 @:@ 22 reads , " thou shalt not lie with mankind , as with womankind : it is abomination ."
__name1__ 20 @:@ 13 .
it reads , " if a man also lie with mankind , as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination : they shall surely be put to death ; their blood shall be upon them ."
the verses above from __name2__ are in a section of the __name1__ that lists immoral acts and the penalties for them .
homosexual activities are listed right alongside other immoral acts such as having sex with animals , incestuous relationships , adultery , etc. __name1__ does not say that this behavior is something that you should have " gay pride " about .
__name1__ calls it a sexual sin and says that because of such practices , the nations in the land were being cast out .
__name1__ 18 @:@ 24 , 30 reads , " defile not ye yourselves in any of these things : for in all these the nations are defiled which i cast out before you .
therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance , that ye commit not any one of these abominable customs which were committed before you , and that ye defile not yourselves therein : i am the __name1__ your __name2__ ."
and if we continue to be a nation that allows sex with anyone , any time with anyone .
he will turn his back on us and we will no longer have his blessings .
the majority of this nation believes in __name1__ and believes that he will turn on us .
this is why homosexuality is a great harm to our society .
it always amuses me , this cafeteria christianity ....
now you follow the __name1__ , now you do n't .
answer me this ...
why are you not following all of __name1__ ?
you do n't happen to be a member of the __name1__ do you ?
ah ...
so the __name1__ with the most believers wins ?
and here i thought this was a secular country when it was really a __name1__ popularity contest .
this has never been a secular nation , ever .
from the beginning it has been a __name1__ nation and it still is a christian nation .
i have lost many gay friends in the 80 's and 90 's .
all of them from __name1__ .
most __name1__ do not hate gay 's , they hate the sin .
i do n't write these things to judge anyone .
but as a __name1__ , i believe what __name2__ 's word tells me .
and i care enough about each of you to share with you __name1__ 's truth .
__quant1__ also care about this nation and if we continue down the path that we are going we will most defiantly fall as a nation .
bullshit .
bullshit
so ...
why do n't you follow , and want our laws to follow all of __name1__ ?
you have n't answered that yet .
because gays are yucky and lobster tastes good
peach must be busy .
she 's on line here but has n't answered as to whether or not she follows all of __name1__ , and whether or not she want 's our nation 's laws to follow all of leviticus .
with me it was because being homosexual is unhealthy , but still have n't seen a response to post #267 .
opposing gay marriage is now bigotry ?
priceless ....
bullshit .
drinking already ?
it 's about unhealthy lifestyles .
not dictating .
alcoholics die fairly young · drug users die young · smokers die young · overeating you die fairly young · homosexuals die fairly young .
[/quote ]
so , in order to not appear the self @-@ righteous hypocrite , you are fighting to keep all of those groups from being afforded civil marriage licenses .
right ?
( btw , are you aware that one of the fastest growing businesses catering to gay clientele is the retirement community business ? ....
so much for " dieing fairly young ")
to those of you invoking the __name2__ , again ( yawn ) , so what if your __name1__ thinks someone is a " sinner "...?
wake up and get a clue , __name1__ said we are all sinners , so please do try to get past that point with your failed logic ...
the __name1__ constitution does not defer to the __name2__ and the __name3__ does not exclude sinners .
all persons born or naturalized in the united states , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the __name1__ and of the state wherein they reside .
no state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the united __name1__ ; nor shall any state deprive any person of life , liberty , or property , without due process of law ; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws .
do you know the intention of the text which you are quoting ?
mike
oh shut the fuck up ...
yeah , kinda like prop __name1__ that was democratically voted on ? ?
or __name1__ up in __name2__ who was democratically elected , then passed an anti @-@ collective bargaining law in which __name3__ ran to __name4__ and are now trying to recall him ? ?
how about __name1__ threatening to veto any bill that is passed by the __name2__ that makes it passed __name3__ ? ?????
but yeah , i bet no leftist slime fuck would have a problem with __name1__ vetoing a bill..
as usual progressives are pathetic fucks ...
so what is the difference ?
if alcoholics die fairly young , drug users die fairly young , smokers die fairly young , obese people die fairly young and homosexuals die fairly young .
why is it only __quant1__ of the identified groups is being barred from civil marriage ( in most places ) .
then logic dictates that it is not the " unhealthly lifestyle " which is the reason for barring them from civil marriage when others who live unhealthy lifestyles are not barred from civil marriage .
the reality is that " unhealthy lifestyle " is a dodge , a rationalization because it is not logically supported .
__name1__ @/@ __name1__ related deaths were __quant1__ ( the lowest of the listed groups ) , with smoking related deaths were __quant2__ ( the highest ) .
people are 2347.94 times more likely to die from smoking then from being a homosexual .
yet smokers are allowed to civilly marry but homosexuals are not ( in most places ) .
the argument that the focus is that it is more " unhealthy " does not ring true .
so much for " dieing fairly young ")[/quote ]
how many times do i have to say that gay 's should have their rights under the law ?
i bet you that they did not run around on their partners either and that 's how they made it to a ripe old age .
where do you find a right in the constitution ?
without using interpretation , show me where you think that the right to be married lies in the constitution ?
better yet , show me where that authority is taken away from the states ?
mike
gee ...
you got us there .
no one has the right to marry .
you are correct .
the power for that has been left to the states .
( or we could just vote to have the state the hell out of our vows and have all marriages treated like contracts ? )
mike
makes you wonder how many lives could be saved if our society had a different view of drugs and drug users .
i wish we viewed it as a disease and as an opportunity to help people , rather than an opportunity to throw someone in jail .
and dont ' read into that wrong , i 'm not advocating gov't set up some huge program .
makes you wonder how many lives could be saved if our society had a different view of celebrities , drugs and drug users .
celebrities i agree , we should n't worship them , i 've never understood that .
but i do n't get why we should hate someone , who after using a drug one time , has their mind altered so much that their brain demands they use again no matter the ramifications .
this coming from me , someone who 's never once used any illegal drug .
not even weed .
is that what you believe ?
that using a drug once alters one 's mind enough that their brain demands it ?
sorry , i ain't buying it .
we control our minds .
our minds do not control us .
this coming from someone who has smoked weed and from someone who has turned her life around for the better , knowing that everything i need comes from within .
but , i needed the assistance of outside sources to learn the powerful source i have within .
if it pumps their nadds to do so ...
who cares .
__name1__ __value1__ __name2__ __value1__ flag plan </a>
gov __name1__ has ordered that all state flags in nj be lowered to half mast this saturday to honor __name2__
is it appropriate ?
yes .
no it 's not .
why honor a crackhead ?
ask a doctor how many uses it takes to get hooked on cocaine or meth .
one time , and a normally good person could get turned right into a fuck up .
i think we should use it as an opportunity to get the good person back , rather than throw that person in prison .
you goto prison for selling not using .
i 'm sure after getting caught using enough times you 'll go to jail .
but even still , removing the black market for selling drugs would keep a lot of non @-@ violent ppl out of prisons .
absolutely not ! !!!
that would be a disgrace ...
i have a hard time believing a guy like __name1__ would do such a thing - yet he did .
fucking __name1__ ...
__name1__ was no goddamn patriot and is not deserving of such a " communication " of honor .
whoa ...
i pulled the ' give @-@ a @-@ shit ' meter out of the desk drawer and i could n't even get it to register .
__name1__ is within his rights as governor ...
yup and if the gov in nj wants to honor __name1__ then so what .
i 'm sure he 'll hear from the residents of __name1__ if they do n't like it .
__name1__ flew its flags at half staff when __name2__ was killed and no one gave a shit .
was he an alcoholic drug addict too ?
i did n't know that .
was that a __name1__ flag or a __name2__ flag ?
the __name1__ flag is still worthy of respect .
the __name1__ flag gets crapped on and burned .
by the left .
or had n't you noticed .
let me ask you a similarly stupid question .
did you ask that because she is black and he was white ?
for the record i could n't stand him but your question was beyond idiotic .
no , i do not think it is any way appropriate to lower the flag for an ....
entertainer .
nooooooooo .........
i asked because he was a __name1__ driver and the __name2__ flag gets more air time than the __name3__ flag
you mean because she did n't anonymously battle evil liberals on an internet message board like you ?
pos .
personally , i oppose it
not because she was a drug user but because her primary contribution was a pop music star
i think putting flags at half staff should be reserved for military , police , firefighters , public servants and not for someone who was just famous
you know , there was a public school of the arts named for her in __name1__ . do you know how much money she gave to that school and others ?
do you know what type of contributions she made to the state ?
i do n't , .
btw ...
and i 'm kind of thinking it 's a little silly to do this , but it really does n't change the world .
i honestly do n't know .
but what i do know is for a generation now we have tried to label bad behavior as a medical condition .
that removes any element of personal responsibility and as such we 've had a generation of youth drugged by doctors diagnosis 's of this ailment or that .
it 's sad
to make the painful decision to inter the appropriate rehab for the condition and stick with it takes plenty of personal responsibility .....
as for the op , not a fan of the governor by any stretch but i 'm fine with the decision .
do you think that rehab works ?
did it work for any weinhouse ?
she wrote a song about how it does n't work .
it made her a lot of money .
did rehab work for __name1__ ?
did rehab work for __name1__ ?
rehab does n't work .
the function of rehab is to teach people how to be more creative in assigning blame for their addictions .
we honor the absolute worst among us .
schools lower flags to half mast to honor gang bangers who are murdered by other gang bangers .
tell that to all the people who have been helped by __name1__ .
__name1__ was knocking back straight whiskeys at 8am the day she died after a night of heavy partying .
it takes real committment to the lifestyle to find this honorable .
__name1__ might want to lower their company flag to half mast .
that i can see .
__name1__ might want to lower it 's flag to half mast .
there might have been a time when __name1__ was a worthy person and could sing .
that has n't been for __quant1__ years at least .
at the time of her death she was reprehensible .
link ?
idiot ...
the icbm force was moved from __name3__ to __name1__ to align the icbms and bombers under " __quant1__ __name2__ commander " to increase the focus on nukes .
your dumbass did n't know that .
towards the end of __name2__ 's time at __name3__ he was in charge __name5__ space and cyberspace for the __name1__ , but now at __name4__ he is in charge __name5__ all dod space , cyberspace , bombers , slbms and ( drumroll ) icbms .
your claim that we only have " __quant1__ " icbms at " __quant2__ " missile bases spread out across an area larger than __name1__ shows you are the biggest dumbass on this board next to rdean .
you are digging to __name1__ .
__name1__ floated the idea of cutting our nuclear arsenal by __value1__ % to the __name2__ .
the response back to the __name2__ from the __name1__ ....
" nuts ! "
actual words from __name1__ , who knows what icbm 's are worth today ; he has discussed upgrading a whole __quant1__ icbm 's for possible use as backup missiles : · ************************************************** * · our mission is to provide an integrated constellation of space and · cyberspace capabilities at the speed of need , and our vision is to be · the leading source of emerging and integrated space and cyberspace · capabilities .
at __name2__ , we look forward to assuming the lead role for · cyberspace within the __name1__ .
__name1__ operations in the air , space , and · cyberspace domains are mutually @-@ supporting and reciprocally @-@ enabling ; · the cyberspace domain is inextricably linked to the other domains in · which the __name2__ military operates .
not only must we protect these · domains , we must also properly integrate them with the other · operational domains to create joint warfighting effects significantly · greater than the sum of the parts .
our capabilities are woven through · joint operations , weapons networks , and civil and economic activities · ranging from missile warning to the position , navigation , and timing · signals we provide both for military use and as a free , international · utility .
space and cyberspace capabilities shape the __name1__ approach to · warfare , are embedded in an ever @-@ more effective arsenal of modern · weaponry and are threaded throughout the fabric of our warfighting · networks .
our space @-@ based capabilities are absolutely vital to the · joint fight .
yesterday 's irregular warfare is today 's regular warfare ; · asymmetric warfare is the new norm .
space capabilities contribute · across the spectrum of regular and irregular combat and non @-@ combat · operations and provide joint commanders a decisive advantage .
space is · no longer just the high ground ; it is a critical joint enabler and · force multiplier .
idiot , if we lower our numbers to say 4 , __name1__ to 6 , and __name2__ to 4 ....
we are losing the ability to counter " both " threats .
throw in __name1__ getting nukes along with nk 's nukes .
it 's clear your tiny brain does n't understand deterrence .
yeah , __name1__ and __name2__ are our friends and do n't have nukes .
__name1__ is also one of our buddies too .....
eh ?
the __name1__ is over , amazing how many people still get a feeling of security from having the ability to sterilize the biosphere .
keep enough to merely destroy mankind and shitcan the rest .
typical all or nothing response , who is talking about getting rid of them ?
i am suggesting that the ready capability for total __name1__ is a useless waste of money and resources .
we almost certainly have the capability to destroy the bulk of mankind several times over , we could lose much of it and still maintain an acceptable balance of terror for scared people like yourself .
how many nukes do we have ?
do we really need them all ?
how many times over do we need to destroy the __name1__ as habitable for humans
i 've been hearing that since the 60 s .
same ole , same ole .
when we 're no longer the biggest kid on the block you will get the answer to your questions .
besides , this country has become too chicken shit to use nukes ever again anyway .
we are rapidly losing the global economic war .
actually global economics and enhanced communications have made for a smaller interlinked world .
which makes for less of a nuke threat .
we would not want to nuke our factories in __name1__ now would we ?
of course we will always have some rogue elements in all societies that could obtain and use nukes .
the more that are laying around the greater the chance of that .
oh come on peachy thinks we 've hidden nuclear bombs underneath her trailer park ...
all __quant1__ of those icbms .
but ....
she did n't answer your question .
you did not answer my question .
there is no answer ; that problem remains .
some of the material ( as nuclear components are termed ) is buried .
deep underground in areas where there are few earthquakes , or in lots of concrete .
*********************************************** · in the __name2__ alone , the __name1__ states there are " __quant1__ of gallons of radioactive waste " as well as " __quant2__ of tons of spent nuclear fuel and material " and also " huge quantities of contaminated soil and water ."
[ 13 ] despite copious quantities of waste , the doe has stated a goal of cleaning all presently contaminated sites successfully by __year1__ .
[ 13 ] the __name1__ , __name2__ site for example had " __quant1__ pounds of uranium product ", " __quant2__ pounds of waste ", " __quant3__ cubic yards of contaminated soil and debris ", and a " __quant4__ acre portion of the underlying great __name3__ aquifer had uranium levels above drinking standards ."
[ 13 ] the __name1__ has at least 108 sites designated as areas that are contaminated and unusable , sometimes many __quant1__ of acres .
[ 13][14 ] doe wishes to clean or mitigate many or all by __year1__ , however the task can be difficult and it acknowledges that some may never be completely remediated .
in just __quant4__ of these __quant5__ larger designations , __name1__ , there were for example at least " 167 known contaminant release sites " in __quant1__ of the __quant2__ subdivisions of the __quant3__ @-@ acre ( 150 km2 ) site .
[ 13 ] some of the __name1__ sites were smaller in nature , however , cleanup issues were simpler to address , and doe has successfully completed cleanup , or at least closure , of several sites .
[ 13 ] · ******************************** · some of this is from old nukes .
nuclear plants and nuclear medical waste , not weapons .
__name1__ gets his orders from skynet through the teleprompter he keeps in the lincoln bathroom .
i owe you rep.
but ....
we only have " __quant1__ " icbms according to you , so that is close to my example of __quant2__ .
now ....
the trick question is how many " nukes " are on each icbm .....
" used nuclear arsenal ? "
we want to have reserves if a war breaks out or enough to make other side think twice about pulling a fast one on us .
if they have __quant1__ bombs and you lower your numbers to __quant2__ bombs , they might get the crazy idea of taking out your __quant2__ bombs with say 5 @-@ 6 of their bombs ...
then they own you .
we have thousands of active nuclear weapons , not " __quant1__ ".
true , our problem was getting ours to " them " before theirs got to the __name1__ .
slbm 's and cruise missiles helped even out the geographical disadvantage .
yeah , we should get rid of nukes and not threaten __name1__ with them because they have our debt .
instead we should just surrender to them ...
right ?
idiot , __name1__ is n't part of __name2__ .
__name1__ does n't mind if obamination lowers our nukes with " promises " from __name2__ doing the same or slightly less like they typically do .
uh , the word is leaking out that obamination floated the idea which would be a surrender order if followed by the __name1__ .
i 'm sure __name1__ kindly said ....
" this would endanger our nation if executed ."
under his breath he said " nuts ."
a dew facts which belie the rightwing claims : · ****************************************** · the __name2__ 's press secretary , __name1__ , declined to comment on specific force level options because they are classified .
he said __name1__ had asked the __name2__ to develop several " alternative approaches " to nuclear deterrence .
the __name1__ could make further weapons reductions on its own but is seen as more likely to propose a new round of arms negotiations with __name2__ , in which cuts in deployed weapons would be one element in a possible new treaty between the former __name3__ adversaries .
stephen young , senior analyst at the __name1__ , which favors nuclear arms reductions , said tuesday , " the administration is absolutely correct to look at deep cuts like this .
the __name1__ does not rely on nuclear weapons as a central part of our security ."
you are hilarious !
the start ( __name1__ ) has nothing to do with the rotation of the __name2__ favoring a missile launched from the __name4__ __name5__ hitting __name3__ before one launched from __name3__ hit the __name5__ .
it is the rotation of the __name1__ which influences strike .
since peachy thinks we only have __quant1__ icbms and they are used as " back @-@ ups , " we need to notify the __quant2__ launch control officers and +200 security forces and maintenance personnel currently in the missile complexes that they can go home tonight ...
it 's clear you are in an insane asylum .
here is the __value1__ part of the quote :
due to historic activities typically related to radium industry , uranium mining , and military programs , there are numerous sites that contain or are contaminated with radioactivity .
idiot ...
he is pointing out cyberspace can do more for us without huge damage like icbms .
but of course , you figured he meant to get rid of icbms because cyberspace is a new tool .
icbms are the our last line of defense for this country along with bombers and slbms ....
so they will be used last , but if you idiots get rid of them then there is no last line of defense .
a real quote from general __name1__ , not from the confounded mind reader , who is sure he knows what kahler is thinking :
and the military command in charge of a cyberattack now believes it ’s legally in the clear to conduct “ offensive operations of any kind , ” __name2__ gen. __name1__ , its chief , told __name3__ .
if there is an __name2__ attack on __name3__ , __name1__ military planners will probably be taking notes .
**************************************** · cyber attack capability is what the __name1__ wants , and needs .
that is why __name1__ speaks of space & technology , not the outdated icbm 's .
disarming the opponent by computers is at the forefront of nuclear technology in this century , and millenium .
jeeze , who is talking about getting rid of them ?
no one .
uh , __name1__ got rid of old icbm systems because we had the mmiii in place .
the mmiiis are being upgraded and there is no alternative to them .....
idiot .
some are outdated , some redundant .
i doubt those opposed to cuts understand how many we have .
that 's what he did with the __name1__ treaty - he got several other countries to give up live weapons while we gave only outdated and unusable weapons .
i read this on couple of news sites .
we do n't rely on nuclear weapons and we can , at this time , kill other countries something like 700 times over .
so we get rid of some older weapons and can only kill other countries 400 times over .
so what .
this is the kind of the thing the rw 's just love to go off half cocked about .
i 'll bet the email lies are flying back and forth .
__value1__ rule - do n't confuse them with facts .
funniest part of this is that this is what __name1__ tried to do .
lol
you are just a nut and a dumb one too , on the internet talking to someone that briefed __name1__ numerous times .....
he came into my office one morning and warned me about eating __name1__ food for breakfast .
it is clear you know little about nuclear weapons .
__value1__ means sea launched ballistic missiles .
that and cruise missiles are our primary defense sources .
even in __year1__ , a negotiator at the original salt __name1__ told my class " we have cruise missiles that could hit the men 's room of the __name2__ ".
the man 's name is __name1__ .
he knew quite a bit about the subject ; if you know anything about the history of nuclear weapons , you have heard of him .
that 's nice ; those who go by the name gone " bezerk " obviously think about the mental health of others .
did you discuss icbm 's in cyberspace with the general , or did the nice men in white coats put the cloth restraints back on ?
obamination said he hopes to get rid of all nukes someday .
that is the plan ....
to slowly get rid of them .
he lowered the numbers soon as getting into office and wa @-@ laa he now wants more cuts .....
huge cuts .
shocking .....
little girl , you spell his name wrong .
your crackhead is busy looking up stuff on __name1__ to try to keep up with me with your made up stuff too .
__quant1__ worked in this world for __quant1__ before moving on to new things that are even more cutting edge and on the news than this ....
there are nuts in the __name1__ that want __quant1__ nukes , i 've seen them up close .
the point is lowering our nuke levels with promises from __name1__ is stupid when we end up with less nukes than __name2__ and russia in addition to nk . it is a numbers game that you do n't want to be inferior for survival .
if the __name1__ @-@ __name2__ alliance thingy ever comes back someday , we 'd be screwed .
worst case scenario ( for you anyway ) ends with us having __quant1__ deployed nukes , is that not enough ?
how about 700 ?
how about the __quant1__ we have now ?
or the thousands of others we could assemble in short order ?
what is an acceptable number for you ?
your love of these obscene weapons is pretty damned creepy .
there is no way we will ever have __quant1__ nukes , quit worrying about that .
the __name1__ is over , the need for a balance of terror is not as acute and we could store them in a way where they could be called into service quickly if an arms race ever heated up , keep a few hundred ready and be no worse off except we save several __quant1__ dollars __quant2__ year .
there is no way on earth we need to keep __quant1__ nukes ready at all times , it 's a waste .
i would love to live in a world where there are no nukes but it 's not going to happen , if we are stuck with them i would prefer a program that matches the actual threat , not paranoid fantasies .
shut the fuck up , idiot .
slbms are not replacing icbms , we still have __quant1__ missile wings located in wy , nd and mt. slbms serve a different purpose than icbms in our overall scheme which you do n't have a clue about , cleatus .
the rest of your alcms and siop rundown is .....
dumbass ....
the icbm force is pretty cost efficient .
the weapons last for __quant1__ and require minimum maintenance compared to tanks , ships and airplanes .
they are the biggest bang for the buck and have kept your sorry ass protected ever since you started sucking o2 .
icbm 's are being replaced by slbm 's .
cruise missiles are the best course .
the launch of an icbm would be immediately detected .
and weapons launched from the former __name2__ would hit the __name1__ __value1__ even if launched a short time later .
( rotation of the __name1__ ) .
we need marine based slbm 's and cruise missiles , not icbm 's .
********************************************* · " additionally , icbms are generally considered to be nuclear only ; although several conceptual designs of conventionally @-@ armed missiles have been considered , the launch of such a weapon would be such a threat that it would demand a nuclear response , eliminating any military value to such a weapon ."
********************************************* · any general in the __name1__ who says nuts to reducing icbm 's needs to retire or be in a mental health facility .
you seem , uh , distressed by facts bezerk .
i brought up slbm 's & cruise missiles which are are primary nuclear weapons .
the focus now however , is on cyber attacks .
catch up on your reading .
or have someone read about recent technology to you .
yeah , i came here to lie to impress a twit like you .
sorry that some of us in life and done things you do n't know about ....
like flown a jet , been in a submarine , worked with nukes , etc , etc.
um , i worked with them for around __quant1__ years ....
i know about the siop than you do .
sure you did and i 'm sure you can prove it too .
right ?
you do n't want to believe others when they talk about their service .
why should anyone here take your word for it ?
__name1__ worship of greed
__name2__ want their precious government to track , control and redistribute every dollar in our economy , and it 's " __name2__ " who are greedy ....
what a moron , then again bigots are ...
we always hear about the redistrubution of wealth from the right but facts clearly show that there has been a redistribution of wealth upwards for __quant1__ .
funny how some folks on the right ignore that fact .
like good little sheep , they willingly move along to the slaughter of __name1__ 's core , main street __name1__ .
chart 1 , represents the redistribution of icome .
chart 2 , represents the decline of the working classes share of the national income .
the " working class " represents a huge majority of __name1__ .
__name1__ represents everything that is kind of wrong with the __name2__ today .
it 's the kind of self defeating mentality of a coyote who chews off __quant1__ legs and is still caught in the trap .
let 's talk about what makes the __name1__ admirable .
it is a party of limited government , self @-@ reliance and freedom to persue happiness .
absolutely good traits .
but the firewall against creeping __name2__ __name1__ is a strong middle class with skin in the game .
one that can have pride in bringing home a paycheck .
a middle class , unfortunately , the __name1__ romneys of the world have been doing their very best to dismantle .
get rid of that good paying union job at __name1__ , move that good paying job at ddi to __name2__ , make bigger profits for your investors .
we 'll replace them with mcjobs at __name1__ and __name2__ that pay minimum wage and have no benefits .
when you take away the ability of working people to make good money , when they require food stamps and school lunches to feed their kids , when they need section 8 vouchers to put a roof over their head , when they need a earned income credit to make up for the money they are n't earning at their jobs at __name1__ , when they have to apply for medicaid to see a doctor , or rely on social security because they sharks on __name2__ made a killing manipulating the market while they were locked into crashing __name3__ 's .
when you do these things , you create more dependence on government .
you make it more palatable for people , and they are more inclined to vote for __name1__ .
oh , you can fool some of them by creating upset about guns or gays or abortion or affirmative action , for a while , but eventually they figure it out .
if our politics today has become a choice between big business and big government , you do n't want to make big government more attractive .
but they are doing exactly that .
every time joe says " __name2__ , " __name1__ pays joe $ __quant1__ .
in this post , joe earned $ __quant1__ .
yet you propose massive government intervention to solve what you see as the problem .
and you call yourself a __name1__ .
go figure .
i will admit foreign policy @-@ wise its a push , but domestically ( which most __name1__ care more about ) he is a disaster !
the deficit , true unemployment numbers , the unemployment numbers they pelt on us , __name1__ , __name2__ @/@ __name2__ , refusal of the pipeline , offshore drilling memorandum , stiffing natural gas exploration , gas prices approaching $ __quant1__ __quant2__ gallon , failed stimulus plans , further erosion of our manufacturing base , record food stamps claims , increasing poverty rates , record foreclosure rate , record homes underwater rate and the list goes on and on .
fast and furious !
record days on the golf course ( even more than __name1__ ) .
his wife 's over the top expensive and insulting numerous vacations .
his record overseas is n't as bad as many make it seem , but his record stateside is horrendous !
he is one of the worst economic presidents in history !
i am an __name1__ supporter and people would call as a __name2__ and i am very much against __name3__ 's vision for __name4__ !
that said , a label that is being tossed at __name1__ constantly is that he is antiisrael .
i used to buy it , but now i see it only as propaganda against him .
his actions speak louder than other people 's words !
look at his record : · ( 1 ) __name1__ has n't stopped the military aid and won't even consider it !
( 2 ) __name1__ has n't imposed any sanctions on __name2__ and fights them if presented with them .
( 3 ) he defends __name1__ in every growing __name2__ pandering ( because of the growing muslim population ) and antisemitic __name3__ .
( 4 ) __name1__ has protected __name2__ in the antiisrael __name3__ .
( 5 ) __name1__ has pushed tough sanctions on __name2__ and has taken a strong stance against them .
he has done something __name1__ has done and got __name2__ on board with his policy .
( 6 ) __name1__ stated in __name4__ countries that the bond btw __name2__ and __name3__ is unshakable .
( 7 ) __name1__ has provided funds for the __name2__ .
( 8 ) imports from __name1__ have increased under __name2__ .
( 9 ) __name1__ is killing terrorist and fighting the war on terror with vigor .
( 10 ) he has sold high tech military warplanes to __name1__ and is committed to __name1__ 's military tech edge .
so __name1__ talks bad about the so @-@ called " settlements " ( which is a bullshit argument in the end ) , well in this pc antisemitic world he needs to in order to save face around the world , esp the antisemitic __name2__ , __name3__ and __name4__ .
so he insulted bibi .
bibi seems like an asshole .
he insulted the man not the country .
i am sure there are countries around the globe insulting __name1__ , but are not antiamerican !
he is not bad for __name1__ and he is n't even close to antiisrael .
he is bad for __name1__ and the american economy and that is what we need to care about !
so please stop pelting the __name1__ antiisrael propaganda ! !!
you guys realize that when you have rabid anti @-@ __name2__ rwers with __name2__ @-@ derangement syndrome like ghooks making public statements like this means that the __name1__ is toast this election right ?
i mean , if you have n't noticed , __name1__ 's been systematically removing all possibilities of rw talking points and attacks against him and the left with his presidency .
they can n't call him weak , ask __name1__ and __name2__ ...
and the pirates , they can n't call him anti @-@ __name1__ , for the things just said , they can n't call him anti @-@ guns , we 've never experienced more gun freedom and loose laws concerning them , the list goes on .
thinking __name1__ recognizes this already , and the fold will only grow .
keep up the rabid squeaking and squawking about __name1__ rwers ....
let me know how that works out for you on __month1__ __day1__ .
lol ! !!
the guy views isreal and __name1__ as the problem .
it 's the whole oppressed oppressor thing..
more rhetoric that has some truths , but is mostly a red herring .
he sees the i/p conflict as an important issue that is n't going away .
he wants to solve it !
some of his words and actions have not been in __name1__ 's favor , but overall its well dishonest to characterize him as antiisrael .
he truly believe he is not a full support of capitialism .
he comes from a hippie upbring that says corporations are bad and always out to get you .
he believes in __name1__ @-@ __name2__ ( i do n't think he believes in __name3__ or __name4__ @-@ __name2__ ) and the welfare state .
i think that is a more accurate characterization .
i am a conservative __name1__ who is going to vote for __name2__ this election .
and no , he has n't done jack for the country and i am totally at odds with his liberal __name1__ agenda .
so why would i vote for him and encourage others to pull the lever for __name1__ ?
because after he wins the election he can tell __name1__ to stuff it .
then i believe he will be the __value1__ setting __name1__ to read the riot act to __name2__ and it 's __name3__ government .
not having to worry about re @-@ election will allow __name1__ the freedom to throw off the zionist slave chains that are wrapped around the presidency .
placing __name1__ __value1__ ; and __name2__ a far distance __value2__ .
__name1__ taking this patriotic stance is far more important for our nation 's security and safety than any other single issue or threat we face as a freedom loving people .
voting for a man with so much muslm blood on his hands , sad .
but i agree with ghook , the " __name4__ hates __name5__ and jews " blather is brought to us by the __name2__ and __name3__ type of __name1__ .
the ones who only debate with emotion and hysterics and are n't trying to make a point , just trying to get attention and the " wow " factor .
debt , deficits , __name1__ , garbage economy , plenty of legitimate reasons to hate __name2__ .
no need to drum up emotional diatribe .
the evil __name1__ will never defeat __name2__ chosen people , but that is another topic .
blaming him for debt , deficits or the economy is as bad .
actually ....
i see this adminstaration taking an approach to __name1__ as we should be taking .
for __quant1__ we treated __name1__ like it was the end all .....
sure , they are a great ally ....
but no more important to us than our other allys ...
and on the most part , our other allys respect us ...
and we respect them ...
and that is where it ends ....
we dont treat any of them like they are on a pedestal ...
and we shouldnt with irsrael .
this adnministration is heeding to its responsibilities as an ally of __name1__ , but not putting it on a pedestal .
so what is this adminstratiuon doing ?
treating __name1__ like another ally ...
and nothing more .
i know i know , __name1__ forced him not to make any spending cuts in order to pay for the war and he was powerless to keep the debt from increasing .
also when __name2__ takes a crap , __name1__ cookies come out .
true story .
do n't be silly now !
and thanks for that image .
he did make spending cuts .
but you do n't cut off your nose to spite your face .
i am nore critical of him not protecting __name1__ fron vulture captialism( although a lot of legislation has been blocked ) , signing parts of the unpatriot act and signing __name2__ .
i 'm talking about cuts to the overall budget , we know he 'll never do that , regardless of how much it 'll skyrocket debt and cost our kids and grandkids .
( do n't worry , i know __name1__ will spend us into oblivion also )
and yes i 'm glad you 're critical of him for those things , a sincere kudos to you .
most __name1__ supporters just ignore them .
i 'm not sure you can call me an __name1__ supporter .
there are a few repubicans i would vote for over __name1__ .
of course the only one left is __name1__ , maybe mittens .
i do n't see this as an issue worthy of such hysteria .
__quant1__ . __quant1__ have n't seen any __name1__ hates __name2__ threads in months .
2 . as a regular __name1__ viewer i have n't seen it there in recent months either .
in fact i have n't seen it much at all since __name1__ made the ridiculous border statements .
you are such an uneducated douche bag !
thanks seabiscuit !
hopefully when __name1__ made the exact same border statements in a speech in the __name2__ , you also called them ridiculous .
most __name1__ only freaked out when __name2__ said it .
it would be and is equally stupid no matter who 's mouth it comes out of .
this is actually quite amazing .
being a conservationist i have no problem with green energy projects .
i believe in multiple sources of energy .
on the other hand i do have a problem with taxpayer dollars funding failures on the whims of nutjobs in __name1__ .
earlier this week , __name1__ beneficiary evergreen energy bit the dust .
then , __name1__ , a manufacturer of batteries for electric vehicles and recipient of __name2__ largesse , filed for bankruptcy .
and today , the __name1__ reports that __name2__ , inc . , a manufacturer of solar panels that received $ __quant1__ from the __name3__ , will cut two @-@ thirds of its workforce , about 200 employees , only __quant2__ months after opening a factory in __name4__ .
this is just this week alone .
__value2__ href="http://www.globalwarming.org/2012/01/27/drip-drip-drip-yet-another-green-energy-stimulus-recipient-hits-the-skids-the-third-this-week/"> __value2__ , __value2__ , __value2__ the __value2__ this week ! ) </a>
they still pale to comparison to the $ __quant1__ wasted on __name1__ .
someone needs to go to jail for that one .
damn straight .
what really bothers me about this is that if you study euro models of green energy , they are actually effective and do able ( how do you spell that ) .
the issue is cost effectiveness .
i was watching __quant1__ business program with an awesome finance critic __name1__ and she had gone to __name2__ to interview people who had succeeded in affordable green .
but all i see over here is the government throwing cash at an issue demanding no results .
consequently getting none either .
just that deep flushing sound .
you are right avatar , __name1__ *might* not be lying about wanting an " open marriage " with his __value1__ wife .
however he claimed he had people lined up to back him up and in the end he had no one .
next i assume __name2__ as the religious guy he claims to be got married under __name1__ .
until dead does them apart ...
maybe the vows were different , however i 'm highly doubting it .
in the end __name1__ is a pathological liar , and for him to be right about his second wife i 'd have to take his word against his __value1__ wife ’s...
he did cheat on her and leave her .
__name1__ is not trustworthy on the subject matter of commitment and marriage or on any political position , so he has no credibility .
i ’d take a moldy apples word over __name1__ .
sex , lies and __name1__ .
you sure you 're a conservative ?
that shit is meaningless to me .
i missed the debate but ....
wtf __name1__
you __name1__ are a mess – you ’ve no idea what you want .
you ‘ hate ’ __name1__ and want to ‘ get rid of him ’ but you hate __name2__ , too .
when __name1__ tries to take __name2__ out , you complain about that as well .
some of us know what we want .
this nation would be in better shape now if __name1__ had been elected in __year1__ , and he is my choice now .
edit : i should n't reinforce the assumptions you made about people who oppose __name1__ but they simply do n't apply at all to some of us .
not all of us " hate " __name1__ .
might be , but he really has no reason to be .
he has more than enough money himself .
not sure why he 's trying to pretend he isnt rich .
for middle and liberal support ?
but why would decieving them really get their support ?
i dont understand these politicians .
whats the point of getting " supporters " if you get them dishonestly ?
they turn on you the __value1__ second they realize you are lying
this is why i can n't stand __name1__ haters .
they dislike __quant1__ or maybe two things about __name1__ and it 's allll over with for him ...
then these same people run off and support self declared progressives ( __name1__ and __name2__ ) , then have a fit when it looks like __name3__ supporters might not vote for a morally and politically corrupted person like __name1__ , costing the __name4__ their election .
is __name1__ perfect ?
no… is __name1__ even borderline “ meh ”?
no… is __name1__ really conservative ?
lol , no… maybe with his companies but not with his state .
i appreciate the accomplishments __name1__ had during his term as speaker .
most importantly welfare to work and bringing the __name1__ to power .
working across the isle to create a balanced budget with a surplus .
i also like many of his current ideas .
i do n't like his soaring liberal rhetoric as it relates to __name1__ .
this is the __value1__ rd time i 've answered this question all be it with less detail this time .
please stop asking .
ok , thank you .
as far as i know it was the __value1__ time i have asked you .
i still will say __name1__ might have been *part* of the reason we got a balanced budget but remember newt is a very real *part* __name2__ the reason we got the housing crisis and the doeducation , among other government growth that has helped bankrupt this country .
as a paul fan i see __name1__ 's best __quant1__ minutes of his political life as just another day in __name2__ 's political career .
the housing crisis was set in motion long before __name1__ came along .
as far as the dep __name1__ edu , i do n't know anything about it or its origins .
i 'm watching the post debate coverage and can n't believe my ears , again .
__name1__ railing on __name2__ again about his money .
bitching about romneys investments .
wtf ? !
i want to support __name1__ but he keeps spouting liberal hate lines .
the only one that does n't is __name1__ and __name2__ .
__name1__ won't win and __name2__ , even if he did , is so polarizing that i do n't know if he could beat __name3__ .
__name1__ is so desperate to beat __name2__ that it seems he will stoop to any level , including the anti capitalism liberal lines .
i tell you grampa , my head 's spinning between __name1__ and __name2__ on this bs between them .
i just read a press release , well grab this .
i thought my head was going to explode .
damn this is crazy .
“ it surprises me that __name1__ and his supporters would raise this issue — when mitt by his own admission voted for __name2__ and __name3__ who opposed my father , and later supported liberal __name5__ __name4__ for president .
a direct quote from __name1__ who is so pissed at __name2__ now .
i need some aspirins .
my head hurts from this shit .
pardon my __name1__ .
this link is wild .
has a quote from __name1__ too .
<a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/h/fyye8f9fy0o1/?&v=c&th=1351c179eb8f330b"> https://mail.google.com/mail/h/fyye8...51c179eb8f330b </a>
__name1__ has some explaining to do about things he has said about __name2__ .
better to know these things now than to hear about them after the nomination is settled and __name1__ uses them to make __name2__ look bad .
p.s . , your link did n't work for me , but i used your quote to find this one : <a __name1__ reagan __name2__ limbaugh __name3__ romney </a>
oh agree .
i mean whoever wins we can rejoice that they 've been completely vetted nothing short of a proctology exam by each other
but who knows that might come up too the way it 's freaking going
ps the board won't let me give you any more rep today for your new avatar .
i tried .
what a cutie patootie !
let me know when __name1__ are willing to pay more in taxes to help raise all these unwanted kids if abortion is made illegal .
or does your concern about " life " only extend to the uterus and not when the kid is squirted into the real world and needs parents who will give a crap about them ?
kind of a weak argument given the long waiting list to adopt
not really .
i 've never heard of __name1__ asking for a tax increase to pay for a social program .
how many abortions last year ?
how many families on the adoption waiting list ?
come up with those numbers and you 'll have something .
i already know what they are .
i 'll let you come back and post them and show how wrong i am .
how about that ?
you 'll find you get what you deserve when you say stuff you do n't know to be true or not to me .
millions are estimated as wanting to adopt
all you have just told me is that you do n't know the man at all .
that 's ok , since you would not vote for him .
hyperbole is not logical .
even the __name1__ are not even voting for him : just ask the voters in __name2__ .
have lived in that state , and , he does not have the values of the __name1__ period .
he will just say whatever to get elected .
in fact , i hope he gets elected if __name1__ does not get re @-@ elected .
the __name1__ will just hate him .
and you know this how ?
what 's your source ?
the __year1__ __name1__ found that __quant1__ women were currently seeking to adopt a child .
( freundlich , __year1__ )
__value1__ adoption __value1__ to adopt </a>
that 's not a million is it ?
again , i say , that you will regret saying stuff you do n't know for a fact to be true or not , to me .
mit __name1__ , now that he is running for president , says he is now ‘ pro @-@ life ’ and support the movement – even as a bussinnessman that makes __quant1__ from the __name2__ policy of __quant2__ child per @-@ family .
with mit __name1__ , and the __quant1__ of dollars that come busineess in citizen __name2__ rulling : all have a hand in some way or the other with the __name3__ policy of the ‘ single child policy ’..
that just makes not __quant1__ damn bit of sense .
back to __name1__ that employees half a million citizens of __name2__ : most of the workforce are young women under the age of thirty..
link ?
ilogical lefty nonsense .
yes .
yes he is .
__name1__ has a high unlikablitity quotient in my opinion .
i just do n't think we are going to elect someone we dont ' fundamentally like .
the president has to connect a " warm fuzzy " to people on some level .
__name1__ and __name2__ had a certain rascal type quality .
and , something about __name1__ seems likeable even if you hate his policies .
and , that is something needed to become president .
__name1__ has a " father knows best " aura around him so i do n't think people dislike him .
but , __name1__ comes across as arrogant , mean , and just nasty at times and i do n't think he can over come that with happy talk .
< crickets >
i am feeling very jealous of tm and rdean because they can post a stupid and get __quant1__ instant responses .
come on folks , does n't anyone have anything to say to this ?
your post is intelligently and reasonably stated .
the facts about __name1__ 's foibles are accepted by most reasonable people .
maybe a little long for the likes of tm and rdean , because i would think they would take issue with the thrust of some of the content .
seems you have to flame people to get their attention .
good post baruch .
the double standard allows democrats to ignore what they call " family values " because the __name1__ party does not promote or endorse morality .
it 's a great advantage for a __name2__ candidate to be immune to allegations of improper conduct while accusing __name1__ .
in the great debate over __name1__ and his love life , people keep bringing up the case of clinton .
i believe this to be a case of apples and oranges .
__name1__ was in trouble for suborning perjury in a civil rights case where he was the defendant .
that was also about a blow job , of course .
he insisted one of the workers at the __name1__ give him one and she turned him down and got fired because of that .
however during the __name2__ debate the __name1__ kept going on and on about the blow job .
fundamentally , i think it squicked everyone out to the point they wanted the story over .
plus there was the whole __month1__ -@ __month2__ aspect of monica 's mental maturity and age .
normal people found the whole thing beyond disgusting .
presidential philandering is not new .
and where he sticks his wand can be a matter of national importance .
__name1__ and __name2__ both shared the same girlfriend with __name3__ .
this , had we be wiling to talk about it seriously at the time , would have been legitimate cause for concern .
the face that __name1__ was effectively the wife of __name3__ senator __name2__ also should have got a bit more scrutiny in the run up to the civll __name4__ .
but over the __quant1__ we have sort of thrown a blanket over presidential private lives .
for good or ill .
president __name2__ 's daughter __name1__ was an issue in the campaign , but it did his opponents no good because he was busy discussing tariffs and the depredations of the railroads .
he never did marry __name1__ 's mother .
the relationships between __name1__ and __name2__ and whomever are a matter of titillation but no historical relevance .
__name1__ and __name2__ is ignored again because it is pointless and squicky .
the fact that __name1__ and __name2__ were uxorious did not make them good presidents .
__name1__ 's love for __name2__ did n't solve the __name3__ issue , nor did roselyn 's affection for __name4__ reduce the inflation rate .
__name1__ 's tomcatting did n't make him a failure .
so what does this have to do with __name1__ ?
the basic issues here are trust , intelligence , national security and economic recovery .
__name1__ 's relations with women are at best reprehensible .
if it were a matter of him vs someone equally intelligent and less of a cad i would gleefully go for the other option .
however , there is no drama that he was involved with __name1__ or any other honey pot involved with __name2__ or __name3__ mafias .
he does have lots of really interesting ideas about the economy and the __name1__ 's relations with the rest of the world that are worth listening to .
( but his actual record vis a vis __name1__ and the global warming hoax show he also has pretty bad ideas as well )
so on balance , i have to say that given a choice between __name1__ and __name2__ and __name3__ and his affection for all his weird baggage with __name4__ , global warming , playing footsie with various flaky __name5__ regimes ...
i prefer __name1__ .
but __name1__ 's conjugal craziness is not part of my decision tree .
well said .
__quant1__ for __quant1__ am getting weary of so called " dirt " being dug up on candidates private sexual lives from __quant1__ decade ago let alone many decades ago .
and it 's actually becoming pitiful to watch the political press become __name1__ with old bitter women who have an axe to grind .
__name1__ was n't impeached for sex , but for lying .
he was disbarred for lying .
the bar for __name1__ is pretty low .
what they have to overcome is that even though __name1__ was a world class wife cheater , and a liar , he was still a fairly effective president .
his personal difficulties of keeping his privates in his pants did n't make him a bad president .
there is the __name1__ quandry .
there is nothing weird about it .
it 's the good old double standard .
__name1__ was n't just a philanderer , he was a world class sexual pervert enabled by his wife who is now the secretary of state .
and __name3__ had a string of women going all the way back to __name1__ , when he was governor and then a long relationship with __name2__ and others and all before he was president , i think .
the public knew of these women and so did __name2__ , and __name1__ still became president , and continued with his follies until he was impeached .
i do n't feel that any of his infideliities made him a lesser president .
in fact , i think they helped .
he was a good looking man with power and lust for young beautiful women , and it all worked well for him , until it did n't .
__name1__ is a changed man and i do n't believe he would ever be a serial womanizer .
he has been married since __year1__ to __name1__ , and had a relationship with her for __quant1__ years prior .
it will be interesting to see how it all plays out .
but __name1__ knew this would come up , before he tossed his hat in the ring , and i am sure he will be a better man regardless of how it ends .
i do n't think __name1__ 's sex life is relevant , and i do n't care about __name2__ 's blow job either .
say what you want but the only reason he was even put into the position for lying is that the puritanical neo @-@ cons were chasing down sex rumors ( and spending __quant1__ of taxpayer dollars in the process ) .
and __name1__ was one of them leading the charge .
so when someone says , " it was n't about the blowjob , it was about lying ", it was about the blowjob .
actually , i think your instance on it being the blow job is the it was all about states rights rather than slavery deal .
and hypocrisy in politics is not that big a deal either .
all the efforts and bribes etc etc were to avoid the loss of the civil rights case .
it was n't just the issue of he got a blow job from a dim intern .
it was that you got your job by going down .
do we really want government officials appointed on the casting couch ?
and if you said no , then you were out of a job .
blow job or no job .
and the man was a feminist icon .
what kind of feminism is that that promotes that kind of employment ' opportunity .
if you can swallow that it was ' just a blow job ' than you swallow everything .
now , fellatio aside , did __name1__ 's tomcatting gett in the way of his job ?
by all accounts , he was good at multitasking .
is this really all that relavent to his job performance ?
now if you could find proof that he was sleeping with someone from the __name1__ or the __name2__ , that would be interesting sexual exchanges .
or that he was sleeping with lobbyist as payment for legislation , that would be interesting and worthwhile to discuss .
the cons can say what they want but yes , it was about the blowjob .
and now they want to turn a blind eye to __name1__ 's philandering and desire for an open marriage ?
pure hypocrisy .
telling yourself that it was about the blow job allows you to howl hypocrisy .
facing the truth of the matter , that he treated women like dirt and that if a woman had the courage to say no to him she had better shop the resume is beyond you .
but we still face the question of what is more important to us as citizens .
voting for incompetent and uxorious like __name2__ and __name1__ , or voting for comptent slime like __name3__ and __name4__ .
i 'm in a bit of a quandary on this one .
fundamentally , everyone is entitled to a private life and - no matter who they are - they have a right not to have their personal life dragged through the mud for political point scoring or for the general consumption of the public .
having said that , i do feel that ...
if __quant1__ is capable of treating one 's own family so badly , or one breaks the vows of marriage ...
then why should i trust that person to take their oath of office seriously ?
if people cheat on their life partner , they are unlikely to treat anyone else any better .
and for me is that __quant2__ could not care less if a man has a girlfriend on the side or __quant1__ girlfriends ( or even boyfriends ) on the side .
i never did care .
none of that , to me , translates into his ability to do the right things in office and it never has .
but for years all we ever heard about was __name1__ 's morals and now it seems that all of the sudden morals do n't matter .
there 's a lot of inconsistency on this one and i have no problem pointing it out .
obviously to the voters it did n't matter .
fully aware of __name1__ millions voted for him anyway .
if you want to play this game , if it did n't matter than , it does n't matter now .
you can n't play the game of " i did n't think it mattered then , but now i do ."
so you think everyone just lies to you or that we are all just so confused we cant fathom what our reasons are for wanting __name1__ impeached ?
lol
yeah , its a classic libtard dodge , isnt it ?
make up what you think your opponents *really* mean and then slam them for it .
we critisize __name1__ for being a philanderer who used his power to get sex and the libtards just assume that we really dont have a problem with that but it *must* be something else .
wonder why that is ?
the fact is that some of the best leaders throughout history have been philandering drunkards .
when you need a leader , you can be forgiven for over @-@ looking a few things .
rape isnt one of them .
so , i guess the population of divorced people should n't qualify for office .
after all , they could n't keep their vows for life .
this is the type of politics __name1__ , himself , founded .
he 's got a huge set of balls to complain about it now .
seriously .
well said .......
you must spread some reputation around before giving it to sallow again .
soooooo ..........
first of all it was about the blowjob .
then it was about the lying .
now what is it ?
lying about the blowjob .
denying that is like a redneck denying the __name1__ was about slavery .
not to change the subject ; but the __name1__ was about " states rights " and not slavery .
the states ' right to have slaves .
it 's in each and every one of the confederate states ' constitutions .
problem is __name1__ did something no other president did , he violated the oval office by having sex thaere and then lying about it .
you did not mention that why ?
problem no.2 , people want to hang __name2__ out to dry but still kiss old __name1__ behind .
ok .....
now we 're back to the blowjob again .
i wish you bastards would make up your mind .
actually it was about states rights to have slavery .
slavery was the reason the states wanted to have states rights .
" founded "?
you really think he pioneered this kind of politics ?
history as taught and learned by the left wing propagandists will likely be kind to president __name1__ .
but if they were honest and objective , they would n't be .
this is part of why stooges like you cannot see even a glimmer of reality .
so you agree that if only __value1__ % of what hacks like you say were true then our wonderful country would have folded in __year1__ ?
or did i confuse you with someone with a different critical thinking skill set ?
no , moron .
unlike idiots like you , i do n't subscribe to the positively retarded notion that those who disagree with chumps like you are " hacks ."
i read the drivel bullshit spew you posted .
ergo , it is clear that it is you who are the hack .
and no.
the country did well in terms of setting the foundation for what has lasted so far almost __quant1__ years because they subscribed to the things i believe and those whom morons like you consider " hacks " believe .
you would n't recognize a critical thinking skill set , ya dickweed .
you 'd have to be able to think on your own .
clearly , you can n't .
my , my . this is a positive thread about the prez as some here said never happens and bam , the idiots show up and try and make it about themselves and how they view their perceived terribleness of ' murica .
for shame , for shame .
like i said earlier , if only __value1__ % of the horseshit you rightwing bitches said were true then our wonderful country would have folded like a cheap suit in or about __year1__ .
i sometimes wonder if when __name1__ and __name2__ took over __name3__ and spent most of their time investigating and undermining __name4__ that they also purposefully took their eye 's off the ball and the growing economic problems of the country .
how could they miss the inevitable housing bubble that most __name1__ suspected all along , given that they were directly responsible and had the inside scoop for instance ?
__name1__ warned them several times but they refused to act ...
mmm
if __name1__ and __name2__ had actually investigated gwb as you claim and i wished then he and many of his administration and other war criminals would now be in prison .
another oddity with __name1__ & __name2__ is the unemployment figures , after __quant1__ year of __name3__ control and the last of the __name4__ budgets past away , the unemployment figures started growing precipitously .
i suppose it 's against the rules for __name1__ to question these things ...
i understand just blaming __name1__ is the simplest of answers , no thought required ...
ergo the obama/democrat/ liberal press excuses ...
had it been any one of those other palookas , say , cain'n'palin the country would have been in shambles .
__name1__ has pulled the country back from the brink of disaster that bush'n'cheney had left it in .
he 's created __name2__ , because , as we all know , __name1__ cares .
he 's brought dignity back to the office .
the economy has been steadily ticking up .
he saved gm ...
a whopping success .
he got __name1__ from a place that __name2__ did n't dare to go into .
__name1__ 's gone .
pirates of the seas know they can n't ' eff around with __name1__ or any of their properties .
he helped to liberate a country from a tyrant w/o spending too much time , money and with no casualties .
the rest of the world knows the same .
although he 's not going around screaming about how big'n'tuff ' murrka is .
he 's pulling us out of war .
and , once again , the economy continues to tick up , despite his opponents in the __name1__ 's efforts to undermine him at every .
single .
turn .
yeah ...
i 'd say __name1__ 's a shoe @-@ in for the next election .
not to mention , history is going to be very kind to __name1__ ...
unlike the last guy .
so your standards are still pretty low ?
next chance you get , look in the mirror and repeat this 100 times ...
" i need to stop getting my info from __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ & __name4__ "...
they did a lot , too .
__name1__ and __name2__ , but right now this thread is about the tremendous attributes of the current potus __name3__ .
take your whine to another thread that might offer more cheese to your mousey mouth .
and oh by the way..
over __name1__ 's __quant1__ years of the presidency he saved well over 200 million jobs .
i figure my guess is at least as reputable as the __name1__ 's toadies..
the idiots , dope , are the obamawannablowhim tube steaks , like you , who see no wrong in that imbecile .
as president , he sucks .
it is because of leftwing goobers like you that we are in danger of losing our republic .
adherents of the system crafted for us by the framers and the founders -- that is , the conservatives -- are the bulwark against the idiocy of schmucks , like you , who would have cost us the republic by now if you had been given your desires .
i have a history of giving due credit to president __name1__ for the few things he has done right .
assholes such as you are utterly unable to admit how bad he is , however , in light of all he has done so terribly .
you are laughable .
and you smell like a sock .
i think of you , nowadays , as a brother , marc !
but you 're kinda like the crazy uncle .
president __name1__ is doing a bang up job .
you funny !
hehehe ...
c'mon...
you know i 'm right .
say it .
the worst economic recovery since the __name1__
the record of president __name1__ ’s __value1__ __quant1__ years in office is in , and nothing that happens now can go back and change that .
what that record shows is that president __name1__ , with his throwback , old @-@ fashioned , __decade1__ s __name4__ economics , has put __name2__ through the worst recovery from a recession since the __name3__ .
the recession started in __month1__ , __year1__ .
go to the website of the __name1__ ( <a href="http://www.nber.org"> __name1__ research </a> ) to see the complete history __name2__ america ’s recessions .
what that history reveals is that before this last recession , since the __name2__ recessions in __name1__ have lasted an average of __quant2__ months , with the longest previously lasting __quant1__ months .
when president __name1__ entered office in __month1__ , __year1__ , the recession was already in its __value1__ th month .
his responsibility was to manage a timely , robust recovery to get __name1__ back on track again .
based on the historical record , that recovery was imminent , within a couple of months or so .
despite widespread fear , nothing fundamental had changed to deprive __name1__ of the long term , world @-@ leading prosperity it had enjoyed going back __quant1__ years .
supposedly a forward looking progressive , __name1__ proved to be __name2__ ’s __value1__ backward looking regressive .
his __value1__ act was to increase federal borrowing , the national debt and the deficit by nearly a trillion dollars to finance a supposed “ stimulus ” package , based on the discredited __name1__ theory left for dead __quant1__ years ago holding that increased government spending , deficits and debt are what promote economic growth and recovery .
that theory arose in the __decade1__ s as the answer to the __name1__ , which , of course , never worked .
that was the beginning of president __name1__ ’s rip van winkle act , pretending not to know anything that happened over the previous __quant1__ years proving the dramatic , historic success of the new , more modern , supply side economics , which holds that incentives for increased production are what promote economic growth and recovery .
indeed , that rip van winklism pretended not to remember the __decade1__ s either , when double digit inflation and double digit unemployment proved __name1__ economics grievously wrong .
as should have been long expected , obama ’s trillion dollar __name1__ stimulus did nothing to promote recovery and growth , and almost surely delayed it .
that is because borrowing a __quant1__ dollars out of the economy to spend a trillion back into it does nothing to promote the economy on net .
indeed , it is probably a net drag on the economy , because the private sector spends the money more productively and efficiently than the public sector .
the __name1__ scored the recession as ending in __month1__ , __year1__ .
yet , today , in the __value1__ th month since the recession started , there has still been no real recovery , like recoveries from previous recessions in __name1__ .
unemployment actually rose after __month1__ , __year1__ , and did not fall back down below that level until __quant1__ months later in __month2__ , __year2__ .
instead of a recovery , __name1__ has suffered the longest period of unemployment near __value1__ % or above since the __name2__ , under president __name3__ ’s public policy malpractice .
even today , __quant1__ months after the recession started , the u6 unemployment rate counting the unemployed , underemployed and discouraged workers is still __value1__ % .
and that does n’t include all the workers who have fled the workforce under __name1__ ’s economic oppression .
the unemployment rate with the full measure of discouraged workers is reported at <a href="http://www.shadowstats.com"> shadow government statistics : home page </a> as __value1__ 23 % , which is depression level unemployment .
today , over __quant1__ years since the recession started , there are still almost 25 million __name1__ unemployed or underemployed .
that includes 5.6 million who are long @-@ term unemployed for __quant1__ weeks , or more than __quant2__ months .

black unemployment has been over __value1__ % for 2 ½ years under __name1__ .
black teenage unemployment today is over __value1__ % , where it has persisted for over __quant1__ years as well .

well..
i 'm crushed ....
but hardly surprised ...
sorry , liar , but the case that was brought and won against the nbp was dismissed by the direct orders of the racist __name1__ .
the bush administration ’s justice department — not the __name1__ administration — made the decision not to pursue criminal charges against members of the __name2__ for alleged voter intimidation at a polling center in __name3__ in __year1__
you mad ?
nope , sorry , liar ...
you a dumbass ...
the __name2__ __name1__ seal bears a __name3__ phrase : " qui pro domina justitia sequitur ."
the motto refers to the attorney general , " who prosecutes on behalf of lady justice ."
but under president __name2__ 's politically corrupt __name1__ , lady justice is getting the shaft .
to wit : let 's examine the uproar over attorney general __name1__ 's decision to protect hate @-@ mongering thugs who harassed and bullied precinct workers and voters on __name2__ in __name3__ .
oh , wait .
there 's been no uproar .
let me tell you why .
__quant3__ weeks ago , in a highly unusual move , __name1__ dismissed default judgments his department had won against __quant1__ of __quant2__ defendants charged with violating the __name2__ .
on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ , a billy club @-@ wielding militant in military @-@ style boots and beret stood outside a __name1__ polling location with a similarly dressed partner .

we have it figured out perfectly now
i guess if you ignore the fact that he can n't submit budgets ...
is the __value1__ __name1__ president to have our credit rating downgraded ...
ran up more debt in a shorter amount of time than anyone in history ...
has a " signature " piece of legislation , obamacare , that not only does n't lower health __name1__ cost but is probably the most badly written law ever and will be ruled unconstitutional ...
appointed the same man who got __name1__ off for a lump sum payment to the clintons as his attorney general ...
appointed a man who could n't figure out turbotax as our __name1__ secretary ...
fast tracked __name1__ and made it the " showcase " of his green jobs initiative ...
spent a __quant1__ dollars on his " stimulus " only to see unemployment go from __value1__ % to over __value2__ ...
stonewalled drilling permits in the __name1__ and the oil pipeline to placate his environmental base while throwing __quant1__ of jobless americans under the bus ...
gave us expensive programs like __name1__ that ate up __quant1__ of taxpayer dollars and did n't jumpstart the economy ...
has deteriorated our relationship with __name1__ to it 's worst state ever while he tried to " reason " with __name2__ ...
has no coherent energy policy ...
no coherent housing policy ...
no coherent trade policy ...
has shown absolutely no ability to forge a bipartisan approach to governing ...

yeah .
you pretty much stunk up the place with that one , dave .
you really take criticism of dear reader personally , do n't you ?
another one that 's been around the internet several times .
c'mon dave , if you 've gotta be combative on message boards , at least be funny about it .
i must have missed the part in the tos where i 'm supposed to entertain people whose idea of humor is a __name1__ mustache on a picture of __name2__ .
it 's coolest to be submissive dave , do n't question __name1__ authority..
they are right without question..
ask any liberal/dem...
silly me .
i 'm kinda used to being a citizen .
not real interested in being a subject .
no , no , hell no.
__name1__ and other progressively oriented voters are correct without question .
that is an observable , measurable and well documented fact .
live with it or go find you a rightwing country where you might proliferate yourself a bit better .
this country was founded on tolerance , diversity , charity , education , the betterment of a desperate but faithful and patriotic society and all other considerations now referred to as liberal @-@ isms .
we are certainly a far better country and society than what i see mostly posting around here condemning everything from the president to the smell of their own farts .
you turnip green eating sonofabitches need to get some lessons on __name1__ history and foundational principles .
interesting version of " tolerance ": " immediately and unquestioningly agree with everything i say or get out ! !"
please tell me you do n't vote -- or breed .
what do you expect from someone who has a picture of a big , dumb looking guy as an avatar ?
that 's the best you got ?
pathetic .
just reading about __name1__ bringing dignity back to the office of president was enough to discredit the whole thing .
__name1__ let ' em go
you mad ?
you wrong .

bang up ?
i guess you 're kinda right ....
the __name1__ is basically imploding .
does that mean we are supposed to swallow rotten tripe just because someone is using it to say something nice about the president/ if i posted a thread talking about how wonderful it is that __name1__ got __name2__ would you let it go simply because it is positive , or would you call me for distorting facts ?
do you actually have a brain ?
this one here gets me ...
lets see , __name1__ had __name2__ @/@ __name2__ to deal with but yet it 's the __name3__ who history is going to bestow sainthood on..
that what i 'm talking about obamabots and jonestown..
you know why steffyweffie ...
because __name1__ chose to squander it .
he had the entire country behind him right after __name1__ @/@ __name1__ , the right , the left , and the center .
howevr , __name1__ chose to dismantle the __name2__ and institute his own demented far rw and totalitarian policies .
there were no weapons of mass destruction .
__name1__ had nothing to do with __name2__ @/@ __name2__ .
neither did __name1__ .
he chose to keep the country in a constant state of fear to blunt their thinking .
he bullied the press , for which i blame mostly the press for for not pushing back .
he eroded our freedoms .
all the things you guys claim to be so pissed at __name1__ for ...
were instituted under __name1__ .
i did n't even mention tortured people .
__name1__ was and is an unmitigated .
royal .
disaster .
history will bare that out .
holy smoke , you should sit here and preach about __name1__ dismantling the __name2__ ...
do you say that about the dear leader today ?
everyone else thinks so but you __value1__ % who still approve of him ...
so lets get real dear..
__name1__ instituted it sweetheart ...
what did you , or do you think about that ?
he started the dismantling of the __name1__ .
what say you ?
and __name1__ 's continuing it .
but do n't you dare criticize dear reader .
where 's your criticism of shrub twinkle toes ?
i 've criticized him many times , for not wielding his veto pen nearly enough , for not fighting the wars in __name1__ and __name2__ aggressively enough , and for spending money like a drunken __name3__ .
where 's your criticism of scoamf ?
if bush started it how do you explain __name1__ bombing __name2__ if __name3__ was the __value1__ president to ignore the __name4__ ?
i was pretty pissed he did n't put up __name1__ , he did n't fight hard enough for health care reform .
i think he gave and gives the __name1__ too much leeway , in other words he does n't fight then nearly enough .
he agrees with them too much .
he did n't shut down __name1__ .
however , i temper that with the realization that said __name1__ are fighting him tooth and nail on everything .
awww poor poor __name2__ , those meanie __name1__ are standing in your way of greatness..

turned __name1__ from a deficit spending president in a fortunate economy to a budget surplus and __name2__ pro @-@ sexual harassment hero..
soo..
what 's your beef with this guy ... ?
i have no beef with him .
at least he told the truth and said that the budget was balanced during __name1__ 's presidency .
__name1__ never balanced the budget .
the only thing he balanced was interns .
and who forced it ?
it was n't clinton .
yup..
__name1__ went along with it kicking and screaming but then experienced that typical __name2__ long term @/@ short term memory loss and took full credit..
you know what i love about nutters ?
they are not hypocitical at all .
they are always consistent ....
always .
yeah , i think __name1__ should win the primary .
no really .
wait .
where 's your copy paste on this issue ?
indeed ...
and in his re @-@ election bid ?
__name1__ was forced to do the potamic __quant1__ @-@ step electric slide to the center like a good politician .
wha ....
you learned to read ? ???
my main beef is his hypocrisy going after __name1__ for an affair .
i do n't trust him to put the nation before politics .
i have no rep left but i have __quant1__ vote .
and __name1__ will get it .
wut ?
do you really believe that is what prompted the investigation ?
do n't have one .
he 's already my choice , assuming he 's still in by the time my state 's primary rolls around .
in the primary my vote will go to __name1__ .
that is who i think that can kick __name1__ 's ass in a debate and an election
more importantly ( if not more urgently ) , i think his plans for getting our country out of the mess it 's in are really good .
i did n't realize __name1__ was impeached for adultery ?
i thought it was because he lied to a grand jury and used his office to influence others to lie ?
amazing what you can learn on the internet
technically , you are right .
practically , nobody cared .
because every man in this country would have told the exact same lie if asked .
people forgave __name1__ for the lying because the question never should have been asked in the first place .
just like they thought the " hi @-@ tech " lynching of __name1__ was wrong __quant1__ years earlier .
interrogating people about their sex lives isnt ' kosher to a lot of people .
now , in the interest of complete fairness , __name1__ brought most of his troubles down on himself .
he should have settled with __name1__ __quant1__ earlier .
and he got a whole lot of millage out of sexual harrassment bs at the time of the __name1__ hearings .
but all the real damage was done when __name1__ 's name came out .
by pressing the issue , the __name1__ made themselves look bad .
i find it interesting that you probscribe your personal values to " practically " everybody .
i would suggest that a few more than " nobody " cared .
using executive privelege to lure women into sexual relationships is at best , sleazy ...
at worst , corrupt .
maybe a few of the problems in this country are caused by people who give a pass to the sleazy and corrupt ?
if a bj was the biggest concern of the nation with the president right now @-@ the whole country would be a lot better .
i mean seriously __name1__ was 100x better than __name2__ and __name3__ .
you 're also very naive if you think any modern president isn't/wasn't corrupt .
they all are @/@ were on some level .
ps @-@ nice icon !
\m/
back to my boy , __name1__ .
i love hearing him talk in these debates .
he makes the other candidates sound like a bunch of kids squabbling over the last popsicle .
check out the way __name1__ discussed __name2__ 's 999 plan .
he started by commending and complimenting cain , and then raised objections to the plan without once denigrating __name1__ , or even sounding like he was denigrating the plan .
he sounds so statesmanlike .
i 've been following his website postings about the legislation he would propose as president .
it 's really good , and quite innovative in places .
and i like his plan for his __value1__ executive order as president to be abolishing all " czars " in the federal government .
you like intelligence and a president who speaks in full sentences ?
we agree .
but .....
then you say you like the plan to abolish czars .
do n't you know that this is just a piece of grandstanding nonsense ?
you like intelligence and good speaking ?
i had n't noticed , given your election of __name1__ .
what i know about abolishing the czars is that they 're unconstitutional and have no business having power in our federal government , and thus , i know that it 's an excellent idea to return that power to the people duly elected or appointed in accordance with law .
but as i mentioned earlier , i realize that laws are just suggestions to be ignored at will to leftists , so i do n't expect you to understand why they 're so important to the rest of us .

when " the best debater " and " most informed candidate " can n't even convince his own campaign manager and spokesman to stay with his campaign at this early date - then something is definitely wrong !
when a mass exodus of staffers makes a presidential candidate feel " liberated " - then someone is out of touch with reality and my money is on the __name1__ !
huffington post ?
puhleeze .
i would have explained what happened to you if you had n't proven yourself to be a braindead twink who 's incapable of finding the truth , let alone comprehending it .
dismissed .
move along .
in addition to the adultery ?
__name1__ is one of those guys who says he loves __name2__ but seems to hate americans .
in the __year1__ 's there was a news story about a woman whose baby was cut out of her belly .
the rest of us were recoiling at the horror of people , individuals , who could do that .
__name1__ was pontificating about the seething underbelly of the welfare society .
__name1__ has no heart .
he has a brain and a weenie .
and the weenie obviously overrules the brain more often than it should .
at least that 's how he comes across often , and that 's baggage .
i 'm not his wife , and i 'm not looking to date him , so i really do n't consider his marital relationships , past or present , to be any of my business .
and i really do n't think now is the time to be quibbling about trivial bullshit .
our nation is in trouble , and to be blunt , i think anyone who 's worried about " he 's not a very nice or likable guy " at a time like this deserves to have their nation fall apart around them .
now , show me evidence that __name1__ violated the law , a la former president horndog , and we 'll talk .
you 're pointing at the marital infidelity side of the equation and poopooing us holding that against him .
__name1__ do n't get to poopoo that .
we 've let the religious right carry the torch for us for so long that we are the preacher party .
__name1__ can cheat and not destroy their party .
but if we cheat , we 're hypocrites .
you might not think it 's fair or smart , but that 's how it is .
__name1__ burned his morality card and that 's baggage .
but for me it 's way more than the adultery .
it 's his hatefulness and lack of empathy .
that 's more than not being " likable ".
when a woman is murdered in a heinous way , you give condolences to her family .
you do n't start hurling around bullshit about the welfare state .
back during the __name1__ mosque upheaval he said something else which showed me that he had n't learned his lesson , and which can be held against him in soundbites and on a deeper level .
i do n't remember the details and am not going to look it up at this time .
i do n't need to now because he 's not a contender so i do n't have to worry about him .
__name1__ burnt his bridges with me long ago and i 'm glad he 's not a contender now .
what makes you think i 'm a __name1__ ?
furthermore , please refer back to what i said earlier : if you 're worried about his personality at a time like this , you deserve to have your country fall apart around you .
you asked about baggage .
you do n't get to define the terms about what should or should not be baggage and say " we 'll talk " as if your terms make the baggage no more .
baggage is , whether you think it is logical or not .
and __name1__ has it .
yes , because there are a lot of shallow halfwits in this country who 've been weaned on __name1__ and now do n't seem to know how to differentiate between politicians and celebrities and set priorities when it comes to elections .
i do n't get to tell you what inane bullshit you can or can n't value over little things like issues , positions , and plans , but i sure as hell do get to tell you that your " baggage " is a load of crap if that 's what i think .
and i do .
so again , feel free to vote for the person who seems warm and fuzzy to you , but do n't even consider coming in here and bitching about the problems in this country afterward .
your response is going to be , " but i 'm sure he sends his condolences for your suffering , and that 's all you cared about , is n't it ? "
myself , i 'd rather have a coldhearted bastard who can fix our problems than a nice , likable person who sympathizes with them .
you asked about the baggage .
i noted some of it .
you can deny it all you want , but it exists .
__name1__ is not a viable candidate .
that 's the bottom line .
i can n't believe that the truth is so new to you , cecille .

the week ?
muckraker ?
his ex @-@ wife ? !
thanks for proving my point about you being an ignorant shitstain too lazy to think and separate rumor from reality .
because every intelligent person looks to a man 's ex @-@ wife for " the truth " about him .
sure they do .
sit down and shut the fuck up before you humiliate yourself further , fucktard .
well , i 'm sure he would n't get the ignorant shitstain vote .
on the other hand , i do n't think he wants it .
denial is not just a river in __name1__ .
that 's not just from the ex @-@ wife .
it 's from people who worked with him .
__name1__ has admitted to most of what you would deny .
and he came up with a wacky excuse for it .
he just loved the country too much .
__name1__ is not stable .
his personal life aside--that is only fair since apparently only __name1__ are fair game to have their personal lives closely scrutinized and criticized--newt is by far the best educated , has the highest iq , and the most impressive knowledge , recall ability , and vision of any of the candidates running this year .
in his professional life he has pulled __quant1__ major blunders .
__value1__ was in taking on the dishonest and corrupt __name1__ and forcing his resignation over a book deal in the __name2__ administration and then writing his own book which of course triggered the same kinds of accusations .
hypocrisy is allowed on the left , but is not to be tolerated on the right .
the __value1__ was the same sort of thing when he imprudently forced the impeachment of president __name1__ on grounds that most of us did n't think rose the the level of high crimes and misdemeanors .
those grounds had nothing to do with __name1__ , but the left , having a less sophisticated constituency , was able to make it look like it did and then could trash __name2__ from engaging in his own infidelity .
more hypocrisy that is allowed on the left , but is not to be tolerated on the right .
can __name1__ live down that kind of baggage in a head to head contest with __name2__ ?
given that the msm will play up all of __name1__ 's baggage while continuing to ignore __name2__ 's , i do n't know .
__name1__ right now is not my favorite of the candidates , but __quant1__ would n't have to hold my nose to vote for him __quant1__ year from __month1__ , and he would be heads and shoulders above the current occupant of the __name2__ .
he 's also just about as big a bigot and racist as __name1__ .
who 's also very smart and savvy .
you really believe that the impeachment was on solid ground ?
no.
as i said __name1__ was absolutely guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice to the detriment of a private citizen and that is indefensible and was enough to get him suspended from the bar in the __name2__ , in __name3__ , and charged with contempt of court in __name4__ .
but it did not , in my opinion , rise to the level of high crimes and misdemeanors that justified impeachment .
the __name1__ seemed to be of that same opinion as , even though __name2__ controlled , chose not to convict him and force him out of office .
yeah..
like you guys really care about that shit .
both __name1__ and __name2__ " perjured " themselves in much bigger ways..
people got killed .
i 'm sure in your mind he is sallow .
most leftists buy into all the hate stuff put out there on somebody like __name1__ .
i have not seen any bigotry or racism in __name1__ however , nor in __name2__ for that matter--buchanan has been right on the edge of anti @-@ semitism a time or two however--but both have focused mostly on the truth of the human condition which , to the left , is not allowed in our politically correct world .
clintons transgressions appear to be forgiven by the left .
aw whats a little obstruction of justice and perjury .
jeeze the guy was only a sitting potus .
as for __name1__ well lets get out the tar and feathers .
__name1__ the smartest guy in the room and is way more competant that the joker sitting in the oval office right now .
of course i would be very surprised if the got the nomination even though he is way more than able .
pb is not on the edge , he 's a white supremacist .
__name1__ 's just an opportunistic asshole .
oh gosh , really ?
and you write for a newspaper or something like that ?
bigotry is holding that one 's culture or religion is superior to others and racism is holding that one 's race is superior to others .
both __name1__ and __name2__ have commented and wrote about the superiority of the __name3__ , christainity and the white race .
__name1__ is your friend .
what " transgressions "?
__name1__ got a blowjob .
that 's it .
__name1__ made a deal with __name2__ to get elected and funded terrorists that raped and killed __name3__ nuns .
__name1__ lied about __name2__ .
and completely lied about it .
killed thousands .
those are real transgression .
nothing will happen to either man .
i am aware of the slant that people like you put on it .
i have also read what both have written on the subject .
and your take is mean spirited and based on the leftist political correct notion that the white race or the american @/@ european culture is never to be recognized for any accomplishments and anyone who presumes to do so shall be branded white supremacist and @/@ or racist .
ability to analyze content critically , reading comprehension , and honest critique would be your friend if you would allow it to be .
there 's nothing wrong with regonizing the accomplishments of cultures .
absolutely nothing .
but when you start saying they are superior to others..
you get into some really dodgy terroritory .
please take your own advice .
i 'm not viewing pb with any slant .
i 'm reading what he says .
he 's a racist and anti @-@ semite .
he says we should have sided with __name1__ .
he questions the __name1__ .
he says that we need white people in power or the culture will fall .
as for pc , you 're setting up a straw man .
your claim is not even close to mainstream liberal , left , or democratic rhetoric .
i challenge you to prove that with any quotation in context from either of them .

do n't know about you but i expect a bit more from the supreme leader of __name1__ .
as for his blowjob ?
i could care if he blew every intern in __name1__ .
clintons morals or lack thereof do n't bother me __quant1__ bit .
just as __name1__ do n't .
clintons not the __value1__ prez nor will he be the last to chase skirts .
or blowjobs .

legally .
yes .
__name1__ broke several federal statues .
people have gone to prison and lost their jobs for a lot less .
politically .
not so much .
he was still popular and the country was willing to forgive him and frankly , his being acquitted was a forgone conclusion .
if he had __name1__ 's economic numbers , he 'd have been run out on a rail .
the millage that could have been gotten out of it was gotten when __name1__ nailed down that he lied .
they should have censured him and left it at that .
oh gosh .
but i agree with your conclusion .
no , you made the accusation that the quotes are racist or bigoted .
so you put them into context and justify your opinion that they are racist or bigoted .
sallow did not do that with the highly biased and bigoted links he posted .
they are in context .
[ · exactly .
sexual harrassment lawsuits from malingerers cost $$$$.
that 's part of the equation .
glad you are finally getting it , i was beginning to think you were stupid .
oh , give it up .
they go for very cheap labor .
yeah , i 'm sure that includes getting sexual favors for free from workers , but that 's just a bonus .
you can go there and accuse all the women you like of putting pubic hairs on your coke can , and then carry on about how they should grow up .
but she got __quant1__ after she stuck the knife in . amazing .
are you gifting her with psychic abilities ?
all she got at the time was trouble and humiliation , and the possible permanent loss of employment in her chosen field .
she took the risk because she had no choice .
and somehow , you put that on her .
which is crazy .
then they should stop whining about it .
actually , no one believes them because they usually end up suing for bullshit .
frankly , never saw a sh case brought that was n't complete bs , but good people got fired for petty bs because hr departments are running scared .
true , they later find ways of getting rid of the malingerers , because that 's just a bomb waiting to go off .
you poor thing .
being that you were completely wrong on the last __quant1__ , and wrong on hill being a · again , you ignored the issue .
__name1__ called his grandmother a racist on national tv because he could n't bring himself to denounce the nasty , anti @-@ __name2__ racist bile pouring out of the mouth of his pastor .
the woman who raised him when his parents could n't be bothered .
seems a lot worse than getting divorces from marriages that are n't working to me .
absolutely not .
__name1__ made a point that went way over your head .
the point that we all have racial bias that slips through at times .
all of us .
every one of us .
to be a racist is a far more concentrated effort .
joe , the links about __name1__ are in an earlier thread .
read them .
you 'll find out about the child support , and the tendency to dump wives when they get sick , and the serial adultery .
but you 're right , the __value1__ wife was a lobbyist .
now go read the rest .
thanks .
well , i did .
far left kook websites letting an jilted ex @-@ wife break bad do n't count .
and you did get the facts wrong about so many other things ....
and you got one wrong again ( bolded )> __name1__ is the __value2__ wife , not the __value1__ ...
again , do you bother to do any research before wasting my valuable time ?
get your facts right before you shoot off your mouth .
no.
he did n't violate federal statues .
everyone lies about cheating when their wife is in the room .
__name1__ spent __quant1__ of our tax money for a blue dress .
and __name1__ across the country are wasting __quant1__ upon __quant1__ enacting laws that they know are not constitutional and will get struck down , like drug testing in order to get assistance , and voter disenfranchisement .
wingnuts love to waste taxpayer money .
can n't blame __name1__ .
he did exactly what the ic statue is designed to do .
keep investigating until you get someone for something .
that 's why it was an awful law when designed , because it created guys like __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , fanatics redoubling their efforts while losing sight of their goals .
and the federal perjury statues do not have a " you can lie if your wife is in the room and will brain you with an ashtray when you get home " exception .
which is exactly the beauty of sexual harrassment lawsuits .
you can be totally innocent of whatever you are accused of , but they can drag in every ex @-@ girlfriend , co @-@ worker , casual acquaintance etc , and who knows what you 'll have to answer for ?
which is why most companies fire the accused without hearing and settle .
then fire the accuser if she does n't have the good sense to move on .
so , __name1__ was a fanatic who lost sight of his goals , but we can n't blame him ?
perhaps you 'd like to show me where __name1__ admitted to anything other than having an affair on his __value1__ wife .
see if you can do it using real news sources , rather than blogs .
amazingly enough , just because someone says it on the internet , that does n't make it true .
that 's cool .
i just hope every __name1__ feels that way .
oh , i 'm pretty sure most __name1__ do n't want the ignorant shitstain vote .
and , after all , we 're pretty used to you voting __name1__ , anyway .
of course , what you won't find is any sort of real source that anyone who is n't a __quant1__ @-@ toothed , __name1__ @-@ listening moron would waste time reading , let alone believing and citing to other people as though it means something .
i 'm just waiting for this deliverance reject to quote us __name1__ .
what you find contemptible about her is that she accused a __name1__ .
no , what i find contemptable is that she used this guy to advance herself , and then stabbed him in the back when that was advantageous .
it lacks honor and decency .
that goes beyond partisanship .
ask some of the rw people about me .
half of them think i 'm a liberal because i do n't toe the idealogical line .
i 'm just as critical of __name1__ and __name2__ @- when they deserve it .
no , and neither do you .
the comparison is stupid , and again , you 're crediting her with psychic abilities , along with the ability to make herself get subpoenaed .
well , if she said , " clarance , great guy " like everyone else who was asked about judge __name1__ by the __name2__ , she would n't have gotten supeoned .
instead she said , " ummm , he said something bad once , what a bad guy ...
you are n't going to put my name to this , are you ?
i might need another letter of recommendation ."
__name1__ helped the nation .
got our hostages out , helped defeat the __name1__ ...
are you kidding ?
the problem is that __name1__ keep crapping on the nation , so we have to have special prosecutors to slow them down .
then they get angry over being investigated so they investigate a land deal and a blow job for revenge .
actually , going back to your psychic powers bullshit , how did those mean old republcans actually make __name1__ lie ?
here 's how __name1__ could have avoided problems .
" did you get a blow job from __name1__ ".
" yeah ."
problem solved .
now , __name1__ might have brained him with an ashtray , but he would n't have been in legal trouble .
or better yet , he could have settled with jones when she was only asking for a third of what she eventually got and an apology .
please be logical .
the __name1__ says that she was covert .
you are acting as if because no one could be convicted , she becomes non @-@ covert .
__name1__ was a covert agent at the time she was outed .
the __name1__ has verified this .
i always find it hysterically funny when a leftist suddenly develops a love for the __name1__ .
no , really .
after years of thinking the cia is putting microchips in their butts , they suddenly loooooove the __name1__ when it has a problem with __name2__ .
let 's be blunt .
this was intergency office politics ...
and it was bullshit .
the __name1__ told __name2__ , " it 's a slam dunk , mr. president " on __name3__ 's .
then there were n't any wmd 's and the fingerpointing started .
please .
she becomes " non @-@ covert " because no one was actually charged with that .
because her name was publically out there where even __name1__ could have figured out who she was .
it is n't covert when half the reporters and politicians in __name1__ knows you work at the __name2__ and you sent your house husband off on a junket because he looked bored around the house .
here 's the gag about __name1__ .
in febuary of __year1__ , he wrote an op @-@ ed where he not only said he believed __name1__ had __name2__ 's , but we should n't invade because he might use them .
so much for him knowing the " truth ".
<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2003/feb/06/opinion/oe-wilson6"> a ' big cat ' with nothing to __name1__ angeles times </a>
but after it all goes south and it looks like they might start firing people at the __name1__ , he goes public that he " knew " there were no __name2__ 's , and people asked , " who the heck is __name3__ ? "
yeah .
from what i 've read __name1__ was the best " unkept " secret in __name2__ . she was no more covert than i am .
her last assignment in __name1__ was a bust .
they had to send her home because the russkies knew who she was .
she was assigned desk duty thereafter .
can n't be covert when the enemy has you pegged .
as for __name1__ 's hell .
every intelligence agency in the world thought __name1__ had em and thats what the invasion was based on .
incorrect intel from everyone .
well , the reason why the intel agencies thought that was because that 's what __name1__ wanted them to think .
because he thought the reason why he did n't get ousted in __year1__ was becasue the alliance did n't want to fight a chemical war in __name1__ .
so as long as they thought he had them , he was safe , even as he gave most of them up and was unable to produce new ones .
how covert can you be when you and your husband are plastered all over his website along with where you work and what you do ?
that was one huge scam from the word go and designed to embarrass certain people , which as far as the __name1__ was concerned , did .
even when the bogus ' leak ' was revealed as an inside __name4__ thing , the __name1__ still tried to keep the illusion alive that it was __name2__ , __name3__ & co. who orchestrated the whole thing .
but we have a __name1__ that is considerably less than honest and ethical .
yep .
to bad they did n't do as thorough a job on __name1__ as they did on __name2__ , __name3__ and company .
imagine sending __quant1__ reporters to __name1__ to try to dig up dirt on a woman running for the vp slot on the __name2__ ticket .
those same __quant1__ could have done some digging on __name1__ when he was running for potus .
honest and ethical ? ?
our __name1__ ain't even in the ballpark .
the week ?
does he have a " __quant1__ free affair " card ?
__name1__ was a covert agent .
this is a fact .
let 's do n't argue about a simple fact .
you mean except no one was charged with outing an agent and her name was in the public domain and __quant1__ of __name1__ knew who she was ....
i guess " covert " is one of those words that does n't mean what it actually means .
next---
here 's another fact : the __name1__ administration broke the law in aiding the __name2__ .
__name1__ forbade the aid , the __name2__ administration went against the direct will of congress .
1 ) so what ?
2 ) the __name1__ , which was what was broken here , had no criminal penalty or enforcement procedures .
3 ) bonus cut @- the __name1__ only forbade budget funds from going to the __name2__ .
it did not forbid the profits of other ventures from going to them .
which is why no one was actually ever charged with sending arms to the __name1__ .
they were charged with things like " lying to __name1__ " when congress knew damned well what was going on .
i 'm shocked that there 's gambling going on here !
and another : mining the harbors in __name1__ was an act of war .
the harbor was secretly mined , no one was told , and when __name1__ found out about it , he tore __name2__ administration officials a new one .
was n't this when __name1__ was also claiming he believed in ufo 's ?
who cared what that senile old jerk thought at that point .
you can thump your chest and pretend that you like the president to break the law .
but you can n't pretend that what the __name1__ administration did , or what the __name2__ administration did , was legal .
and if my dad was the guy who had a gun held to his head by a crazed jihadi , i would n't care that __name1__ did something " illegal " to save his life .
nor would you .
this is our system of government , under the usc .
have you heard of it ?
and the __name1__ was free to impeach .
oh , but wait , they did n't do that !
because they were n't going to go out and impeach a president for not letting the commies win .
the judge accepted fitzgerald 's evidence that __name1__ was covert .
but again , no one was charged with that .
cute , but stupid .
the __name1__ is the authority on their agents .
if they say she 's covert , she 's covert .
so if they shoot you and say you were an enemy spy , you 'd take that on face value , too ?
her name being in who 's who is irrelevant .
deal with the reality here .
her name was known .
that she was a covert agent was not .
except __quant1__ of __name1__ knew she worked at the __name2__ and she was pulled out of __name3__ because the russians knew who she was .
jackie gingrich , __name1__ and his __value1__ wife 's daughter , however have refuted the story of him " divorcing his wife when she was battling __name2__ ".
jackie said--i 'm thinking in a __name2__ interview but can n't remember for sure--that it was her mother who requested the divorce and the tumor was benign , not __name1__ .
he did start dating marriane before the divorce was final and was cheating on marianne when he confessed that infidelity .
however those who condemn __name1__ 's personal life , which was pretty scuzzy , do n't seem to have a problem with president __name2__ 's affair with __name3__ , various other ' bimbo eruptions , and getting blow jobs in the oval office and do n't seem to think that impaired his ability to preside .
so either there is a huge double standard at play here or __name1__ 's infidelities do n't matter either .
how about it ?
__name1__ are the preacher party .
so __name1__ have to live up to that .
__name1__ are the bulk of the ones who claimed that __name2__ 's infidelities mattered .
i know a few __name1__ spoke out against him but they were few and far between .
i personally think that if hyde had n't rushed the matter through the __name1__ there might have been more time for some of the more serious allegations to be substantiated and for other people who had been keeping silent to speak up .
there might even have been official rape charges to contend with , not just rumors .
but hyde did rush it .
and basically the __name1__ looked mean for it , so they justly have to carry extra baggage around with them when they transgress traditional mores .
eneeeway ...
some people do object to both __name1__ and __name2__ .
but it 's not necessarily an incorrect double standard to condemn one and not the other .
__name1__ are the ones who said it mattered .
if you live by the sword , you die by the sword .
__name1__ can have their clintons and their weiners and move on from it more quickly than we can .
it 's just plain not the indictment of their __name1__ which __name1__ cheaters are of ours .
i am one who said the infidelities did not affect __name1__ 's ability to president any more than it affected __name2__ or __name3__ that we know fooled around and some others for whom there are suspicions .
and while i do not condone anybody cheating on his @/@ her spouse , and do think it calls their character into question , i am nevertheless fully qualified to comment on the reverse hypocrisy when __name2__ did n't condemn their own but hold __name2__ to a higher standard .
most especially when they have repeatedly accused us of condemning __name1__ for the ' blow jobs ' instead of the actual offenses .
__name2__ famous __quant1__ words were taken out __name2__ sotu address __name1__ gave because __name2__ intell to back it up was not there .
the __name1__ administration put them back in .
the famous __quant1__ words were correct .
the __name1__ did have evidence the __name2__ were trying to buy uranium .
__name1__ @-@ __name1__ stood by that statement .
so it was an accurate statement .
they did n't get it , but they asked for it .
look , guy , __name1__ went into __name2__ 's office and said " it 's a slam dunk , mr. president ! "
__name1__ wrote in the __name3__ that no only did __name2__ have wmd 's , but we needed to give him a graceful way out because he 'd use them .
this is a lot of people playing cya when something goes wrong .
if you had a real job , you see it happens every day in the business world , who ends up holding the bag of dog poop .
myself .
__name1__ was a scumbag and i 'm glad he 's dead .
are n't you ?
the fact that __name1__ said it matters makes his case different from __name2__ 's .
a free country must have honest leaders if it is to remain free .
we are in deep trouble as a society ...
people are looking for a guidepost as to how they should live , how their institutions should behave , and who they should follow .
that was in connection with the page scandals of __year1__ .
he stitched up his own baggage .
he has to carry it .
it 's good of you to try to be fairminded , but __name1__ made his samsonite .
deliberately and methodically .
now he has to carry it .
wow , you have totally drank the kool @-@ aid .
next , you 're gonna tell us that __name1__ was behind __name2__ @/@ __name2__ .
not at the cost of over $ __quant1__ and over 5,000 __name1__ military deaths .
hell no ! !!!
well then @-@ what is your opinion on us getting involved in __name1__ ?
i believe i have already stated that i think anyone who 's focusing on personal shit that 's between him and his ex @-@ wife is a dumbfuck who deserves to have the nation crumble around him while he pretends the president is just another celebrity to paparazzi to death .
of course , i think you 're a dumbfuck no matter what happens , so feel free to carry on your inane drivel indefinitely .
you probably believe that anyone who makes you look foolish is a dumbfuck , so i 'm ok with it .
my opinion is that __name1__ spent $ 1 t rillion to get __name2__ .
__name1__ spent $ 1 b illion to get __name2__ .
looks like __name1__ has plenty of ceo @-@ type executive experience to me .
i put the words they probably said ...
because they are the only ones that make sense .
grow a fuckin ' sense of humor , for crying out loud .
when you have to make heroes out of under @-@ acheiving affirmative action hires , you know you are really kind of weak in the hero department .
yes , i know .
the words that made sense to you .
the dialogue from the movie in your head .
meanwhile , we 've got a real world going on out here .
everyone in the real world thought she was lying through her teeth ...
__quant1__ points .
1 ) the __name1__ looked at the same evidence , and came to the same conclusions .
2 ) so you are saying that it was n't worth it if it went over a certain cost .
good thing you werne't around during __name1__ .
" wow , getting __name1__ is too expensive .
better just let him kill those people ."
i believe we lost that many to the days leading to __name1__ @-@ __name1__ and at __name1__ @-@ __name1__ .
back then it was a united country..
today is weaker because of the self righteous press of __name1__ , __name2__ and relive a past
the only thing that was indefensible was __name1__ 's total sloth on the __name2__ problem .
if he did n't need a distraction , he did n't give a shit .
this is a baseless claim , to distract from my point about __name1__ .
no , it 's a dead on claim .
he bombed the aspirin factory in __year1__ ( which turned out to have nothing to do with __name1__ ) the week he revealed he had been lying to us for __quant1__ months about __name2__ .
then he never , ever mentioned it again .
then __name1__ , whom non one ever heard of pops out of the woodwork and says , " i told __name2__ about __name3__ , and she looked at me funny ", when in fact , there are numerous taped interviews where it was clear __name2__ knew all about __name3__ .
so __name1__ did really nothing under __name2__ , and whined that he did n't get a promotion after __name3__ took over .
not even a good dodge .
answer the question @- why did n't your side hold __quant1__ senator accountable for voting for the war on your own side ?
it 's a good response to a really ridiculous comment .
you seem to be holding me personally accountable for how all __name1__ voted .
are you crazy ?
desperate ?
what ?
no , it 's not .
i was pointing out the hypocrisy of your party colletively , not you personally .
collectively , your party nominated __name1__ in __year1__ because he voted for the war , and in __year2__ , you did n't vote out __quant1__ senator who had voted for it .
not one .
you did try to go after poor __name1__ because he ignored the " war bad now " memo .
but even managed to survive as an independent .
okay , make it easy for you .
explain why i should give a shit about any of it ?
because you understand the basic nature of the nation that you live in .
i do understand it .
we have __quant2__ party that does the bidding of the rich , and another __quant1__ that is trying to make as many of us dependent on the government as humanly possible .
so it 's really a case of " choose your serfdom ".
what nation do you think we live in ?
okay , lumpy , i 'm ready now .
i 'm ready to start listening to what people have to say good for the guy .
has anyone been saying anything good about him ?
more specific than how smart he is ?
i have n't been paying attention to the whole thread .
lotsa noise in it .
but if you have , could you summarize the high points ?
what does __name1__ plan for the nation starting in __year1__ ?
i 'm ready to listen !
i was kinda asking for the beefs , there 's beefs a plenty ...
i have n't read the whole thread .
i did notice a theme of whining about his marital problems which seems odd to me coming from liberals .
they seem to want to keep __name1__ on a moral pedestal so that they can simultaneously tear it down .
i think __name1__ have been successful in down grading religious faith and morals down to a bigots paradise .
they use religion as a weapon..
it just not appropriate..
sorry i can n't summarize the high points ...
__name1__ & __name2__ starts in __quant1__ minutes..
see what your thread has become my friend lumpster ?
if i had more time i 'd figure it out but i suspect hypocrisy and liberal forked tongue desperation played a large part ...
ole buddy ...
you never heard of __name1__ , but that 's because you 're not particularly well informed .
there 's a record of __name1__ attempting to get the bushies to pay attention to __name2__ .
they held a meeting , finally , shortly before __name1__ @/@ __name1__ .
__name1__ received a memo shortly before __name2__ @/@ __name2__ called
that would be the same memo that called a hijacking plot not credible .
in fact , __name1__ rightfully said after that breifing that gave him no new information , " well , you 've covered your ass ."
clark was a non @-@ entity in an administration that just saw terrorism as a way to take attention away from bimbo eruptions .
this is mind blowingly stupid .
do you remember __name1__ @/@ __name1__ ?
do you grasp that __name1__ and __name2__ were right about __name3__ , and __name4__ and __name5__ were wrong ?
we nominated __name1__ because he voted for the war ?
well , you could have nominated __name1__ , who was against the war from the get @-@ go .
you did n't .
because you did n't want to appear weak .
and you thought a manufactured war hero would give you credibility .
oh , wait .
he got those purple hearts for minor injuries and then hung around with __name1__ after the war ....
ooooooops .
we nominated him because we thought he had the best shot .
i live in __name1__ .
a place with freedom of speech , and that freedom of speech has helped to secure your liberty .
the only thing that secures my liberty is that there are big , burley men with guns ready to do violence on my behalf--- to paraphrase george __name1__ .
the ability of liberal morons to say stupid things is just an annoyance .
bullshit .
reality is over your head .
i started my own thread for high points instead of beefs .
but it was royally hijacked .
hope it 's a good game !
without a doubt my friend .
false .
they looked at the evidence that __name1__ allowed them to see .
oh , right .
because clearly , none of these guys who had been around __name1__ longer than __name2__ had knew anyone over at the __name3__ or __name4__ .
because they had n't been looking at the same intelligence in the __year1__ 's that said the same things .
so , because __name1__ withheld key intelligence that undermined his case for going to war with __name2__ , __name3__ should have just hit up ' __name4__ "-like sources in underground parking lots to learn the truth ?
we were n't allies with those countries .
__name1__ did n't want a __value1__ war .
they thought the __value1__ was a pretty dumb idea .
had the __name1__ not bombed __name2__ , we 'd have let hilter win and not really cared .
we were n't allies with __name1__ and __name2__ ? ???
i 'm beginning to realize that i 've given you much too much credit .
a dictator who was n't a threat to us , had n't caused us any problems , and who was actually co @-@ operating with us at that point .
and all he had to do was let power go to some crazy islamists who are already sizing everyone up for burhkas ...
a dictator who killed hundreds of __name1__ by blowing up a plane over __name2__ .
as opposed to a dictator in __name1__ who never launched any terrorist attacks against the __name2__
so ?
does that make those __quant1__ deaths inconsequential ?
well , no.
i 'm interested in facts , i 've posted facts and the links to back them up .
you attempt to rebut them by imagining conversations and motives that suit your bias .
in almost every post , you put words into people 's mouths , and have them act out scenes based on your suspicions and dislikes .
that is not anything resembling a debate .
that 's you in a fight with reality .
quoting cecille :
__value1__ , calm down , and read what i 'm actually saying .
__name1__ spoke in speeches about his wife 's __name2__ .
both she and __name1__ say that she had __name2__ .
this is not something you need to debate , because it 's been established that she had __name1__ .
she had surgery for uterine __name1__ , and then later went in to have a tumor removed .
the tumor removed in the __value1__ surgery was benign .
that does n't make her not have __name1__ earlier .
she still had uterine __name1__ .
i 'm not sure where the " verge of death " comment comes from , but it is n't from me .
perhaps your let your imagination , or your anger , get the best of you .
__name1__ 's wife said the divorce came as a surprise .
__name1__ said that it did n't .
we have both of them on the record making these statements .
they do not agree .
there 's no point in you and i trying to figure out which of them is right , because they are the two people in the discussion , and they are not in agreement .
__name1__ has admitted that he cheated on both of his wives .
this is not up for debate .
he admits it .
__name1__ 's __value1__ wife says that he dumped her a few months after she was diagnosed with ms.
__name1__ is a reputable source .
the other sources are reputable as well .
you can n't spend your life ignoring inconvenient facts and expect to get anywhere .
take the car key out of your ear and listen to what i 'm saying .
you say that he says these things .
and then you cite only quotes from him admitting to the one thing i 've never argued .
furthermore , your sources for quotes are suspect , if not laughable .
so this basically amounts to your word for it , which i absolutely do need to argue .
no , you do not get to state that something is so and tell me to just accept it and expect that to happen .
i pay every bit as much attention to your half @-@ assed declarations of reality as i do to your piece @-@ of @-@ shit sources .
__name1__ is a reputable source in your opinion .
that means nothing .
your other sources are as reputable as a conversation overheard in a high school girls ' bathroom .
you can n't spend your life declaring things to be facts with no substantiation and expect to get anything but laughed at .
that 's where we are now .
when you are ready to show rather than tell , come find me .
until then , you no longer deserve even the marginal respect of having me read your posts , let alone respond .
begone .
who do you consider a reputable source ?
give me __quant1__ examples .
this should be entertaining .
where did that crazy bitch run off to ?
i can n't understand how anyone could be so lacking in common sense as to believe that __name1__ could ever be elected president .
i sense fear from your lash out rant .
__name1__ , " the manchild ", would lose big in a one on one debate with ol ' __name2__ .
no contest .
he can n't hide his gaffes , his hypocrisy on issues , his scandals on fast and furious , cronie capitalism on solyndra/sunpower/and his failed __name1__ approach to our economy .
that __name1__ @/@ cloward @-@ piven crap is running out of time .
i think michele should make a trip to __name1__ and stock on crybaby blankets and kleenix .
is __name1__ still in favor of __name2__ ?
i 'd be in favor of capping you , and trading you in for someone with a brain .
i would say everyone was wrong about __name1__ .
but __name1__ had __quant1__ years to do something substanive about the guy , from when the __value1__ __name2__ attack happened , to the bombing of __name3__ .
and he did nothing .
he let the guy walk out of the __name1__ ( after the sudan had offered to turn him over ) and into __name2__ .
__name1__ on the other hand , wiped out most of his network , toppled the __quant1__ regimes that __name2__ said was aiding him ( __name3__ and __name4__ ) froze his assets , captured or killed most of his key subordinates .
to the point that all he had left at the end was a house and his porn stash where he lived cowering in fear .
no.
everyone was n't wrong about __name1__ .
__name1__ was right .
__name1__ was right .
__name1__ was wrong before __name2__ @/@ __name2__ .
the people you 're citing who attacked __name1__ were wrong .
they complained that __name1__ kept coming in with his hair on fire---which means that he grasped the reality of the problem before __name2__ @/@ __name2__ .
but in order to defend __name2__ , the right has been forced to attack __name1__ for being overzealous ...
instead of having some degree of honesty and admitting that when clarke 's hair was on fire , __name1__ was right .
__name1__ was obsessed with __name2__ to the point that he was criticized for it .
<a href="http://www.snopes.com/rumors/clinton.asp"> __name1__ : clinton administration and terrorists </a>
as for __name1__ passing on __name2__ , are you determined to bring up every right wing myth in existence in this thread ?
__name3__ href="http://www.factcheck.org/2008/01/clinton-passed-on-killing-bin-laden/"> __name1__ __value1__ __name2__ bin laden ? </a>
really ?
does n't that say something about you guys , then ?
you do n't stand by your principles , you comprimise them because you want to win .
which is , of course , why you lost .
yes , it says that we are not rigid ideologues .
as for ' why we lost ', that 's pretty funny .
look at the crop of candidates that the pubs have this go round ....
please , do n't compromise your principles .
nominate __name1__ , and let him go down in flames .
clarkes story changed depending upon the audience .
that was clearly proven .
alright back to your rant .
actually , the only person who supported the " __name1__ was a prophet " bs is clarke .
a guy who we already caught lying when he said __name1__ did n't know what __name2__ was when she talked about it during several interviews in __year1__ and __year2__ .
therefore , nothing he said was believable .
you have a problem with attacking the person with hyperbole rather than with facts .
thus , you feel you can dismiss __name1__ by personally attacking him , dismiss hill by claiming her students were bored , for example .
that 's an illogical way to approach what we 're talking about .
__name1__ 's story is backed up by the record .
he asked for meetings on __name1__ , repeatedly .
we know that no meeting occurred , in spite of his asking for months , until shortly before __name1__ @/@ __name1__ .
we know that the people who dismissed __name1__ as having his " hair on fire " were wrong .
we know that __name1__ was right .
__name1__ was wrong .
give the man credit .
__name1__ did nothing about __name2__ .
come to think of it , that was pretty much his whole presidency , he just talked and talked and talked .
and took credit for the work of others .
kind of like the __name1__ .
you 're denying the reality of the record with more personal attacks on the person we 're discussing .
why , __name1__ does n't represent where most of the party is right now .
if we nominated a guy who was closest to where the rank and file is on the issues , we 'd nominate __name1__ or __name2__ .
not that it matters , though .
the __name1__ is going down .
so you 're saying that you 're not going to nominate __name1__ or __name2__ ?
as a prediction , i mean .
who 's going to be the nominee ?
__name1__ href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bqqldskjdu"> bush : " i 'm not that __name2__ bin laden __name3__ - youtube </a>
lol __name1__ said pretty much the same thing hack .
not to mention both presidents still pursued .
the biggest difference is __name1__ sat on it for months afraid to pull the trigger .
no , he absolutely did n't .
__name1__ href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkhsjrzutlq"> __year1__ in 2008 : ' we __name2__ bin laden , we __name3__ al qaeda __name4__ - youtube </a>
proof is in the puddin '.
__name1__ waited until the mission had the best chance of success .
he was right .
booyah !
that 's not completely true either .
what he did was the build up a relationship with elements in the __name1__ isi and military while rebuilding units that were completely devoted to taking out __name2__ .
this was a tricky and complicated set of operations that took a good amount of time to get to a point where it would have some level of achieving success .
i am really quite surprised he gave the __name1__ administration any credit at all .
but he did .
then is n't that waiting until there was the best chance of success ?
so , is __name1__ still in favor of cap & trade ?
liar .
" waiting " implies that there was an infrastructure already set up for the operation .
as in , all the dots were connected and __name1__ just simply had to wait on the " right time ".
that was not the case .
again , you 're a liar .
back up your bullshit .
i suspect they are awaiting instructions on how to counter facts with an alternative .
facts ?
" more people have been put on food stamps by __name1__ than any president in __name2__ history ."
- __name1__
more were added to food stamps under __name2__ than under __value1__ , <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/story/2012-01-18/fact-check-gingrich-obama-food-stamps/52645882/1"> reports </a> brooks jackson : " __name3__ gingrich claims that ' more people have been put __value1__ stamps by __name1__ obama than any president __name4__ american history .
' he 's wrong .
more were added under __name1__ than under __name2__ , according to the most recent figures ...
__name1__ would have been correct to say the number now on food aid is historically high .
the number stood at __quant1__ persons as of __month1__ , the most recent month on record .
and it 's also true that the number has risen sharply since __name1__ took office .
but __name1__ goes too far to say __name2__ has put more on the rolls than other presidents .
we asked the __name2__ 's __name1__ for month @-@ by @-@ month figures going back to __month1__ __year1__ .
and they show that under president __name1__ the number of recipients rose by nearly 14.7 million .
nothing before comes close to that ."
of course , you would n't know a fact if it pushed your customer out of the way and bit you on the ass .
did you even read this ? ...
what a spin..
it 's __name1__ 's fault for the recipients added during his admin , but somehow not so for __name2__ because he inherited a mess ?
not to mention in a mere __quant2__ years , __name1__ has added only a few hundred thousand less than under __name2__ 's __quant1__ ?
priceless .
by what criteria does anyone justify blaming a president for how many people were added to the food stamp rolls ?
specifically .
reporting facts that __name1__ may not like is liberal .
doing things that __name1__ may not like is presidential .
how dare the news report facts and ...
stuff !
liberals !
diversion ...
and not accurately addressing the real issue we have .
here is the issue..
__name1__ was reported this way ...
__name1__ , showing __name2__ how he , too , is human , referred to the __quant1__ satates today offering his overworked campaign staff reason to enjoy a much needed laugh .
__name1__ was reported this way ...
__name1__ , again showed reason to question his knowledge of the __quant1__ branches of government when he seemed to believe there are only 8 __name2__ justices .
his campaign staff is running around trying to put out the fires this has created for __name1__ 's campaign .
enough said .
so you want the news to do an in depth fact finding mission to determine if __name1__ has been to __quant1__ states and that would be fair since __name2__ said he never lobbied ?
immature diversion from the point i was making .
guess you just didnt have anything better to respond with .
is the media in the bag for __name1__ ?
__name1__ is .
just saying diversion doesnt work anymore .
you mean how to counter __name1__ hurt feelings right ?
everytime hes asked something he clutches his pearls and says " well , i never "
um ...
__name2__ played this up because __name1__ is a very right leaning state who already thinks the media is far left .
__name1__ basically jerked over all their faces and the people wanted more of it .
you can see it in this thread as well .
in the end the story is this .
newt played it up to the base , they loved it , but he still dodged the question .
you can n't take one debate in a primary and use it for the rest of the race .
if he were to win it would be a different ballgame , so his answer would have to be different .
or
he could answer it the same and risk loosing the middle more moderate indies and __name1__ ...
another one who decided to deabte something he knows nothing about .
obviously , you didnt watch the debate .
it 's a bit more than that .
he gets a standing ovation evey time he bitch slaps them !
he gets a standing o from an extreme wingnut crowd .
why should n't they let it be general admission , where __name1__ and independents could sit in the audience ?
curious ...
do you see the audiences at a __name1__ debate as an audience of extreme wingnuts ?
those would be ' moonbats '.
and no , i do n't see an exclusively liberal audience at __name1__ debates .
definitely lefties , though !
the media is biased in favor of a prolonged battle for the nomination because it 's better for ratings .
they will inevitably slant towards propping up the underdog and leaning on the favorite week by week day by day .
i watched the clip of it , he didnt answer it .
he whined about the media and how disgusting it was for them to ask such a question .
nice try .....
like i said its rather meaningless anyways .
__name1__ is a hypocrite when it comes to marriage so his opinions on it are meaningless .
hey folks ...
here it is ....
plasmaball thinks it is ok to debate something based on a snippet ...
a clip of what his media deemed was worthy of his knowing .
i mean ...
you actually said he never answered the question .
that is completely false .....
he answered it completely .
we do it all the time here ...
i watched the whole clip of him not really answering it , and giving __name1__ shit for it .
if there was more , feel free to provide said evidence and we can go from thier .
he didnt answer the question , he just blasted __name1__ and the media ( which was his answer ) .
im not sure where you are going with this and how you are reading my " he didnt answer the question ".
he answered it with a dodge .
when ?
where ?
you want to be the next one bitch @-@ slapped by __name1__ - ?
when he made his food stamp comment .
are you retarded ?
facts are sometimes difficult to accept are n't they ?
yeah , when they are not factual .
if the media is in the bag for __name2__ , then it is possible that __name1__ set up the question so __name2__ can answer in a forcible way .
forcible enough to send undecided __name1__ into his corner for the __name2__ primary .
i have called __name1__ a sabotuer for the __name2__ 's , and the ' handling ' of the debate by newt appeared staged to me .
if the liberal media was against __name1__ , they would have taken into account how newt performed against the moderator in past debates .
the moderators normally would not ask the question right off the bat( which __name1__ has done ) but knife __name2__ through his opponents like in previous debates so that __name2__ could not answer directly .
all __name1__ did was verbally body @-@ slam a liberal .
that is how a __name1__ won __name2__ in that case , __name3__ should run for president !
what makes you think __name1__ is a liberal ?
or were you not thinking ?
oh my fault .
it is better to say that __name1__ verbally body @-@ slammed __name2__ , a media outlet held to be liberally biased by many __name3__ .
now is there a problem ?
my was not a diversion .
mine was a response to something someone had said that was inaccurate .
no one is saying the media does not report the facts equally .....
they do .
but it is how they report them that makies it appear there is media bias .
with the __name1__ candidates ...
we hear the media say " rommeys critics feel he has something to hide in regard to his tax returns "
with __name1__ ....
we heard ...
" it is not unusual for a candiate to not want to release his college transcripts ...
some do , some dont ."
why didnt they say " __name1__ critrics feel he may have something to hide regarding his college transcripts ...
afterall ...
it is true..
his critics felt that
oh shit !
well , shit , why didnt you present that evidence earlier .
" why didnt they say..."
isnt proof of anything other than you thought up a question they didnt answer .
why didnt they ask __name2__ what happened to the millions that was lost in __name1__ ?
bias or they didnt ask ?
because i can think of questions they asked __name1__ and not __name2__ but what the fuck does that mean ?
nothing .
hey..
they intervvciewed __name1__ x right before a primary .
did they interview any of __name1__ former class mates ?
did they interview any of __name1__ parishoners at __name2__ ?
did they interview anyne part of the resko company ?
heck ...
i got a question ....
who did they interview to dig up any dirt that may be out there about __name1__ ?
who from his past did they intertview ?
yo ...
he reacted to the question ....
and then he answered the question .
yet the media that deemed it appropriate for the question to be asked did not feel the public warranted knowing his answer .
i willnot provide you a clip .
i dont need to .
you want to assume you are correct ....
go for it ....
live in your ignorance .
i love it .
the media is on __name1__ 's side ....
__name1__ stings them back .
actually , the media is on __name1__ 's side .
yes that is right -- which also compels them to favor __name1__ over __name2__ .
most __name1__ in __name2__ feel he will be __quant1__ of the easiest opponents for __name3__ to defeat in the general election .
right or wrong they think of __name1__ as more electable
who would think that ?
the guy wreakes of conservatism ...
ah cute spin .....
and lovely punt .....
you claimed he answered it , so it falls on you to provide proof .
you won't , i win .
hey ,
they asked __name2__ about __name1__ but never asked __name4__ about his relationship with the __name3__ ladens ...
you know what that means ...
yep , media bias .
we can do this all day but at the end of it all , it 's just you laying out bullshit to claim you are the victim of the liberal media , liberal education , liberal historians , liberal scientists , liberal brainwashers , liberal washing machines that wont get that stain out etc.
it must be tough always being under attack ...
thats when you let your conservadaddy hold you tight and tell you what a big bad world is out there and he 'll protect you
ahh ...
perhaps ....
from debate standpoint ...
sure ...
i wont produce the evinidence ...
so you win .
congratulations .
you won a debate with an anonymous poster on the internet .
yet you are please as punch that you have no idea that he answered the question .
an example of someone who prefers to be labelled a winner over knowing the truth .
i 'm waiting for them to interview __name1__ 's drug dealer .
you did not answer my question ....
they interviewed __name1__ ex wife right before a primary .
they interviewed people that worked for companies once owned by __name1__ .
who from __name1__ past did they interview ?
exactlyu ...
he admittted to using drugs .
do we know he did not have a bigger iussue ?
who did they interview to find out ?
he admitted to having some marxists semtiments while in college ...
who did they interview to discuss his " enthusiasm " or " lack of it " from back then ?
but they interviewed an x wife who had already told her story to the press several years earlier ...
and then made that the __value1__ question of a debate .
reverend __name1__ ...
any other assumptions ?
i 'm still waiting for them to interview gwb 's drug dealer and aa sponsors .
exactly gwb admitted to being a coke user ...
i 'm sure youre all broken up about them not interviewing gwb drug dealer .
or does you curiosity lose steam when you see the ( r )?
woooo i rule , i won a debate on the internets .... !!!!!
well my day is complete !
have a good day
hey ,
see how that works ?
exactly ...
reverend __name1__ .
__name1__ claimed to know nothing about his sentiments .
then he claimed he did but paid no mind .
so __quant1__ answer was a lie ...
so we know he , like all politicians , will lie for political expediency .....
so exactly who did they interview to find out the truth ?
you seem content with the truth ....
you know ....
" i didnt know of them ....
oh yeah ...
he was my mentor ...
so yes ...
i knew of them ....
but i never really paid attention..."
and you were just fine with that .
and to you ?
the media did a great job .
fyi ...
a simple __name1__ search will give you dozens of links to his complete answer .
but , of course , you prefer only knowing what your media wants you to know ....
so you wont conduct that search .
live in ignorance .....
enjoy .
first you complain they didnt interview anyone from his past .
since you are wrong now you are going back to the " they didnt ask the question i wanted them too sooo that means..."
moving those goalposts pretty fast there skippy
but in order to be a victim you have to see attacks from everywhere .
read ...
dont scan..
never said they did interview .
continually claimed they didnt ...
so tell me .....
show me who they interviewed .....
anyone ?
no way the " media " is bag for any __name1__ .
whatever they do in the primaries for or against a __name2__ is what they think will be best for the __name1__ .
are you saying no one interviewed rev __name1__ ?
however you spin it , __name1__ lied .
when ?
i 've found a new avie for you .
__value2__ href="http://www.usmessageboard.com/attachments/politics/17189d1327346960-is-the-media-in-the-bag-for-newt-head_up.jpg"> head_up.jpg </a>
ahh ...
what is __name1__ ?
of course the media is in the bag for __name1__ .
they would love to see him represent the __name1__ .
easy target , lots of baggage , a verbal gaffe just waiting to happen .
the only thing better than __name1__ would be gingrich/palin .
holy crap , they 'd think they had died and gone to heaven .
he answered the question , numbnuts .
the answer was her allegation was false .
he offered evidence and the networks ignored it .
or did you miss that part ?
it was a " when did you stop beating your wife " question .
he handled it very well .
you are aware that the __name1__ team are afraid of __name2__ getting the nomination are n't you .
in debates , __name1__ will kick __name2__ 's pseudo @-@ intellectual butt up __quant1__ side of the stage and down the other .
after all , all __name1__ has to run on is his dismal record and that alone has him pissing his pants .
still reheating that old food ?
i thought __name1__ was afraid of __name2__ , pailin , __name3__ and cain ?
what happened ?
__name1__
__name1__ was n't at the debate .
or did you miss that too ?
yes , they are , but they are wanting a __name1__ , __name2__ ticket , for the very reason that many conservatives despise romney
i pay the media no mind when i am voting anyways .
__name2__ is held to be a moron by many __name1__ .
does that make it true ?
rightwingers are professional victims™.
leftwing nuts are perpetual liars
uh ...
i do n't think so .
__name1__
right , because those corporate owned media outlets always favor the party that does n't favor them .
when ?
<a __value1__ attachment 17189 </a>
we already know that you are retarded .
until __name1__ gets the nomination ...
then the " free press " will make you question __name1__ .
peace ...
you need the press in order to question __name1__ ?
hey ,
victim cries victim
nope , never heard it and never said it .
__name1__ will kick ass in a debate with __name2__ .
but at least i 'm smart enough not to stick my head up my ass like you .
what 's your excuse ?
what i want to see is a presidential debate where __name1__ brings up __name2__ 's past affairs and __name2__ says " in both of your books you describe your cocaine addiction .
how about you give us the name of your dealer and how much you bought ."
roflmao ...
the media is in bed with __name1__ and any other __name2__ .
you 're just being silly .
yeah , just ask president __name1__ !
i do n't think __name1__ is .
he wants to win .
why does n't the op post the link where he got this hair brained idea from..?
__quant1__ read this from a article somewhere in the last couple days .
can n't remember where or i 'd post it .
i think his goofy rhetoric just gets eyeballs pointing at some screen be it a tv , tablet , smartphone , etc...
better to quote him @/@ opine on him and get the attention as a result than not .
at it 's heart , i think the members of the media from all outlets are just as worried about how a __name1__ presidency would hold ....
kids scrubbing toilets , orphanages , etc...
its about as far away from the ideal of __name1__ as one can get .
but when __name1__ suggested the same exact thing , it was labelled by the media and the left as a " wonderful " idea .
or did you forget abouyt __name1__ saying that all our younger generation should get involved at the community level ....
helping senior citizens , working in community centers , etc...
did you think he wanted them to do things like tax reporting and community planning ...
you know ...
things that require advanced educattions ? ?
you can provide a quote he wanted kids to do janitorial duties ?
i can for __name1__ .
your move .
not every thread is borne from some online story , bimbo .
some of us actually can think for ourselves .
i hope you are n't including yourself in that " we ", carpet puppet .
well , i 'm definitely not including you .
from the onset .
it was clear he was n't serious about being president .
serious meaning that he did n't take the time to prepare for the race .
he was a little busy recovering from back surgery , geaux , and he went into the race too soon after surgery .
he simply was n't himself .
coaches make their athletes take off __quant1__ year sometimes , depending on the surgery and the amount of time they can take a __quant2__ @-@ year @-@ old high school player to a __quant3__ @-@ year @-@ old professional ballhandler back on the field .
campaigns are rigorous , and __name1__ is i think at least __quant1__ .
i 'm sure he had the best of care , but i think i 've heard some surgery anesthetics become residual and might slow people down mentally and physically .
he had to have the surgery , and it was at the worst time .
he 's usually not one to get mixed up mid @-@ sentence and has always been a good speaker .
even so , it will be good to have our governor __name1__ back .
the perrys are real nice people .
oh , so he was hopped up on __name1__ ?
so he was , in fact , impaired while running for president ?
that 's a convincing argument .....
i 've yet to hear about this " residual/permanent " effects of anesthesia .
i suffered through about one million pre @-@ op consents and have yet to hear that listed as a possible adverse event .
though , i 'd be happy to look at any material you have .
are we going to blame anesthesia for __name1__ knowing jack and shit about foreign policy too ?
you guys can have him back .
i won't even mention that the rabbi & __name1__ were his early cheerleaders before __name2__ even opened his mouth .
when __name3__ 's name __value1__ came up as a possible candidate my thoughts were " another __name1__ after " __name2__ "?
you got to be kiddin me lol
today , __name1__ dropped out , and i had to dig down __quant1__ pages on usmb to find a thread on it .
not even a gloating thread by candycorn .
i 'm so disappointed .
ahh , so sad , really .
i had high hopes that __name1__ would be the guy who could bridge the divide between the __name2__ and the __name3__ establishment .
but it never came to pass .
first , the establishment has it 's heart set on __name1__ .
if they have to lie , cheat , steal or do whatever , that 's what they 'll do .
and they 'll blame us when __name1__ loses .
but __name1__ made mistakes .
much like __name1__ __quant1__ years ago , you simply can n't do these things on the fly . you have to build an organization , you have to get used to stumping , you have to get supporters lined up .
you have to participate in the early debates with the fringe characters to find your voice and your little corner to base yourself in .
i think that there will be people who will declare the __name1__ dead .
i do n't think so .
the thing is , the __name1__ has n't really been around long enough to establish solid leaders .
it took __quant1__ years between __name1__ and __name2__ for the modern conservative movement to take hold .
after __name2__ loses , __name1__ might well be able to take another shot at it .
but he should take his time and spend more time introducing himself to the __name1__ public .
1 · 2 · uhmmm .
__name1__ , some help please .
he stumbled badly in the __value1__ debate and never recovered .
it takes a lot more than slogans and platitudes to win over conservative s . they are smart and they research issues , they want substantive answers .
__name1__ could n't answer the questions in depth and it showed .
if __name1__ was a __name2__ , he 'd be their candidate - liberals will buy anything ....
hope and change anyone ?
i believe several things hurt __name1__ .
he did have surgery , and the effects of anaesthesia can last a long time .
__name1__ entered the race too late , he also just for whatever reason was not himself .
unfortunately for __name1__ , by the time he started doing really good in the debates , it was too late .
if __name1__ had started the debates they way he did his last __quant1__ debates , he would most likely have the nomination locked up .
it is sad that __name1__ started off as bad as he did , he was the only candidate that stood up for and defended the __name3__ who pissed on the bodies of the __name2__ .
i am going to support the __name1__ and disagree with __name2__ and you .
it takes a lot more than slogans and platitudes to win over conservatives .
they are smart and they research issues , they want substantive answers .
okay then ...
as a conservative you should be able to tell us what __name1__ 's plans for the military are then , right ?
i do n't mean where he 's going to send them .
i mean , is he going to increase the size , decrease the size , close bases in __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , etc....?
surely as a " smart " conservative , you 've " researched " the issue and he 's provided substantive answers .
total agreement about __name1__ .
he has never run in a race where the result was n't a foregone conclusion .
it showed on the national stage and such non @-@ vetting of candidates by __name1__ has shown in their state 's dismal performance compared to other states .
read his book sweetheart , it 's all there - with pictures too ! !
unfortunately he does n't have anything as catchy as " hope and change " to hold your interest .....
so essentially , for completely superficial reasons , we are rejecting the most qualified candidate and nominating a __name1__ , hoping to __name2__ no one notices his religion is batshit crazy and he 's flip @-@ flopped on every issue out there .
yup .
makes sense to me .
those are n't superficial reasons .
__name1__ is not a leader , at least not of the most important country on earth .
the people whom he led in the past do n't want him now , and his temperament is not suited to the presidency .
sorry .
given those people were a large part of the problem , and could n't wait to get back to making deals with the other side , not seeing their objections as being the problem .
i look at the results @- balanced budgets ( kind of ) , welfare reform and serious changes in the way __name1__ did business .
but , heck , no , we do n't want any real reform .
we want a guy who is going to cut more deals with the special interests , because that 's worked so well for the country .
sure , i like __name1__ .
he 's a very smart man .
he did some good things in office so we have to give credit where credit is due .
i even considered supporting him .
but i won't be .
caroljo ......
has anyone ever told you that they admire your depth of thought ?
i do n't know you , so i 'm not sure if you 're being serious or a smarta $$
he 's being a jackass .
" smart " anything is a bit of a reach for him .
i figured that ....
thanks !
lol !
i thought you said in another thread that you were n't voting in the __name1__ primaries ...
it 's kind of hard to keep your stories straight though ...
and , hey , that cartoon you have in your sig line is just kind of creepy .
just sayin '.
bring back the kitten .
__name1__ is killing it in these debates
until the fact -@ checkers step @-@ in .
__month1__ @/@ __day1__ @/@ __year1__
“ as [ __name1__ ] speaker , i came back , working with president __name2__ .
we passed a very __name1__ @-@ like program : less regulation , lower taxes .
unemployment dropped to __value1__ percent .
we created __quant1__ jobs.” — __name1__
" former president __name1__ would be shocked at this description , since he always credited the __quant1__ jobs created during his presidency to the deficit @-@ reduction package he narrowly passed early in his tenure without a single __name2__ vote . "
__name1__ frig newton ; · full @-@ o ' @-@ shit , as usual </a>
i 'm not a huge fan , but i have to give credit where credit is due and he 's wiping the floor with the __name1__ field in these debates .
i wish __name1__ was a little bit more articulate and less frenetic in his responses .
he definitely offers the most substance in his replies , but a lot gets lost in translation .
__name1__ is a milquetoast douchewagon who can n't even give a straight answer to a simple question like ' do the states have the right to ban contraception ?
get used to the idea of __quant1__ more years of the __name1__ @-@ __name1__ .
that was a stupid question and did n't deserve and answer..
and that 's the truth .
ruth .
i do n't think that anyone has " killed it " in the debates .
i think __name1__ has been the most accurate and forthright .
he has been married __quant1__ times , currently for __quant2__ years to __name1__ , and i respect the fact that , in spite of political consequences , he has been divorced __quant3__ times , rather than having a sting of lovers , while married to __quant5__ woman , as so many other politicians try to get away with .
i like __name1__ because i trust newt .
he is the least pc of them all , thus far , and in my opinion .
source : __name1__ .
" a profile of former __name2__ speaker __name1__ ."
__value1__ .
__name1__ has been neither forthright or accurate .
i think it was __name1__ who said that , and i like it .
__name1__ is also a pathological liar .
and he took an active part in destroying the economy by helping the gses defend themselves when some members of __name1__ were trying to unwind them .
he 's a gigantic hypocrite as well .
while he was excoriating __name1__ for cheating on __name2__ , and made it a special point to say he was going to bring up __name3__ every chance he got , he himself was cheating on his own wife .
he was the __value1__ speaker of the __name1__ in history to be fined .
he was caught lying to __name1__ .
again , while he was trying to impeach __name1__ for lying .
he left his job in disgrace .
and now ... <a href="http://mobile.bloomberg.com/news/2012-01-09/romney-s-bain-capital-leadership-attacked-as-exploiting-companies-for-cash"> he 's going the __name1__ marxist </a> route of attacking creative destruction .
“ those of us who believe in free markets and those of us who believe that , in fact , the whole goals of investment is entrepreneurship and job creation , would find it pretty hard to justify rich people figuring out clever , legal ways to loot out a company , ” former __name2__ speaker __name1__ told reporters in __name3__ , __name4__ , yesterday , ahead of the state ’s __month1__ __day1__ presidential primary .
“ __name1__ is not a capitalist , ” tyler said .
“ he is a predatory corporate mugger .
if you ever wonder why so many manufacturing jobs are overseas , you need to look no further than __name1__ .
he can claim thousands of jobs created , only those jobs were created in __name1__ and __name2__ .”
neocons have been mistaking the elephant 's shit for the elephant .
it is time to sweep __name1__ into the dustbin .
you 're getting your position on other people 's intelligence from __name1__ .
' nuff said .
he 's only a __name1__ winner .
why do wingnuts hate intelligence ?
..... <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/romney-owes-his-boost-to-gingrich/2012/01/16/giqalrrc3p_story.html?hpid=z6"> can be __name1__ republican @-@ candidate </a> !!!!
please show the intelligence prerequisite for the __name1__
did manifold say __name1__ was wiping the field with the __name2__ in the debates ?
um ...
does he know that __name1__ is n't debating the __name2__ ?
__name1__ got the __name3__ for economics , not peace .
however , he 's still an idiot .
i 've seen some debates where __name1__ 's opponent had him practically in tears .
sit him down with __name1__ .
it would be priceless .
i think such an encounter actually occurred .
however , i 'm not certain of it .
the readers of this column know that i never make charges of racism .
maybe __name1__ and the __name2__ occupiers have the answer .
<a href="http://cnsnews.com/node/464826"> link </a>
another dope who does n't believe in facts .
i do n't think he said that .
more likely , he said that the winner of these __name2__ debates is __name1__ .
because he is .
no you have n't .
__name1__ is a loon
<a href="http://cnsnews.com/node/464826"> link </a>
wow , this guy is a moron .
no wonder you wingnuts like him .
it 's all deflection and misdirection .
this is an economist who does n't know about monopolies , cartels and collusion ?
nobody has included __name1__ as among ' the few '.
everything you know about monopolies , cartels and collusion .
cartels always fall apart .
cable monopolies are all government enforced .
all you did is demonstrate your complete ignorance .
no wonder you 're a __name1__ fan .
you left out oil companies , braniac .
there are a few who control the entire market .
are you saying that if a government does n't break up a monopoly ( cable ) , it is enforcing the monopoly ?
i nominate __name1__ at captain of the usa debate team for the __year1__ international debate olympics .
always knew __name1__ could tear it up in a debate .
i mentioned __name1__ , dipstick .
i 'll repeat , despite having no legal hindrances , __name1__ has been unable to enforce any of its production quotas or price limits .
government created the cable monopoly .
virtually every city in the country grants a monopoly to one cable company or another .
every true monopoly that has ever existed has been government enforced .
__name1__ are n't oil companies , braniac .
i 'm talking __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ ...
you think the companies you listed have a monopoly , seriously ?
since you can mention more than one , they obviously do n't have a monopoly .
furthermore , oil is traded on the world market , so it 's nonsensical to talk about __name1__ companies having " control " of the market .
furthermore , there are at least 20 __name1__ oil companies .
that hardly paints a picture of a limited number of competitors .
any way you look at it , you 're wrong .
or __name1__ .
god , i would pay money to see that .
dr. __name1__ won the __name2__ debate :
he won that debate :
__name1__ ’s crotchety meter was turned to 11 , with the scrappy texan refusing to give __quant1__ inch no matter how hard the moderators tried to shame him or put words in his mouth .
“ clearly you do n’t understand my position , ” he pushed back when pestered about his position on military spending .
take that , you hand @-@ wringing , comity @-@ obsessed wusses !
that would be like putting __name1__ 's brain in a __name2__ .
that 's exactly why i 'd be willing to pay big money to see it .
once the __name1__ primaries are over , the election begins in earnest .
what will __name1__ run on ?
__name1__ knows who wrecked the economy .
that __name1__ hid the cost of the wars from the country .
that the bulk of the deficit comes from the __name1__ tax cuts , the " __name2__ " bill and the unnecessary war .
__name1__ and the __name2__ held both houses and the presidency for __quant1__ straight years .
they have nothing to be proud of during that entire time .
in fact , they even let __name1__ go .
you can n't run on , " we have to get __name1__ out of office because he ( and then name __name2__ failure )".
this is n't the " reagan legacy project ".
people remember who did what .
there is a strategy called , " just that __quant1__ fact alone ".
__name1__ took us out of __name2__ , just that __quant1__ fact alone .....
__name1__ saved the auto industry , just that __quant1__ fact alone .....
__name1__ got __name2__ , just that __quant1__ fact alone .....
__name1__ made it possible for people to insure their collage age children , just that __quant1__ fact alone ....
__name1__ helped extend unemployment for suffering __name2__ , just that __quant1__ fact alone ....
__name1__ can n't use that strategy .
it would backfire .
there were no wmd 's .
just that __quant1__ fact alone ....
__name1__ helped the __name3__ to move millions of jobs to __name2__ .
a __name1__ apologized to __name2__ . just that __quant1__ fact alone ....
__name1__ did nothing for those __name2__ survivors .
just that __quant1__ fact alone .....
__name1__ say disaster victims low priority .
see how this is a strategy that will work for __name1__ but not for __name2__ .
so please , someone explain to me what they will run on .
once you hit the general election , the truth will come out .
wow .
just wow .
here it is years later and according to __name1__ , it is still __name2__ 's fault .
here it is years after voters turned over control of __quant1__ branches of government to democrat control and __name1__ are still insisting that they still are n't responsible for a fucking thing !
sorry -@ but you whackos are just that .
really , really whacko .
get a clue -@ it is hard to insist the fault even __quant1__ later lies with the out of power party honey .
maybe that bullshit still sells in nutjob land but not among normal people .
i 'm not even going to address the stupid idiotic crap you wrote -@ there is no point .
__quant1__ 'm still trying to grasp the mentality that will not only say but believe it when they say even when __name1__ have super majorities and total control of __quant2__ branches of government meaning they have no brakes at all , had no reason to compromise with __name2__ over anything and did n't and even __quant1__ later -@ they still are n't responsible for a fucking thing .
not ever .
oh sure .
and apparently this really works for some which speaks volumes about who are their natural constituents and base .
sorry -@ i 'm truly just not stupid enough to be a __name1__ .
i can n't read stupid shit like this because there is no intelligence behind it .
you are absolutely correct .
there is no point .
it 's not like it can be denied .
__name1__ do n't seem to have a problem assigning all their fiascoes to __name2__ or the __name3__ .
__name1__ .
just that __quant1__ fact alone will be used against __name1__ .
also , __name1__ said he should be held accountable if he did not get the economy going .
well , unemployment is still in the crapper , and if it still is in __month1__ , that __quant1__ fact alone will sink him .
yea , because health care for __name1__ is so bad .
__name1__ ’s campaign manager died of pneumonia , penniless and uninsured
and so , what started in __month1__ __year1__ with __quant1__ laptop in snyder 's __name1__ , va . , apartment , quickly grew into a $ __quant2__ campaign employing __quant3__ people .
in the __quarter1__ quarter of that year , snyder raised a stunning $ __quant1__ for __name2__ — more than any other __name1__ candidate had raised at the time .
*the __name1__ quoted his sister at the time as saying that a " a pre @-@ existing condition made the premiums too expensive ."
despite __name1__ ’s insistence that charity is the appropriate response to __name2__ ’s uninsured crisis , snyder ’s friends raised $ __quant2__ , far short of the $ __quant1__ necessary to pay his bills .
<a href="http://crooksandliars.com/john-amato/was-ron-paul-thinking-his-former-campai"> that 's what freedom is all __name1__ ron __value1__ 's former campaign manager had no health insurance , got sick and died in debt </a>
so that 's the __name1__ plan ?
the tax payer should foot the bill .
wow , how " free ! "
i want to see __name1__ run on this .
what fiascoes are you talking about ?
make sure you can prove it .
do n't just lie .
says the op that piled shit high enough to defy gravity
__name1__ has even assigned his failures to " bad luck ".
i am so shocked that __name1__ can treat __quant1__ of there own in such a way as they have regarding __name2__ .
i am a registered __name1__ .
i intend to vote for __name1__ .
i like __name1__ but am not sure he can get things done .
i am also a member of the __name1__ .
i know that this is an issue for alot of americans but can not understand why ?
why should it matter ?
this is why we live in a free country .
__name1__ is the only candidate who can win .
stop all the negative ads ( __name2__ ) you are just giving amunition to __name1__ .
i am sure he is just relaxing and lauphing while all of you are fighting .
get over it and think about what is at stake .
grow up .
and get behind him .
__name2__ was a __name1__ , kennady was a __name3__ .
remember separation of church and state ! !!!!
__name1__ will not try to convert all of you .
he just wants what is best for the country .
oh and you evangelicals , if you are really __name1__ then act like it .
stop spreading fear and hate ! !!!
good tell all your friends to vote for him too .
bashing __name1__ does not have anything to do with his religion for most .
this is a primary , primaries get ugly , and it ’ll make the candidate stronger in the end if its __name2__ most __name1__ ’ will support him
exactly .
if i were __name4__ i 'd be embarrassed by __name1__ and __name2__ out there calling __name3__ a big meany .
makes __name1__ look like a cupcake .
i 'm a __name1__ supporter .
i do n't think __name1__ has earned back any of his lost support with his attacks .
i think if his ads make people back away from __name5__ their votes will go to __name1__ or __name2__ or maybe __name3__ , not __name4__ .
but for the most part i think it 's good that __name1__ is taking the heat now ...
so there are no surprises later and because i think it will prepare him for the showdown with __name1__ .
i agree with you but can n't understand why __name1__ is such a cry baby .
he is the one who wants to dish it out but can n't take it .
oh and being a conservative ?
throws __name1__ under the bus while having an affair .
that just shows him to lack character when this is what we need most .
__name1__ threw down the gauntlet .
i 'm not watching __name1__ cry . i 'm watching __name2__ give __name3__ back a knuckle sandwich .
__name1__ went heavy negative __value1__ .
it 's game on now .
and __name1__ by the way had to pursue __name2__ for purgery .
it had nothing to do with an affair .
and actually , __name1__ defended __name2__ 's bombings in retaliation for the attacks on the embassies when everyone else was running around saying president clinton was just trying to deflect from having to testify .
__quant1__ spent to target __name1__
by gary cohen
of the __name1__ caucuses , well @-@ funded so @-@ called super pacs are using the political clout given to them by the nation 's highest court in an unprecedented tour de financial force .
data collected by the __name2__ indicates __quant1__ super pacs have raised more than $ __quant2__ and spent almost $ __quant3__ in the __year1__ election cycle thus far , __name1__ reports .
the lion 's share of the money those groups have spent has targeted former __name3__ speaker newt __name2__ , according to __name1__ .
the impact in __name1__ is clear : iowa voters are being reminded repeatedly about __name2__ 's ties to __name3__ , his divorces , and his lengthy __name4__ career .
" this is politics " former __name2__ gov. __name1__ said last week when he reacted to calls for him to condemn attack ads run by the group __name3__ .
the __name1__ points out that those were part of a $ __quant1__ negative ad campaign waged by the group against __name2__ .
candidates with enough financial clout are able to lay their own groundwork to mobilize voters and remain positive while the super pacs continue to run negative ads , the __name1__ reports .
campaign finance observers have been concerned that empowered by the __month1__ __year1__ __name1__ ruling allowing independent groups to raise and spend unlimited money , such groups would change the balance of campaigns dramatically .
in the past the political battlefield has been overseen by political party organizations and candidate committees .
according to a __name1__ analysis of independent expenditures thus far this election cycle , super pacs have combined to spend $ __quant1__ in the __name2__ primaries , including at least $ __quant2__ in __name3__ alone .

vote here now !
i 've got no dog in this hunt amelia and i 'm loving the battle .
if your man comes out as the candidate not one person can ever , ever say it was a coronation or he got it on a silver platter .
he will have come thru hell and high water to have earned it .
serious question .
do you ever actually work ?
lol , fair question .
short answer , yes .
i meet with my clients initially to discuss their needs and desires .
usually that takes several hours .
then if hired i accompany them to speciality showrooms to pick products .
then after the products are chosen a design and layout is drawn up .
this can take anywhere from a few hours to a few days depending on the degree of difficulty .
once physical work begins i help with deconstruction to ensure damage is not done to things that are n't being changed .
i personally do all the framing for any new construction .
i do all the cabinetry and plumbing and most of the electric .
but , the actual stone and finish work i do not do much of anymore .
i 've had surgery twice and after the last one i hired a permanent partner to handle the finish work .
while he oversees that i begin working with the next client .
an average job for us lasts anywhere from __quant1__ weeks to a month __quant2__ .
sometimes we will take commercial jobs that last longer but its mostly high end residential .
i 've been doing this for nearly __quant1__ years and the system i 'm currently using allows me substantial free time .
it 's worked for about the last decade .
i love my job .
many remodeling jobs simply only allow for so many bodies to fit into the workspace .
unless business is so slow that its eating into my savings in a major way i work my help __value1__ .
they have families and i have loyal help .
it 's a perfect fit for both of us .
thanks for your curiosity , although i suspect your motives were dubious at best .
thanks for the answer .
as for my motives ....
well you 're on this site pretty much all day every day , so __quant1__ really wondered how you can possibly be busy at work .
he bought companies that were in trouble and made sure they failed in a way that made him money .
still no good way to spin this to seem as if he had an honorable profession that was a credit to good capitalism .
you are showing how naive you are as it pertains to what __name1__ does .
they seek out failing businesses and do their best to turn them around .
under romeny 's watch , they achevied a success rate of __value1__ %...
an excellent record .
without bain capital , that __value1__ % of businesses would have failed ....
lmfao .....
made sure they failed in a way to make him lots of money .
you are pathetic .
serious aye ...
no wonder you come across as an idiot .
tell me more about __name2__ __name1__ .
oh wise one .
lol ...
and __name1__ .
fyi rdd ...
i have decided to retire ...
ill tell you all about it if you want to know ....
retire ? ?
from this site ?
or from your job ?
pm me .
i follow your logic .
even today i was out .
a lot of times i post while waiting on clients or simply when i 'm overseeing work underway .
honestly , most of my work happens in evenings and weekends .
gotta work around the customers schedule .
you will get a break from me tomorrow as i have cabinets and plumbing to work on all day .
pm sent .....
from my career .....
lol ...
congrats , i hope ?
the poor __name1__ @/@ __name2__ supporters , they must be so damn confused on what their talking @-@ points should be .
some come here everyday boasting about how well __name1__ is doing , not realizing they 're supposed to hate wall street .
clearly their talking @-@ point signals have been severely crossed up .
do they love __name1__ ?
do they hate __name1__ ?
who knows ?
they do n't even know .
i guess all that __name1__ and __name2__ stuff is n't helping them much .
stick around a bit longer and you 're sure to see an __name1__ @/@ __name2__ supporter here crowing about how great __name3__ is doing .
it 's pretty bizarre but very funny too .
boasting about it as __name1__ demonizes them on one hand and garners campaign funds from them all in the same breath ...
astounding .
the sheep are confused by the actions of thier herders .
yeah , there are a few rabid loyal __name1__ @/@ __name2__ supporters who routinely come here crowing about how well __name3__ is doing .
it 's hilarious everytime i see them doing that .
they do n't have a clue as to what their talking @-@ points should be anymore .
should they love __name1__ ?
should they hate __name1__ ?
they 're just so confused .
i guess they see __name1__ doing well as somehow a benefit to their guy in the __name2__ .
so they they 're torn between cheerleading for __name1__ and hating wall street .
they just do n't know which talking @-@ point to embrace .
stick around awhile longer and i 'm sure you 'll see a couple of them expressing this confusion .
it 's some fun entertainment .
indeed .
you try to educate them and it is roundly rejected .
so why not laugh at thier foibles as a consolation prize ?
the __name1__ mission was the change the narrative from deficits to income inequity .
in that sense __name1__ was successful .
actually , it changed the narrative from deficits to " hey , look at those trustafarians camping out in the middle of the city , smoking dope , raping each other and shitting all over the place , " then it went back to deficits .
but at least those brats think they had their own little __name1__ moment , which counts for something , i suppose .
booyah !
__name1__ changed the discussion .
that alone is a major victory .
if the dems follow up , and use the real inequities that exist in our system , present remedies for those inequities , we may see some real progress this election .
you do know , do n't you , that your saintlike dems are perpetuating and profiting from those inequities ?
they do n't give a shit about you , roxy .
but you just keep blindly pulling that __name1__ lever .
no shit .
voting for the people that are taking advantage ...
stuffin ' thier pockets ...
and ' the other guys ' are responsible .
the sheep are indeed bleating ...
useful idiots are useful .
it is slowly recovering on its own despite __name1__ policies and business crunching regulations .
i am very glad it is coming around but i just wish we could vote __name1__ out now to expedite the process .
my prediction is that if __name1__ loses the election growth will double the current snails pace its growing at .
in fact i bet upon the news alone that he loses the election we will start seeing firms hire and invest exponentially .
__value1__ job growth ? </a>
<a href="http://www.decisionsonevidence.com/2011/10/do-regulations-curtail-job-growth/"> | decisions based on evidence </a>
the number of layoffs nationwide caused by government regulation is minuscule and shows no evidence of getting worse during the __name1__ administration .
lack of demand for business products and services is vastly more important .
nice quote and all ...
but the concern was that regulations would curtail the hiring back of people already laid off ....
not result in further lay offs .
companies had trimmed themselves down to the bare miunimum ....
no one was really looking at additional layoffs ....
with the exception of companies going out of business .
you quoted an article that does not at all address the issue of regulations costing employers money that they may otherwise invest back into the company so they can bring it back tot he size it was before the recession .
the quote does n't , but the article itself does .
it shows that it is a myth that regulations curtail job growth at any signficant level .
this is according to a __name1__ economist and the __name2__ .
so sueing companies like __name1__ because they want to build in a state his " friends " do n't control is not hurting job growth ?
or regulating farm dust or putting light bulb companies out of business or stopping oil drilling for so long all the platforms went to other countries instead of waiting or any other numerous stupid decision he has made .
the point is , any economic growth that __name1__ is inhibiting is miniscule in comparison to other factors .
rather than blaming politicians , we need to blame the state of the market .
maybe but he has had a hand in the demise of tens of thousands of jobs .
minuscule as that may be , explain that to those who have lost out because of him or his administration .
let me ask you this question ....
if you were about to open a lemon aid stand ...
and your business plan allowed for an __value1__ % net profit by the end of your __value2__ rd year ...
but a large personal investment to start .....
but there was word coming from __name2__ that the __name1__ , with the presidents blessing , was going to pass new regulations on the purchasing and use of lemons ....
nothing concrete ....
nothing for sure ....
just word going around ....
would you dive into the venture ...
or wait until you knew what the __name1__ was going to do ?
he also had a hand in creating close to 3 million jobs .
any given regulation ...
perhaps not..
but knowing that there is a large influx of regulations ...
and many more to come ?
it is that " concern for the unknown " that stymies economic growth .
knowiung what the regulation is allows one to compensate..
and move forward .
not knowing what is to come and how much it will cost ?
that si what we are referring to..
and we have a regulation happy administration right now ...
that you cant deny .
nonsense .
he has invested in mostly failed enterprises .
there are fewer jobs available now than there were before he took office .
he may have helped " a specific " segment , mostly govt or unions but that 's it .
what regulations would those be ?
i just gave all my employees a __value1__ % raise and am looking seriously at renting another warehouse .
if you read the article , it also says that __name1__ try to perpetuate the myth about the uncertainty businesses face due to regulations .
he took my money and gave it to joe so joe can hire tom to do work that gary and his employee zach would have done but wasnt allowed to do becuase __name1__ said he wanted joe to do it with his new employee tom .
so gary and zach lost their jobs and tom got a job .
thus why __name1__ " created " millions of jobs ....
but there are 1.8 million less people working now .
are you not aware of how that happened ?
oo can i come work for you ?
it is not a myth .
it is real .
it is basic business logic .
you do not make business moves if you can not accurately forecast .
sort of business planning 101 .
this is what the __name1__ did to jobs since they took office in __month1__ __year1__ .
there is no jobs recovery .
just workers falling of the unemployment rolls .
no jobs have been created .
just job loss as far as the eye can see .
umm , okay , so why did n't tom get the job if joe wanted him ?
i do not understand what would be stopping him .
it affects small businesses , sure .
untrue , he created __quant1__ private sector jobs under the stimulus .
ok ...
then you can relate ....
one of my clients was hit with a new local ordnance regarding loading bay width .
apprarently , some worker at some other company did not follow loading bay rules and tried to walk around the far side of a truck that had little clearance from the wall to the side mirror ....
he nerly took his entire nose off ....
for the truck mirror was damaged and sharp .
so the local legislator pushed for a new regulation adding __quant1__ inches to the width of a loading bay .....
and it was instituted .
my client had __quant1__ months to comply wioth the new regulation .....
and as you know .....
it is pretty expensive to have to widen a loading bay .....
he did it at a cost of over 75k .....
during a year where his profits barely allowed him his basic s @-@ corp salary of 1k per week ...
and no distributions ...
so he was forced toactually spend an extra 75k in __quant1__ year where he took home only 52k ...
ya think he wanted to hire new people ?
the thing people forget , __name1__ workers even without unions will never work for what someone in __name2__ will work for .
the one thing we need to do , is not cater to corporations who make their product overseas .
you want factory jobs back , that is the only way that will happen .
that 's where most jobs originate unless your flipping burgers .
you need to be a business owner to understand intitiatives and what is fluff and what is otherwise .
what so if a business needs to borrow , they just should fail , huh ?
if it needs to borrow to stay afloat ...
yes ...
it should fail for its business model is flawed or it would have the capital to stay afloat when times are lean .
it simply means it will ultimately fail with even more debt if it borrows to stay afloat · if it needs to borrow to expand ....
then yes ...
it should borrow .
i was against the gm bailout .
it was unfair to __name1__ who had a soloid business model .
gm blew it and it was rewarded .
okay , so what should __name1__ have done for small businesses , in your opinion ?
day __value1__ he should have told them thatthe __name1__ woulkd be extended to all .
he should not have cherry picked who got stimulus money .....
for any small business trying to compete with another small business that got money had no shot in hell .
the stimulus should never have been instituted .
he should have announced on day __value1__ that the whole cap and trade thing will not pass under his watch ....
he should have thanked all business owners for their perseverence and hard work ...
not viliified them .
he should have done __quant1__ of __quant2__ things ....
either wait until next term to pass healthcare ...
or allowed business owners to know exactly what it will cost them ...
something many of them still cant figure out and wont be able to figure out for __quant1__ more years .
thats a start .
he extended the __name1__ tax cuts
that is part of being a __name1__ .
therefore , there are __quant1__ sides to the issue .
the private sector saw an increase of __quant1__ jobs under the stimulus .
villified them ?
that is complete hyperbole .
you may have a point about the healthcare bill .
__name1__ is not helping the economy to recover , he is slowing its growth
good luck with that one .
true , but __name1__ has done a lot for small businesses :
1 ) he extended loan programs for small businesses .
2 ) he established an initiative for small businesses in rural areas .
3 ) he was half successful in trying to eliminate capital gains taxes for small businesses .
4 ) create a $ __quant1__ tax credit for businesses adding jobs
5 ) raise the small business investment expensing limit to a quarter of a million .

the thing about biased sources is basically this : " that may be true , but so is this..."
therefore , i do n't take sources like that seriously .
yes ...
he fianlly did ...
but didnt agree to do it for the business owners until the last minute ....
and low and behold ....
jobs are starting to be created .
yet there are 1.8 million jobs less than when the stiumulus was passed .
i explained how that happened in an earlier post .
many companies went oob becuase they could not compete with companies that got stimulus money ...
and the companies that got that money hired some of those same people that lost jobs when the conmpetitor went under
yes..
he villifed them .
have you ever heard him talk about the great financial risk one takes when they start a business ....
when they hire an employee .....
did he ever mention that the last __quant1__ employers of record of an unemployed individual contribute to their unemployment benefits ....
but we have heard the words " greedy " and " fat cats " and " unethical " come out of his mouth when referring to business owners .
and the same point holds true about cap and trade .
my sources are my clients .
i am their business planner @/@ human resource solutions consultant .
i know what held them back for the __value1__ __quant1__ years of __name1__ 's tenure..
and i know why some are loosening up now and doing what they can to hire .
many of them are n't against __name1__ ...
many like his social initiatives .
but none of them feel good about him as it pertains to their business .
not a single one of them does .
is he not right about the risk of starting a business ?
local ordinances have nothing to do with __name1__ .
if he was renting he could have relocated and avoided the whole thing .
i didnt say it had anything to do with __name1__ .
i was talking about how regulations have an adverse affect on cpompanies desire to grow .
he owned .
if he had rented he was beholden to a legal contract known as a lease ....
and he could not have simply moved ...
and it wopuldnt have been his responsibility to expand the loading bay ...
such would be the responsibility of the property owner per conditions in the lease .
i am confused ...
you are an employer who just gave __value1__ % raises to all of your employees ...
but you are not aware of the legal obligations of a lease and who would be responsible for the adherence to local ordanances ?
how is that possible ?
whether you own or lease , any business owner with a warehouse would know who is repsponsible for what as it pertains to physical property legally required alterations .
if he had __quant1__ months to do it and he was leasing he could have easily relocated .
starting a business has some risks ....
you can eliminate most of them with a sound business plan ....
but you can not control things like weather , natural disasters , and other factors that may affect you at the most critical time ...
your __value1__ year .
but even if you have a sound business plan ...
and one that allows for the survival of a slow time .....
a business owner can not predict what __name1__ and the president may decide ...
thus why we ( bunsiness owners ) get really pissed off at inititaitves that are brought up in __name1__ and addressed for years ...
for it doesnt allow us to forecast properly..
like cap and trade .
will it happen ?
who knows .
can it ?
hell yeah ...
there is already an exchange ready to go to handle it ...
will it affect cmpanies ?
heck ...
hundreds iof not thousands will go under within __quant1__ year ....
so as a result ....
many are assuming it will go through and thus are amassing as much capital as possible now to use to buy its carbon shares when it passes ......
and all at the expense of growing now .
and if it doesnt pass ?
then they wilkl grow when word comes out that it will not pass ...
until then ?
wait , see and hoard cash .
but you said your clients were loosening up and starting to hire again .
that means the economical outlook is good ?
unemployment rates are a lagging economic indicator .
if your clients are starting to hire again , that means recovery has been happening for a number of months now .
how about the forced closing of all those automobile dealerships .
he actually stole people 's livelihood..
so say those that ruined it .
__name1__ took over after __year1__ .
and yes they did a mighty fine job driving us into the ditch .
if __name1__ @/@ __name2__ were doing such outstanding employment numbers where did those jobs go ?
was it a repeat performance of __name1__ bank fraud under __name2__ @/@ __name3__ that wrecked the economy then the job market ?
i thought __name1__ was responsible like you guys claim they are now ?
make up your minds .
dealers for the most part are n't union employees hence he did n't care .
it would probably help if supposed business owners would actually work instead of posting on internet message boards .
but feel free to continue blaming __name1__ for your failures .
useless dribble from a useless skank
you 're not a useless skank ...
you 're good for laughs .
i guess the whole " ignore " thing did n't work out .
gee , you can n't run your business ....
little wonder you can n't master an " ignore " button .
lol
i own you .
oh please ...
__name1__ 's shut down of the gulf oil platforms cost the region well over 100,000 jobs and caused businesses to either slow their output dramatically or shut down .
many of those jobs are not coming back .
the other issue is how __name1__ 's supporters can get beyond this tragic statement .....
__value1__ % unemployment is the new norm "...
bs @- and did you forget the crony oil disaster that __name1__ handled perfectly ?
boom and bust , scandalous polluters ...
idiocy ...
__value1__ , i think i 'd learn how to spell " lemonade ".
the entire uncertainty argument is bullshit .
could you drop the pig __name1__ and try __name2__ ?
no it isn't...
what the op stated is __value1__ % true .
as a matter of fact , this is an example of precisely why many businesses refuse to expand and many others are not opening .
there is no denying this .
there is no factual rebuttal .
bs . __value1__ % of the uncertainty is caused by fear mongering and gov't disfunction from pubs and their gigantic propaganda machine .
" no compromise un @-@ american __name1__ " ( __name2__ mag ) no reward for those aholes ....
yes __name1__ ...
if you would only return to electing more __name1__ we could return to the business environment of __year1__ @-@ __year2__ where we were losing __quant1__ jobs __quant2__ month .
that is how much confidence business had in __name1__
__name1__ had control then .
i prefer we do n't return to that scenario .
after all they were warned and just ignored it .
no thanks
my gawd , you have to be a real dummy to not think strangling regulations on a company does n't hurt..
the new __name1__ @/@ wingnut talking point , now that blaming the bad economy on __name2__ is n't going to work anymore :
the economy is recovering in spite of __name1__ , not because of him .
this is about the __value1__ th time i 've heard this today already ...
those goalposts must be pretty heavy , ya think ?
__year1__ @-@ __year2__ is when __name1__ were in charge .
they had all the power .
during that time they destroyed a lot of jobs .
yep , because us __name1__ supporters are just going to write him in anyway and the __name2__ establishment would rather put another spend @-@ whore liberal republican or warmonger against __name3__ .
grats __name1__ .
that is all .
__name1__ can always run third party if he wants to .
but __name1__ will probably win because you have to have a really compelling reason to vote out an incumbant , and the __name2__ has n't given one yet .
try his economic disaster .
the __value1__ 2 __value1__ @/@ 2 years he had a __name2__ __name1__ and he could have done anything he wanted to and he did .
problem with that argument is
1 ) the economy is finally starting to improve .
2 ) the __name1__ could be held to blame just as much as he can .
thats right .
the __name1__ had better get in line with the living breathing walking and talking human beings instead of the money sucking __quant1__ principal profit worshiping fake fucks .
so had the __name1__ , in all honesty .
all the recent talk about __name1__ engaging in class warfare against the rich makes me laugh ...
and it makes me angry .
the rich in this country have n't had it so good since the gilded age .
i 'm not just talking about accumulated wealth .
i 'm talking about having special rights that the rest of us , whether liberal or conservative , do n't have .
here 's a case in point :
in __month1__ __year1__ , martin joel erzinger , a $ __quant1__ hedge fund manager working for __name1__ , was driving his __name2__ near __name3__ , co when he hit a bicyclist from behind , seriously injuring him .
then he sped away without stopping , without calling the police or calling for an ambulance .
he did , however , stop some time later ...
to call the __name1__ auto assistance service to report damage to his vehicle and have it towed .
erzinger committed __quant2__ felonies but was only charged for __quant1__ misdemeanors because da hulbert said charging him with felonies would negatively affect his career .
is that right ?
would n't that be the same for anyone ?
i mean , if you or i had committed the same crime , would it negatively affect our careers to be charged with __quant1__ felonies .
after all , people do go to jail for such things .
and people lose their jobs when they go to jail , right ?
you can read about the case below .
<a href="http://www.summitdaily.com/article/20101108/news/101109802/1078&parentprofile=1055"> da hurlbert won't press felony charges against hit @-@ and @-@ run driver because it might affect his job | summitdaily.com </a>
in __year1__ , the prison population in the __name1__ was about 190,000 people .
in __year1__ , the __name1__ had __quant1__ people in prison .
today , __name1__ estimates that number stands at around 2.4 million people .
that means that today , there are 12.5 times as many people in prison then just __quant1__ years ago .
from which class of people do you think our gov't is sending to prison ?
ask yourself this question !
has anyone involved in the financial meltdown of __year1__ gone to prision ?
to trial ?
has there even been any criminal investigation ?
how about when the __name1__ administration broke the law and engaged in warrantless wiretaps .
they broke the law ?
any consequences ?
the telecom companies also broke the law .
__name1__ gave them retroactive immunity .
remember __name1__ ?
__name1__ __value1__ pardoned __quant1__ __name2__ administration officials .
__name1__ issued a pardon to __name2__ , a former __name3__ agent , who had authorized the break @-@ ins of homes on __quant1__ separate occasions in a search for evidence against suspected __name4__ members .
they broke into their families homes , as well .
of course , everyone remembers __name1__ 's pardon of __name2__ .
it might interest everyone to know that __name1__ just convicted __name2__ , the former president of france , for corruption .
what happened to __name1__ being a nation of laws and not men ?
today , i guess the powerful do n't need pardons .
that 's because they 're not prosecuted .
there 's no plea bargain because they 're not even charged with a crime .
there 's not even an investigation .
there 's your class warfare .
nowadays , the rich and powerful rarely get charged with serious crimes .
but if they do get charged , they get pardoned for their crimes .
or maybe just a commutation of sentence like for __name1__ .
and what happens to the ' lower classes ' who do n't have powerful friends or a lot of money ?
our gov't throws the book at them , and they get longer and longer prision sentences for ever more minor offenses and victimless crimes .
that 's why the __name1__ has the largest prison population in the world , in both numbers , and as a percentage of the population .
for example , __name1__ , with a population of __quant1__ people only has a prison population of __quant2__ .
the __name1__ , with less than __value1__ % of their population , has 700,000 more people in jail .
so , please stop trying to make everyone feel pity for the wealthy in this country who are richer than ever and are paying a lower tax rate than they have in __quant1__ .
that 's not where the class warfare problem exists .
it exists on the other end of the spectrum .
but if you do n't believe me , if you ever get in trouble with the law , try telling a da that a criminal conviction would hurt your career .
see how far that gets you .
a very clear miscarriage of justice .
i wonder how much the da cost to be bought off .
__quant1__ ?
two ?
ten ?
whatever the amount was , i hope he sold his soul and his ethics for a high amount .
that case is only one example of a systemic problem that pervades the entire criminal justice system .
hell , i did n't even mention the fact that rich people can afford better legal counsel .
after all , do you think __name1__ would have gotten away with murder in the 90 's without his ' dream team '?
i agree on the miscarriage of justice .
laws should be for everyone .
__name1__ was n't alone .
__name1__ murdered his wife and walked .
__name1__ walked the __value1__ time .
in __name1__ , we have a clause , " not guilty by reason of celebrity ."
for the record : there is no ' class ' in the __name1__ .
it is not a class based society .
' class warfare ' is what politicians use to divide __name1__ from each other - because that makes it easier for them to rob us all .
only fucking morons support __name2__ or __name2__ .
you people are the problem .
you 're confusing the word , " class , " with the word , " caste , "
we do n't have a caste system like __name1__ ( or __name2__ , to a lesser extent ) .
but we do have a class system .
money and power are the usual determinants .
it is far more likely that a poor person committing a crime will be convicted , but there 's a lot more to the issue than just convictions .
a wealthy person is less likely to be charged .
if he is , then he will have better lawyers .
if convicted , he will get a lighter sentence .
once in prison , he more likely to be paroled .
this is nothing new .
yep , and in the worst case buy a presidential pardon .
california girl is correct .
we do n't have a class sytem yet .
that carries major implications within society .
if you are of the upper class in __name1__ ( whether you are rich or not ) there are doors open to you that no amount of money will buy entry into .
the same holds true for __name1__ as well .
here in the __name1__ you can buy entry through any door you see .
i am sorry for this news to you but this has been the case since ...
well , mankind got ' organized '.
who wrote " all animals are equal , but some animals are more equal than others , " and when did he write it ?
justice is sometimes a matter of simply , what you can afford .
it has always been so .
<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/business/martin-erzinger-morgan-stanley-hit-run-controversy/story?id=12088074"> martin __name1__ morgan stanley __value1__ 's hit @-@ __value1__ run __name2__ abc news </a>
here is another link to the story .
according to this the __quant1__ misdemeanors are due to a plea deal , and the guy is pleading guilty to it .
furthermore it is his __value1__ offense , and no drugs or alcohol were involved .
in most juristictions if it is your __value1__ offense you can usually get anything below attempted murder or rape plead down to a lesser charge .
also , now that he has plead guilty the victim can sue the living shit out of him .
that is where the more well off can get slammed by the system .
there will be __quant1__ lawyers willing to take this case , and a deal won't come cheap for the driver .
if you also read down , the whole thing about not affecting his livelyhood is explained as making sure he can still afford resitution .
not when someone is seriously injured .
that places it into a whole new level .
my assumption is the scumbag paid a huge anmount to the victim so that he would be ok with the reduced charges , then said scumbag paid a large amount to the da 's re @-@ election campaign and there you have it .
justice is served ...
or sauteed if you prefer .
this thread is devolving into the usual " rape the rich " bullshit from the mindless left .
that 's too bad , because mustang touched upon an interesting subject in the op.
we do have a disparity of " justice " in this nation , a severe one .
the well connected are virtually immune to our laws , __name1__ was as bad or worse that __name2__ , but a quick bribe to __name3__ ensured that he was immune from prosecution for his crimes .
<a __name1__ marc rich case : a __name2__ - time </a>
__name1__ murdered a girl who was pregnant , assumable with his child , but then , paternity tests were never run , due to his " status " he was never prosecuted .
__name1__ openly threatened __name2__ that if she did not perjure herself he would fire her and ensure she lost her pension .
but since he is a powerful democrat , he got away with it .
time and again we see that there is __quant2__ set of laws for the well connected , and a vastly different set for the commoners .
and it is n't just being able to afford high end attorneys .
__name1__ was never criminally charged with witness tampering and racketeering , though absolutely proven guilty , it 's on tape .
__name1__ was never charged with murder , though it 's irrefutable that he did murder __name2__ .
back room deals are cut to keep the well connected from even facing a court room .
no need for lawyers because the strings are pulled so that they are n't ever charged in the first place .
this nation was founded on the principle of law , yet we see that this is n't what we have .
partisans cheer the subversion of the law because " their team " got away with it , and they care only about their party , not justice .
the justice system is a farce and we all know it .
corruption is the rule , not the exception .
even at the municipal level the very concept of justice is perverted .
we have traffic laws that exist for no reason other than to fine motorists .
if a man with a gun targets a person purely for revenue , what can we call this other than armed robbery ?
all the way up the chain this goes , judges handing out long sentences to ensure that the prison guard union has plenty of work , in return for donations to keep the judge in office .
in __name1__ a woman got a ticket for talking on her cell phone .
the law said it was a $ __quant1__ fine .
so she was fined $ __quant1__ , then assessed a $ __quant2__ processing fee , then an $ __quant3__ court fee .
so was this upholding the law , or just armed robbery ?
our justice system is rotten to the core , so what are we going to do about it ?
play " rape the rich " games because that 's what __name1__ wants ?
should we be occupied with envy and greed like the shitters , demanding more for unions and illegals , or should we really look at the shambles our injustice system is in ?
c'mon .
if you guys were riding with us up here in __value1__ class rather than back there in steerage , you 'd take advantage of your status too .
[ quote=mustang ; 4545988 ]
i think you 're missing the entire point .
the founding fathers understood that there would be inequality .
and as is often said , they were n't trying to make everyone equal .
however , they did strive to make everyone equal under the law .
they also understood that equal opportunity was paramount , and , equal outcome would not and should not ever be assured .
the purpose of this thread is two @-@ fold .
__value1__ , it 's to dismiss the orchestrated idea that the wealthy in this country are somehow ' victims ' of class warfare when talk is floated of raising their taxes to help tackle the deficit and debt at the very same time that massive cuts are on the horizon to tackle the same deficit and debt .
__value1__ , it 's to show that the real class warfare that exists in this country in the criminal justice system actually works in favor of the wealthy and well @-@ connected at the expense of the poor and the middle class .
our country is supposed to be a nation of laws and not men , right ?
then why is it that our political and financial elites get pardons for their crimes or their crimes are n't even investigated when a country like __name1__ does n't have a problem putting their former president on trial for corruption ?
if our collective ideals are to have any real meaning at all , then we have to practice what we preach to others , and it 's clear that we as a nation are not doing that .
when __name1__ pardoned __name2__ , i think everyone believed ( or at least hoped ) that __name2__ 's pardon was a one time exception .
unfortunately , all it seemed to do is set a precedent for future pardons .
what is also unfortunate , is that while our justice system has become ever more lenient toward the rich and powerful , it 's has also become increasingly merciless to the poor and the middle class because as i noted in the op , the __name1__ has 12.5 times as many people in prison today as we had in prison __quant1__ years ago .
and our population has n't increased by over a factor of 10 in the last __quant1__ generations .
you can do a lot with numbers as presented the way you did .
you are assuming that becasue there is more people in jail now , than there was __quant1__ years ago it is due to some mass scale of injustice .
can you relate to me how that is , exactly ?
that is the state of class warfare in our society .
the rich are n't victims ; they 're beneficiaries in every sense of the definition .
when a person makes an issue of the earning power and riches of another , absent particular crimes used to amass such , in a society that is upwardly mobile that provides the same playing field for all , what is it then ?
who is stopping others from becoming the beneficiary of same ?
[ quote=trajan ; 4550118 ]
do you know the great thing about numbers .
they do n't lie .
however , it 's the interpretation of the numbers that matters .
if crime had gone up by __value1__ % in __quant1__ years , that could account for the higher prison numbers .
and if the population of the __name1__ had risen by the same percentage , that would also explain the increase in the number of people in prision .
neithe of those things is true .
and no combination of a higher population and an increase of the crime rate can account for those numbers .
so , it 's something else , is n't it ?
perhaps you would care to offer an alternate theory .
i still have n't heard any suggestions for a better system .
unfortunately the corruption in government is so deeply imbedded it will take a revolution to rip it out .
but the new rulers are tactful enough at their game to maintain sufficient balance in wealth and privilege distribution within the lower class that the spark of revolution remains too cool to start the necesary fire .
there is at least one __name1__ for every four or five prospective revolutionaries .
and a lot of those __name1__ participate right here in this forum .
also , the __name1__ bill presently being floored will , if passed , effectively eliminate __name2__ and __name3__ .
and while __name1__ had promised to veto the bill he recently withdrew that promise .
( i am now totally disgusted with that phony sonofabitch .)
the bill will enable the military to detain for an indefinite period , without formal charges or an arraignment hearing , anyone suspected of " terrorism , " whatever that means .
based on what we 've already seen it 's not hard to foresee it being applied to something like publicly saying , " i 'm fed up with this goddam government and i think we need to do something to change it ! "
" terrorism ."
well , we can certainly guess what is not considered " terrorism " by this administration :
__name1__ __value1__ calls __value1__ hood shooting ' workplace violence __value1__ - __value1__ hood __name3__ fox nation </a>
pols get to walk all the time .
krist just look at the record of anyone in __name1__ .
i 'd bet at least __value1__ percent should be in jail .
as wrong as this is , please recall , __name1__ killed a woman and __name2__ executed a citizen w/o a trial .
and no one said or will say shit about it .
regarding the comment : " rape the rich " from the mindless left .
let me see if i understand your point of view .
wealth and power are in fact concentrated to a decreasing number of people ;
not really .
the the population in the top __value1__ % , __value2__ % and __value3__ % of income earners has stayed pretty static relative to total population since __year1__ .
yes , i oppose corruption .
i have no issue with wealth .
the more wealth created , the better .
i support wealth and oppose corruption .
i 'm the opposite of the __name1__ , i suppose , who oppose wealth and favor corruption .
however , you find it inanely absurd ( to the point that it is mindless ) to think that the same wealth @/@ power is not used to manipulate the law making process , tax code , or financial institutions .
is that accurate ?
again , the issue is one of corruption .
equal justice under the law is the foundation of this nation .
we have lost that , we have distinctly different laws for the well connected than we do for the common people .
wealth and power often go hand in hand , in the case of the clintons , the wealth is a by @-@ product of political power .
it is the connections that pervert the law though , not the wealth .
simply put , i believe that __name1__ should be held to the same law that tyrone jackson in __name2__ is - and i do n't think you can argue that he is .
i take offense when you call people mindless who would take your very logic , and say " has all wealth and power in this country been earned by the people who wield it ."
the answer is no.
people love the __name1__ of this country and have no problem with them .
coincidentally , most wealthy people who earn their wealth ( like him ) claim that they do n't carry the public burden on a fair level .
the point of those " mindless " people you accuse , is that much of that wealth and power has been accumulated through corruption and exploitation .
__quant1__ concepts that led our country to rebel in the __value1__ place ( see taxation without representation ) .
the same thing is happening now on a more convoluted level with lobbyists ( powerful ) writing our laws and tax code .
your logic is somewhat confusing to me is all i 'm saying .
i do n't think __name1__ hate rich .
they just do n't like being lied to , cheated , deceived , and exploited .
in the very same way that takes place in our justice system .
who would n't want to be rich beyond their wildest dreams ?
the conservative misconception is that liberals hate money .
it 's not the money liberals hate ....
it 's the devious means in which some of the rich people obtain their wealth .
[ quote=mustang ; 4550209 ]
that 's easy - the asinine war on drugs .
a huge section of that prison populous was put there on drug charges .
a crime that is essentially hurting no one but yourself .
i do n't think that the wealthy are ' victims ' of class warfare and i do n't think that was ever the intent on using that phrase .
it is the poor that are victimized by politicians that pit them against the rich .
the rich are not going to notice the __value2__ percent that is taken from them in the name of the poor but in reality , nether are the poor going to notice it given to them .
it creates a death spiral of take more and more without really noticing that they are getting nowhere and accomplishing nothing .
the rich are never going to be the victim but the poor are being exploited by the politicians to take the ire from them and move it to a source of income for them to spend .
as far as uneven legal representation , that is a big deal and i am not sure how to further mitigate the problem .
if people were really outraged by this it would change on its own but the fact is that people in general are apathetic morons and simply do not care .
look at the pass people gave __name1__ .
even here people were making arguments for him .
somehow , people see famous different than the normal guy .
a better jury set for starters and possibly a blind da .
one that makes the decition to hear a case without names involved or any other information other than the facts uncovered so far .
that would be hard to do though .
heh , they would have to serve __quant1__ year in a closed bunker just to get away from the news reports but hey , the military already does that and they would not even be shot at
my favorite stories are the ones where public officials , or secretaries embezzle thousands and into the hundreds of thousands .
when caught , they get probation and restitution and /or maybe __quant1__ year in the county .
steel something from __name1__ and see what happens .

financial " success " is n't a good thing if it comes from __name1__ speculation or if you obtain it by accepting bribes from speculators .
a wall between private wealth and the state is long overdue ; however , i doubt elected __name1__ or __name2__ would agree .

in the last __quant1__ decades or so , income inequality has been growing .
while wages are being driven down for a number of reasons , corporate executives are taking ever larger pay and benefit packages , even when they drive their respective companies into the ditch .
now , here 's a question that i would like someone to seriously try to answer : why is it that talking about income inequality qualifies as class warfare against the rich , but income inequality , itself , is n't considered class warfare against the poor and middle classes ?
possibly because for __quant1__ of years the richest members of any society , those who loan money at interest , have consolidated government 's power for their own selfish ends .
even the __name1__ did n't change that dynamic very much ; central bankers do n't really have to worry about who 's elected to office as long as the private creation and allocation of credit remains safely in their hands .
__name1__ has already launched the class war into the consciousness of millions of __name2__ .
events coming up next summer at the __name1__ and __name2__ conventions could provoke your question onto the public stage during the closing months of a __name3__ presidential campaign .
if the __name3__ economy is swirling the same drain in __year2__ as it was in __year1__ millions of voters , whose ranks may be swelled by additional millions of eligible voters who do n't usually bother casting a ballot , might decide a " choice " between __name1__ or __name2__ is really no choice at all when it comes to class war .

oh my garsh !

that 's not class warfare by any stretch of the imagination .
__name1__ barack __name2__ __value1__ again top most admired list </a>
i find this fascinating .
__name1__ 's approval ratings are hovering below __value1__ % , yet he has made the list for the __quant1__ th year in a row .
to me , this says that __name1__ are willing to give __name2__ the benefit of the doubt in __year1__ .
once his re @-@ election campaign is in full gear , his accomplishments will come into the light ( his failures have been made all too apparent by __name1__ .)
perhaps they are starting to realize that the president is n't a cure @-@ all for a damaged economy .
they understand that that there are many other factors to be considered ( i.e . the politics of __name1__ ) .
that , of course , is just my opinion .
and an opinion based on very little meaningful analysis it is .
the poll asked about 1000 people who they admired the most : about 170 said " __name1__ ."
that means __quant1__ admired someone else .
no kidding ...
you do understand the concept of representable samples , right ?
what i find fascinating is..
__name1__ came in __value1__ , and __name2__ came in second..
so because __name1__ made most admired guy that means the people are going to give him the benefit of doubt..
it was n't a poll on which president you admired the most ...
good grief
he 's at the top of the list for the __quant1__ th year in a row .
obviously him being president has something to do with it .
then you birds got nuttin to worry about..
right ?
that 's right .
of course he is .
hes a good family man and has been a below average president .
hes a very likable guy and he has my vote .
not one __name1__ member can come close to his family values , which is overly ironic at best .
the guy is easy to like and respect , except if you are not of an open mind .
it helps that the media has n't given him the same anal @-@ probing the __name1__ field has gotten .
__name1__ ill was extremely popular in his country .
thousands were literally bawling at his funeral .
just goes to show you what good press can do for a poor leader .
about __value1__ % of those polled said ' someone else ', and not __name1__ .
you do understand the concept of math , right ?
blame them not me for that .
see that dot way up there in the sky ?
it 's my point , sailing over your head .
oh , i got your point .
out of that list , they picked the best .
no , you missed @/@ purposely ignored the point .
from that list __value1__ % said someone other than __name1__ .
good..
it 's nice to be surprised innit ?
you do realize this is nothing more than a popularity contest right ?
just look at the names on the list .
there are far better people that should be on there , the __name1__ recipients for starters ) .
these names are just those that are the most familiar at the moment .
this is __quant1__ of the problems with this country .
the " __name1__ " mentality too many people have .
anybody who admires those __quant1__ fools are idiots , not just saying , they truly are .
it does n't speak well for our country when it 's __quant1__ shady politicians that is the most admired..
sad
i would be willing to bet if the question was " which politician is your least favorite " __name1__ would be close to the top .
__name2__ was polled as the most admired woman in __name1__ several years ago , around the same time __value1__ % of voters said they would never vote for her .
what does that prove ? ??
it mostly has to do with name recognition and media coverage .
if that were the case , i 'd also be willing to bet that billy would be the one using my argument
i would be willing to bet if the question was " which politician is your least favorite " oboes would be close to the top .
if that were the case , i 'd also be willing to bet that billy would be the one using my argument :roll :
probably , but in a more reactionary as opposed to cerebral manner .
those __quant1__ are the most popular ? ?
who the hell did they ask ? ?

no kidding ...
gee .....

you must really dazzle ' em , at your local elementary school playgrounds ! !!
yeh ... ?
was i speaking too fast ?
man , the media fluffery machine is already in overdrive for boiking and his little neo @-@ __name1__ glee club .
try to pay attention :
the respondents to the poll were not given a list .
they were simply asked to name whoever thay admired the most :
what man that you have heard or read about , living today in any part of the world , do you admire most ?
and who is your __value1__ choice ?
almost __value1__ % chose someone that did n't even accumulate __quant1__ votes ( their dog , their cat , their dildo ....
whatever ) .
most interesting to me was that the __year1__ poll had the highest number or respondents say , " none " during the past decade ...
__value1__ % .
lol , nothing like ignoring the real polls ...
so __name1__ is going to gain momentum ?
well , where did it go in the __value1__ place ?
i guess he has n't given enough t.v interviews or taken enough bus trips to campaign on our dime .
where do you get this information from that __name1__ uses tax payer money to do interviews and bus trips ?
he has campaign money , you know .
that 's what it is used for .
every time __name1__ goes anywhere it cost taxpayers money .
if his campaign tried to cover all the costs they would run out of money in __quant1__ week .
think about this .
it is n't hard .
__name1__ has topped the list __quant1__ years in a row .
each time they 've used about 1000 people .
do you really think the same people have answered each year ?
no , they have not .
they make sure to use random samples each time .
no , but it does seem difficult for you to compare __year1__ with today .
in __year1__ , __name1__ won the poll with __value1__ %
today he won the poll with __value1__ %
based on the trend in random sampling , it does n't look good for __name1__ winning an election in __month1__ __year1__ .
next time do n't bring a butter knife to a gunfight .
it does look good actually .
he is even with __name1__ in most national polls and has a slight lead in some of them .
from here , he is only going to gain momentum .
i though we were talking about the astonishing drop in __name1__ 's popularity since he became president ?
now you 're talking about someone named " __name1__ " who is even with __name2__ ?
are you capable of staying on topic within your own threads ?
no , you are n't .
and quite frankly , i cannot blame you for wanting to change the subject : even i am feeling embarassed for you ....
come on , now you are arguing for the sake of arguing .
you can feel anything you want .
i 'm not the one overreaching .
the porn movie reference is quite appropriate .
the __name1__ party has always fought for the working man & woman .
always ?
the __name1__ party was also the party that fought for slavery .
of course , they did n't think slaves were actually humans , so you may still be correct in your statement .
actually , __name1__ itself is the biggest contributor to our debt .
the wars certainly do n't help our financial situation but you do realize the your __name1__ president has started a few wars of his own , all unfunded and undeclared by __name2__ ?
the __name1__ tax cuts should have been repealed to help pay and we would n't be in this mess
actually , tax revenues as a percentage of gdp changes very little over time , even as marginal tax rates vary widely .
there is no evidence to suggest that if we had higher tax rates ( no " __name1__ tax cuts ") that we would have realized more actual revenue .
in fact , a strong case can be made that we have realized more revenue do to those cuts .
either scenario is difficult to prove but we certainly know that your statement cannot be proven .
and by the way , you do understand that __name1__ cut taxes for all __name2__ , not just the wealthy , right ?
the last __quant1__ points are just flat wrong and we all know it but i have a question for all the pubs @/@ bags -
why do you think using ancient history is germane to your modern day point ?
pretty dumb , actually .
ah , the smart guy shares his superior intellect !
yet he offers nothing to support his points .
interesting .
wrong .
i have no idea why the facts are so hard for con @-@ wanabes to understand , but here it is again .
there 's even a nice picture for you to look at .
<a href="http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3036"> critics still wrong on what </a>
ah , the dumb guy offers nothing to support his position because he can n't .
are you going to answer my question or are you going to blow smoke ?
never mind .
i know you won't because you can n't and i 've got to leave anyway .
enjoy the proof i posted in my link .
oh that 's rich !
i love it !
you link to a prediction of deficits in the __quant1__ to come .
let 's deal with reality , shall we ?
for __year1__ , the largest budget items broke down as follows : · __value2__ % defense and security · __value1__ % __name1__ · __value3__ % safety net programs · ...
and look at this __value1__ % for __name1__ , medicade and __name2__ .
looks like we spend more on __name1__ than anything else .
ergo , that 's the program that most contributes to debt .
really not that hard to understand ...
still waiting for that proof .
regarding the past as an indicator of what we might expect in the future , i choose to understand history .
you are free to repeat it .
you got __name1__ down pat .
its all bushs fault .
youre a true idiot if you think __name1__ is for the working people while he is in a __quant1__ dollar house in hi
well , it 's partly the president 's fault for not kicking teatard butt so that the __name1__ tax cuts were allowed to expire as they were supposed to .
but good you have your talking points !
you really need to change your nic ...
the word __value1__ in it is just hilarious
the last time tax receipts as a percentage of gdp were below __value1__ % was in __year1__ when they dropped to __value2__ % .
the last time they were below __value1__ % was in __year1__ and __year2__ when they were __value2__ % and __value3__ % .
to claim " since __name1__ , tax revenues have stayed within __value1__ to __value2__ percent of gdp " is completely false and utterly dishonest .
it is more honest and accurate to say receipts average between __value1__ % @-@ __value3__ % , and in the 90 's were in the high 19s and hit __value2__ by the end .
however you phrase it , we have not seen tax receipts this low as a percentage of gdp since the end of __name1__ .
that is a fact .
additionally , you are utterly wrong about __name1__ and __name2__ .
from __year1__ @-@ 82 , by no means economic boom years , receipts never dipped below __value1__ % of gdp . from __year2__ @-@ __year3__ , they never went above __value2__ % !
just like with the __name1__ tax cuts , tax receipts went down not up .
lastly , i am amazed by your spin on the fact that half of __name1__ do n't pay federal income tax .
if that is n't proof that taxes are their lowest in generations , i do n't know what else to tell you .
you 're simply ignoring reality and history .
i am not in any way amazed by your spin on facts ...
i 've come to expect it .
nevertheless , let 's take ' em __quant1__ at a time :
1 ) glad we agree that all __name1__ should pay an income tax .
chalk one up for bipartisan support .
2 ) regan 's tax rates included both increases and decreases and were not fully implemented until __year1__ .
and what do you know , receipts stayed about the same .
amazing , is n't it ? !
the people has less taken out of their pockets but the government still got its revenue .
and yes , we stayed within that traditional __value1__ @-@ __value2__ percent range .
3 ) so you 're saying i lied because since __name1__ , we saw __value1__ % in __year1__ , which is n't technically __value2__ % .
you got me .
mia culpa .
but hey , at the end of the day , i 'm sure your degree in economics and experience in the field outpaces that of __name1__ ...
i 'm sure .
1 ) we do agree on this point .
however , i 'm sure we disagree on how to go about it .
for the record , i am in favour of raising wages before we raise taxes on the working class .
2 ) again , no.
you are ignoring history .
after __year1__ tax receipts dropped to below __value1__ % and did not rise above that level until __year2__ !
in fact , in __year1__ , receipts were __value1__ % and in __year2__ they were __value2__ % .
that 's a substantial drop that you are choosing to ignore .
why is that ?
oh right , because ...
3 ) you are arbitrarily picking a range .
you 've decided to use __value1__ % @-@ __value4__ % , even though since __name1__ , there are only a couple instances of levels as low as __value3__ % or as high as __value2__ % .
if you were being honest , which you are n't , you would use the average and __quant1__ standard deviation , which would get you a range of __value1__ % @-@ __value2__ % ( __value3__ % being the average ) .
using that range , you would see we are currently way outside the norm .
as for your hero __name1__ , you know he drew his famous curve on a napkin as a joke , right ?
it was never meant to be taken seriously .
but , since you are taking it seriously , the least you could do is be honest with yourself .
the __name1__ is a curve .
which means on the left side as tax rates drop so do tax revenue levels .
that 's what __name1__ was saying and that 's what you are choosing to ignore .
whether you like it or not , we are on the left side of the __name1__ .

raising wages ?
and who does that ?
government or the guys that actually own the business ?
that is not a " substantial drop "!
it is a fluctuation that cannot be attributed to any __quant1__ specific tax change ...
and there were changes in rates both up and down .
you 've not supported your point at all .
bottom line , we took less in taxes and revenues stay about the same ...
which has been the case for __quant1__ years now when rates go down or up .
pick whatever range you want .
you have no evidence that marginal rate changes have a direct correlation to changes in revenue .
sorry , you just do n't .
i understand the __name1__ and yes , we are on the left side of that curve , exactly as __name2__ would have predicted in an economic downturn .
you can bitch all you want about tax rates .
there are a hell of a lot of us that are done with the idea of tweaking rates for the benefit of some and the detriment of others .
we want a flat , fair and wide base and most importantly , for the government to live within it 's means .
deal with it at the ballot box .
says a birther , shut up .
you clearly have no idea what you 're talking about .
__value1__ % has been the average since __name1__ .
__quant1__ standard deviation below that is __value1__ % .
__quant1__ standard deviations below that is __value1__ % and we are even below that !
yet , you think this is normal and fine ?
that this is within the acceptable range ?
a range you just made up ?
apparently someone flunked his college stats class .
when we were over by __quant1__ standard deviations , __name1__ went on tv crying over how the government was taking in too much money and had to give it back .
now we 're on the other side the same way ...
and you do n't care .
you choose to ignore it like every other " conservative ".
way to go .
you do n't understand the __name1__ .
it does n't change based on the strength of the economy .
do some reading .
your ignorance is showing .
i know ...
__quant1__ of the stupider , nastier rightwingnuts on the board ....
but she 's got loooooooooove .
lol..
who gets her money through a socialistic structure..
i hope you are right as my daughter hates her job and i would like to see her find another .
companies have been holding cash for a while now and without demand , there is no need to hire .
they are making a profit without new employees .
other bad signs for the economy are :
-@ the downward adjusted housing numbers · -@ paltry gdp numbers · -@ real unemployment rate
good news though include :
-@ consumer confidence is up · -@ durable goods numbers up
what this great country needs now is the __quant1__ sides to stop pushing agenda items and start making decisions that make economical sense .
your daughter should start looking now .
tell her to get a good resume together and start submitting them online .
having a job is easier then not having one when looking .
employers like hiring people away from other firms .
first..
it 's almost a seamless transition and second , if it 's a rival then all the better .
and the " profits " they are making are accounting tricks .
it does n't last forever .
and really , it 's them that started the loss of demand .
for __quant1__ reasons .
they wanted to cut high labor costs by hiring overseas and creating a glut of people looking for work .
initially layoffs had nothing to do with loss of demand .
it was " synergy ".
eventually..
that 's what started to happen , because ue got so high .
but now..
even the __name1__ factories are in trouble because people are not buying their cheap crap .
thus , people are starting to look for government solutions to the problem .
and quite frankly , alot of things need to be done .
infrastructure , implementing new tech like cloud and __name1__ , and high speed rail .
however..
that could tighten the high tech @/@ engineer market again .
which would be bad for alot of these companies .
which is __quant1__ reason __quant1__ think a hiring boom will happen .
what better time to snap up well trained peeps who 've been out of work for awhile .
and they get them on the cheap , while looking like " heroes ".
in other words - sallow is hoping for another mass bailout and enormous government spending .
but no worries ...
__name1__ wants to cut 3 $trillion out of the deficit in __quant1__ years ( which will of course increase the deficit not decrease it )
will do , thanks for the advice .
these are just musings..
but lately there 's been alot of frenzied activity from recruiters .
and __quant1__ just went to the office party of my old job and while talking to some of the guys there , many people who were looking for __quant1__ year or more are getting snapped up .
what 's going on ?
well aside from the economy getting better , the __name1__ tax cuts are set to expire .
and there 's not much evidence they did anything to help .
employers are sitting on tons and tons of liquidity and playing " shell games " to keep making money..
without adding to the overall economy .
given the present anger in the public at large , i have a feeling that to quell some of this..
there will be a hiring boom .
who knows ...
i do n't think you 'll see a " hiring boom " till after the __year1__ elections and that would depend greatly on the outcome .
of course you think that willow .
tell us when the last time you were right in a prediction ?
we 'll have to wait and see won't we dog breath .
you have made them before , did you ever get one right ?
actually..
some states are doing what the __name1__ won't..
and adding stimulus .
__name1__ state just wrapped up a huge deal with cornell..
<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/cornell-wins-bloombergs-nyc-tech-campus-heres-what-the-2-million-square-foot-school-will-look-like-2011-12"> pictures __name1__ __name2__ technion __value1__ engineering school </a>
and __name1__ kiboshed the idea of killing the millionaire 's tax in favor of putting together a package of infrastructure projects .
and walking around the city you can see construction is booming .
i assume you have noticed that colleges have been in a massive growth boom for the past __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ years .
school construction has never been better .
and who could be surprised ?
we are just now beyond the height of the education bubble created by the government .
and it will burst .
and it will be ugly when it does .
i would think you would not be in favor of this .
__quant1__ would assume you do n't like how tuition has ballooned in the past decade ?
what exactly are you basing this on ?
on another blog several years ago __quant1__ said corporations would n't be hiring for a while for a number of reasons .
-@ they wanted to cut benefits and wages .
-@ they wanted to make the president look bad to loosen regulations or get another guy in office .
that position got slammed..
but it turned out to be pretty true .
they are n't hiring .
but not for the reasons you state .
you imaginarium is running along the paranoid lines .
i 've seen many small business owners interviewed and have listened to many who are members here on this board..
a. thousands of anti business regulations from __name1__
b. __name1__ and the associated costs .
c . uncertainty in an anti business enviornment .
d. they 're not look forward to the expiration of the __name1__ tax cuts .
so , , we 'll wait and see who is right .
a. which ones ?
b. cost of healthcare was rocketing up prior to __name1__ .
employers were asking for more of a contribution from employees .
c. what " anti @-@ business " environment ?
did interest rates suddenly spike ?
several rounds of qe were " anti @-@ business "?
d. read my op.
outstanding point .
and why would an employer hire new employees that he may have to lay off later and then know he 's going to have to pay unemployment benefits for a lifetime ?
who in the hell would knowingly do that ?
please .
stop .
talking .
bullshit and spin .
that all you got ?
no.
ewe stop talking .
has the amount of millionaires and billionaires in this country gone up or down in the past __quant1__ years ?
seriously..
come into the real world .
i hope you are right cause we need a hiring boom , alot of people are out of jobs and need the work .
with that kind of attitude why hire anyone ?
that business would be a __quant1__ man shop .
plus unemployment is hardly a life time , it varies depending on state but there is always an expiration date on that .
what spin ?
i address your points and asked some questions .
point out the " falsehoods "...
if you like .
try using some real world facts to buttress your position .
personally , i am seeing some fairly significant movements in the real estate market .
it appears the stockpile of the foreclosures is finally beginning to disappear .
plus , commercial investors are coming back to the table .
__year1__ may be a year of unexpected recovery .
that 's __name1__ 's cross to bear .
poor him .
like me .
the country producing more millionaires should be celebrated , but that 's jmo .
a company that hires through a temp service .
a temp service always has 2 customers , at least .
one to bring people in for the pay .
and one that just sucks that almost no one will take .
when the big payer ends , the temp co can offer the worker the shitty job , hoping they won't take it , so it 's a voluntary quit and thus no ue>
what kind of work do you do ?
it 's no " bubble ".
the world comes to the __name1__ to educate it 's people .
the __name1__ colleges and universities are top flight..
bar none .
great time to add another fee to those taking out mortgages then .
why ?
i was application support for trading and market data systems .
i also helped build out nocs , rnocs , contigency floors and data centers .

before that i did consulting for application and hardware migrations .

so i am studying to take the certification test .
that..
and i make a really mean omlette !
well ...
for starters .....
if you look anything like your avatar , i think i may know what your problem is and why you cant find a job .
i just copied and pasted your qulifications on a __name1__ doc .
i am going to make some calls to people i kow that do tech and see if your qualificatiuons are something they may be able to present to a client .
if i get any positive repsonse , i will pm you ...
and do something i am very much against doing ...
but would do iot for you ....
give you my personal @/@ business information .
and if i do ...
just an fyi ...
i have a very vicious puggle guarding my house .
hey thanks !
the offer to have you buy me a beer still stands .
who said anything about unemployment for life ?
they keep extending it , , what do you think that means ?
soon there will never be a satisfactory cut off point .
omg ....
there is no way you just denied that education is a bubble market right now .
you did n't .
wow .
i suppose you can call anything a bubble if you like..
and point to things to support your point .
my understanding of a " bubble " is a sector that is artificial propped up..
despite weak demand .
like the " housing " bubble at the beginning of the __name1__ administration .
there is strong demand for __name1__ education .
and that 's world wide .
low cost loans , credit not a problem .
try thinking beyond that .
add state government increasing funding to buy votes .
__quant1__ result is higher tuition .
but those teachers deserve all that money and perks on the tax payer dime right ?
there is !
there is !!!
it 's called __name1__ .
here 's dougie downer to shoot to pieces another thread .
why the heck are you so unhappy .
you 've got a real cute " rent @-@ a @-@ wife " and live in the __name1__ .
yep .
people are just standing in lines waitin ' to become teachers .
hoo boy .
and cab drivers too !
although i think cab drivers pay slightly better .
actually , as an owner of a temporary placement agency ( we are a business planning and human resources solutions firm in the __name1__ area ) , it does not actually work that way .
we can not offer a temp a lower salary and then deny him @/@ her unemployment if he @/@ she rejects the assignment .
it willbe a valid rebuttle and we would lose .
furthermore , we would never want to alienate a good tempoorary employee with such an act .
maybe some of the smaller shops that try to maximize revenue at the cost of quality service do ...
but as someone in the industry for over __quant1__ decades , __value1__ % of that time as an owner , that is only successful for the short term .
for your inventory ( temps ) is at a constant and constantly rotating in and out .
you need to grow inventory to grow revenue .
what many people dont realize is we value our temps as much as we value our clients .
we must perform superior customer service for all of them .
i never had any luck with the temp agencies , __quant1__ time i got a voice mail from one of them saying they had a job for me .
i called back , and the lady said sorry since you did n't answer we offered the job to the next person on the list who answered the phone , that did n't make any damn sense to me .
part of our business is very time sensitive .
we may get a call from a client saying that they need something and called another service as well..
and the one who performs the quickest gets the order .
we explain that to our tempos when they apply with us so they understand the importance of always being reachable..
to the best oif their ability .
we have some temps that make great money with us .
great relationships .
we give them bonuses this time __quant1__ year .
last few __quant1__ they werent overly impressive ...
but the appreciation was there ...
and returned with great quality and a great representation of our firm .
i suggest you spread yourself out .
it is a matter of establishing yourself with one who sees your differential ...
whatever it may be .
present yourself as confident , reliable , and willing to do whatever you can to represent them at the highest of levels .....
dont make it like " i need to make money ...
or ....
im desperate ...
im doing this only so unemployemtn sees i am looking for a job .
instead , make it like you are an asset to them .....
not that they are an asset to you .
you will find you are treated with great respect with that typoe of approach .
lol .
if i help you find a job , it will be my pleasure to buy you a beer .
just say , the topic is beyond your understanding and its all good .
great move having government take over loans and reduce the payment .
you will be paying longer and more interest .
then you are the only one , or the laws in __name1__ are different .
i dont know if the laws are different .
but the unemployment rep has the authority to apporve or denyt unemployment .
it is not black and white .
conditions , circumstances , outside forces are considered ...
and there is always sympathy for the one making the claim .
the only people we deny unemployment to are ones that refuse to take an assignemnt at their rate three times in a row .
and we document every event .
beyond my understanding ?
my mom just retired .
she was a teacher .
she started out with shit pay..
long hours and lots of long nights .
she had to get her masters .
that and i 've had a few friends that were college professors .
__quant1__ guy did it during his time searching for another radio producer gig .
he taught __quant1__ class and was done .
shit pay..
so yeah..
i have first hand experience with it .
they have in place in most companies cutters and slashers .
this only works for a few years .
they cut and slash their way in a bloated system to profits .
at some point there is no more fat to cut .
the corps will settle for profit any way its made .
when slash and burn is done you have to make profits some way .
at the point that they need to hire to make more profits they will hire .
no __name1__ tricks like trashing the debt ceiling or refusing tax cuts to the middle ( even while they claim they are all about tax cuts ) will stop the corps from finding profits .
unfortunately for the right we have about hit the point where to make more profits the corps are going to have to hire .
while the republicans will do anything for corporations you see the corporations are not as devoted to the __name1__ .
they will not hold back jsut to help you get elected if there are profits to be made .
you serve a disloyal mistress cons .
who would have thought that tm was a captain of industry ! ?
" we have about hit the point where to make more profits the corps are going to have to hire ."
we have , " hit the point ? "
what " point " would that be ?
i thought the only way to save an economy was to raise taxes .
and allow government to " create " jobs using a massive stimulous package ?
i 'm all good now i got a full time job with the feds .
no , you had __value1__ hand experience .
you never actually were a teacher : this would have given you __value1__ hand experience .
eventually we 'll all be good with " a full time job with the feds ."
mr. obama ?
is that you ?
if it is , you 're going to be losing that job in about __quant1__ year .
so you may want to consider my advice .
my tongue was planted firmly in my cheek , referring to the new fee in the payroll extension that dings folks getting or renewing mortgages .
insignificant
my understanding of a " bubble " is a sector that is artificially propped up..
um ...
what ?
using your definition - there was no housing bubble .
a bubble is a market that is artificially propped up for any reason .
including creating an artificial demand .
education demand is false .
it is not reality .
we have eons of kids who could n't graduate high school getting __quant1__ year loans including room and board .
no college in their right mind would accept these kids in the past , and not one bank would give them a loan prior to the government guaranteeing the loan .
colleges are filled with kids who do n't belong there .
and the only reason they are there is because of insane student loan practices that are identical in everyway to the insane mortgage loan practices .
to you maybe .
__quant1__ bucks __quant2__ week is n't ?
especially when you give __quant2__ week __quant2__ month back if you ever get or renew another mortgage .
yer gonna make every liberal 's head explode with that kinda reality .
i did teach a tae kwon do class..
and a gymnastics class once..
does that count ?
okay..
i stand corrected .
so you helped little boys do back hand spings , back flips with full twists and ...
dare i say .....
back bends ?
mr. sandusky ?
is that you ?
since i was a public school teacher , i 'll let you pass .
how do you figure that ?
how did i know that was coming ?
again ...
i am not just talking about domestic demand .
and i am surprised by the " kids who do n't belong there " crapola .
every __name1__ kid belongs in college .
in any case..
__name1__ cut taxes..
and lowered interest rates to __value1__ .
that..
and the deregulation brought about by the loss of __name1__ @-@ __name1__ created a plethora of predatory loan companies .
that 's a real bubble .
do you know something that i dont know about the power of the president ? ??
the only way i see any president influencing the economy in a good way is by representing populist opinion that is based in sound economic theory .
aside from the power to veto and the command of the military the president is not intended to have all that much actual power .
he is totally dependent on the __name1__ .
i just want to see your thoughts behind your statement , if you have any .
i am also interested to know what candidate you think would best fill the role that you have in mind .
__name2__ is the only one i see with any real plan that is within his power and is totally doable even with the ' do nothing ' __name1__ .
returning all the troops home from any country that requests it would be one hell of a start .
thats 200 @-@ 300 thousand people with good middle class jobs moving into every neighborhood in the country .
the border will be secured , which will cause the value of labor to rise .
plundering of the treasury and destruction of the dollar will be halted through the power of the veto .
a competing currency will be introduced , although that must go through __name1__ so there is little hope presently .
inflation will continue for __quant1__ however as the market finds equilibrium from the __value1__ % erosion of dollar values .
most important is the reductions in spending .
consider the __quant1__ in cuts a start .
__quant1__ is kinda a magic number , its just enough to start seriously addressing the debt .
overnight confidence the dollar will begin surge .
so this is going to effect the market hard and fast in __quant1__ very good ways .
purchasing power of the general public is going to rise , regulations that prevent competition and expansion of economy will be reduced , and lower taxes .
if we bring all the troops home with no bases overseas , i see a big cut in military personnel so there won't be that many people spending money here like you say , if we do n't maintain a presence overseas we won't need a military of this size .
" every kid belongs in college " - that is a huuuge pile of dog poo .
a kid who can n't ( for whatever reason ) hack high school in no way will be successful in higher education .
that is really dumb thinking sallow .
and another thing ....
the housing bubble started in the __name1__ admin ?
c'mon...
i would expect better from you than that .
that is t @-@ m and rdean speak .
started ?
no..
not completely .
but it went into overdrive with __name1__ .
when __name1__ talked about letting some mortgages lapse to clear the market..
that should have occurred at the beginning of __year1__ .
and kids not " hacking " high school..
do so for any number of reasons..
that need to be addressed .
unless there is some physical deficiency..
no one is born stupid .
sigh ....
it is this kind of thinking that is destroying education .
liberals not wanting to admit that not everyone is cut out for higher education .
liberals modifying testing results because they do n't like the image it presents .
liberals giving wholesale passes to minorities who are failing their class but refuse to give them failing grades , and do everything in their power to skew the grading curve so that you would practically have to rape a fellow student , in class - to fail .
booooosh ! !
for christssakes .
__name1__ and the __name3__ __name2__ were on vacation for __quant1__ years ? ??
i wish you partisan shites would fucking pay attention .
maybe if i made it simple :
since __year1__ , the __name1__ only controlled both the presidency and the __name2__ and the __name3__ for __quant1__ ( __quant1__ ) years ; during the 108 th and 109 th __name5__ .
housing and construction are the backbones of this economy .
they are both showing improvement and the confidence level is improving .
i think many economist may be surprised at the amount of growth we will see by year 's end ( __year1__ ) ....
or the world could come to an end .
from what i 've seen or read , most economists do not expect gdp to be much higher than __value1__ % , some think closer to __value2__ % or even lower .
that ain't going to translate into a hiring boom .
wish it would happen , a lotta people need a job , but i 'm not seeing it .
the interesting thing is , there are many job openings .
so why can n't they be filled ?
you show me a bunch of women that worked in a bank in __name1__ , __name2__ , and ask them to drive __quant1__ wheelers in __name3__ during __month1__ , then __month1__ 'll show you a bunch of unemployed people .
some of the jobs are low paying manual labor that many people do n't want to do , especially if they 're getting a ue check .
some jobs require a specific skill that most people do n't have , and again , those that do are collecting that ue check .
no doubt there are other reasons as well .
and they did n't have a filibusterproof __name1__ either .
i 'm sure you 're right .
however , most ue pays for job training .
so , if you do n't have the skill ( driving an __quant1__ wheeler ) , you can be trained .
you are correct : it 's easier to sit in a park in __name1__ and bitch @-@ and @-@ moan than to learn a skill that is marketable .
btw if anyone is interested in doing more than " protesting , " __name1__ will pay for your $ __quant1__ , __quant2__ week , truck driving class .
of course you gotta have a clean ua , and a good driving record .
starting pay is about $ 40k/yr
experience maxes out at about $ 80k/yr .
soon there will be no way to hide the bad economy .
no amount of fuzzy numbers will cover it up .
some experts predict things will get worse at the beginning of __year1__ .
people get lazy when they think the government can come and save them .
thing is who 's going to save the government with the bottom falls out .
why ?
lets get back to the hiring boom .
please detail what you would consider a hiring boom , i am curious .
his over @-@ reliance on diplomacy with __name1__ has been costly for critical progress .
that being said , i do think he is a good president let me explain why i did n't choose the other options :
1 ) i think __name1__ shares the blame a little on the slow recovery of the economy , but i think there are many factors to be considered ( i.e . , __name2__ )
2 ) i think his foreign policy has been great
3 ) despite __name1__ , his energy policy has been quite successful
4 ) it was bush that supercharged the defict ( although some of the blame does go to __name1__ , too )
5 ) his taxation policy would have been great had it not been for what i chose out of this poll
6 ) national security has undoubtedly been his best work ( even __name1__ can admit that ) .
please explain your choice .
his foreign policy has been abysmal .
today , thanks to __name2__ , we 're leaving __name1__ in shame .
the troops are just glad to be leaving , but everyone knows __name1__ intentionally screwed the pooch there .
nobody likes us .
at one time everyone thought that __name1__ was hated , but __name2__ has taken hatred of __name3__ to a new level .
it 's time we got this childish __name1__ out of the __name2__ and put somebody responsible back at the helm .
you have absolutely no perspective whatsoever .
for one thing , polls show most __name1__ ( including most __name2__ ) agree that ending the war in __name3__ was a good idea .
no he hasnt .
he has never publically supported the __name1__ .
he 's been a weak leader who has divided this country .
he is like a liberal __name1__ .
who are you to talk ?
can you come up with an objective approach ?
no , because you are too biased .
meaning i should n't talk ?
sorry , but you do n't skate on this one .
and i certainly do n't answer to you .
any promise or objective can be set up correctly with measures .
as to weight , that depends on your point of view .
but , __name1__ holds no sway if people do n't agree to the measures to begin with .
and this is n't about dissing __name1__ .
they are simply reporting .
but they report raw numbers and to allow you to hold those up as being meaningful would be a mistake on our part .
do you want to support your statement that i am too biased .
or is this just a smokescreen because someone is calling you on your supposed " logical " approach .
you calling it useless without giving good reason why or coming up with an alternate source of analysis on his promises , makes you biased .
the raw data speaks for itself .
__name1__ has succeeded on most of his campaign promises .
i do n't need an alternative to show you methodology to be flawed .
and for someone who has critical thinker in his @/@ her avatar , it is obvious you do n't know what that means .
and attempting to use it to prove bias is almost laughable .
well , actually it is laughable .
there may not be a way to actually meaningfully measure his promises kept .
raw data , espcially in this case , would need to be processed .
just looking at the numbers is meaningless .
creating __quant1__ jobs huh ?
want to cite that .
and investing in green tech .
he has not invested __quant1__ dime in green tech .
what he has invested in is companies .
companies that are going to go with the status quo as long as they can sell it and are going to resist all efforts to push green tech any further than immediate profits .
this is the problem that i have with government ' investment ' in technology .
that investment should begin and end with straight out research grants that are awarded to people that are purely in it to push the technology .
companies do not need incentive for r&d .
they will do so as long as they can make a profit .
in that regard , no matter how much you give them , it will not change their r&d goals .
on the other hand , the government must invest in technology because it is the only entity that can invest billions pushing a tech to the next level and shrug the losses off .
this is even more true in cases where no benefits are actually realized .
see __name1__ for situations where government investment in technology has pushed the envelope .
investing in companies in the tech industry is not the place of government and does not end well .
establishing an energy policy with __name1__ does some good .
stopping __name1__ drilling does far more bad .
__name1__ href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/promise/439/create-5-million-green-jobs/"> politifact | the __value1__ 5 __value1__ " __value1__ " jobs </a>
__value1__ . you dodged all but the __value1__ sentence of my post .
2 . your link does not substantiate your claim .
until the __name1__ completes these surveys , the exact number of newly created green jobs is open to debate .
__name1__ -- which advises the president on economic matters --claims that __quant1__ green jobs have been saved or created through the __value1__ __quant2__ months of __year1__ .
claims .
yes , that 's convincing verbiage .
as of yet , there is simply not enough data to accurately gauge the progress in green job growth .
because of this , we continue to rate this promise as in the works .
225k is nowhere near a million .
even more so because it is essentially a guess .
we also need to include the fact that the goal posts were moved from creating those jobs to now created or saved .
heap that on top of the fact that the numbers of created or saved jobs has essentially been a farce through the economic downturn and you have nothing on that claim whatsoever .
true , i was quoting __name1__ .
however , i bet his estimate will come close .
we will have to wait and see .
we are running out of the fuels we have .
we need to invest in alternate forms of energy .
is gov involvement the best way to go ?
no , but it 's a start .
energy companies arent going to do it .
i never said it was perfect .
i just challenged you to come up with something better .
for now , it is best source we have .
i picked the economy .
i picked it because instead of using his political capital at the beginning of his presidency to adress jobs , unemployment , the budget defecit , and the national debt he used up all that capital getting __name1__ passed .
the double whammy is __name1__ has actually , unlike it was intended to according to those who supported it , hurt the economy and the national debt along with cutting __name2__ .
if __name1__ had been even more antipathetic to __name2__ than he already was , the backlash from the people would have been even stronger than the profound levels it reached in __year1__ .
__name1__ 's version of bipartisanship is like an abusive parent offering their child candy while slapping them in the face .
it was a recipe for schizophrenic government , which is what we have now .
__name1__ is a failed leader .
the bias of your poll , billy , was obvious .
when i saw your longest entry , i guessed what your choice was without you explaining it .
anyone claiming __name1__ has n't been partisan toward conservatives and __name2__ is either blind or a far left liberal .
i also picked the economy , for more or less those reasons .
if __name1__ had paid more attention to how the stimulus was used and to making __name2__ work as he said it would , then the recovery could have been much more robust .
what would have happened if __name1__ had taken his supposed zeal for infrastructure and actually put some effort into backing that in __year1__ ?
instead he neutralized most of the positive effect the stimulus and his other programs could have had by spending all that time on __name1__ .
it has been a raincloud over the economy .
it 's not a failure so much as a deception .
__name1__ campaigned in __year1__ as a progressive , and the people who voted him into office believed that 's what he was .
i remember being thrilled at how many small donations he was receiving , and thinking naively that maybe this was a way around corporate dominance of the government .
boy , was i wrong .
down the list , almost every " failure " of the __name1__ administration can be seen instead to be deliberate policy .
for example , __name2__ is believed by some to have shown weak leadership on health @-@ care reform , letting __name1__ craft the bill for him .
but when it looked like no reform was going to pass , he demonstrated that he had the ability to twist arms and guide the process to what he wanted .
so what does that mean ?
it means that he let it go as long as it was going the way he wanted , and took an active role when it looked like it was n't .
he was n't " weak " on this : he was corrupt .
he got a health @-@ care reform bill that his campaign contributors , who included health @-@ insurance companies in large amounts , could be happy with .
__name1__ is the reason we do n't have a public option .
if he 'd intended there to be one , we would have one .
look at who he appointed to key economic positions in his cabinet : __name1__ cronies and tools , architects of center @-@ right corporate @-@ friendly economic policy , __name3__ @-@ era __name2__ retreads .
the __name1__ did not pressure him into appointing geithner as __name2__ secretary , nor did he need their approval to do so .
he did that on his own initiative .
__name1__ is simply not the progressive friend of the people that he claimed to be in __year1__ .
and that is his biggest failing .
bingo .
as i said .
running for potus is a whole hell of a lot easier that being potus.especially when you do n't have the skills for it .
these same people did n't seem to have a problem when there was a campaign going on to pull ads from the glen __name1__ show .
go to __name1__ and shop folks .
it 's still a free country and i do n't care what their reason are for pulling their ads .
it 's no ones business .
wow ...
i do n't remember a " campaign " of any sort ...
i think __name1__ dug his own grave with his false version of __name2__ and his outlandish nature .
there was a concentrated effort on the part of the left , led by __name2__ , to get advertisers to pull their ads from __name1__ 's show .
which i personally have no problem with .
__name1__ is a horrible human being .
__name1__ lowe 's pulls __name3__ __name1__ tlc __value1__ ' __value1__ american muslim __name4__ - cnn.com </a>
__name1__ pulled an ad they had placed on __name2__ @-@ __name2__ essentially claiming that the show was to controversial .
now they are getting a lot of flack claiming that they are upholding an anti __name1__ bigoted attitude .
as i understand it , the show is based around american __name1__ and the struggles they are facing in a post __name3__ @/@ __name3__ __name2__ .
while i have no issues with how lowes decides to advertise , this does seem like a bone headed move particularly considering that i would have never even known about the show in the __value1__ place until __name1__ created this controversy .
many people are now calling __name1__ bigoted for this move .
your thoughts ?
they are free to do this .
and they should n't complain or ask for federal aid when they experience a backlash .
elaborate , please .
huh..
you 've turned into a regular little __name1__
i completely agree with both points .
however , i personally would not have pulled the ad 's unless the ratings were lower than i wanted them to be for a time slot my commercial would air .
why ? ?
i would have pulled the ads just because the show was horse shit and a mockery of our freedom , hence no one wanted to watch it..
quite frankly i would have never advertised with the program to begin with ...
the whole concept was an oxymoron from the start..
not that they will , but why should federal aid be linked to whether a company is " politically correct " or not .
there 's only one good reason why a company should get a bailout , and that 's if the consequences of its sudden collapse would be more economically disasterous than just letting the market take its course , and if it has a reasonable change of viability after the bailout in order to pay the money back .
federal backlash ? ??
what the fuck does that mean stalin ? ?
do you expect __name1__ to sue __name2__ ? ??
hahahaha
you 're one dumb motherfucker ...
thanks for showing how authoritarian progressives are ...
the show is just propiganda .
they want to show us how __name1__ are misunderstood victims .
next time i need to shop for some tools , fuck __name2__ , i 'm going to __name1__ .
imo , __name1__ is way better anyways , i appreciate their position but they have what i need all the time unlike __name2__ ...
sometimes they both suck ...
lol .
i needed a spotlight fixture for my __name1__ lights ( just the holder on a spike ) .
__name1__ was out .
__name1__ was out .
__name1__ was out .
__name1__ was out .
__name1__ @-@ __name1__ was out .
the little mom & pop __name1__ __quant1__ block from my house that __quant1__ never shop at had about a hundred in stock .
sure , they were $ __quant1__ more than the others would have been ...
but they had them .
i 'm certain the entire hypocritical land of left wing lunatics will label lowe 's bigoted and are even threatening a boycott .
this is a free country .
lowe 's should be able to spend their advertising dollars when and where they want to without being accused of bigotry .
i 'll continue to make it my store of choice when i need home improvement .
c'mon , how many of the progressives that are outraged over this do you think can even swing a hammer ?
or have the ambition too ?
good point .
very comical to watch .
interesting to see how many conservatives think __name1__ only carries hammers ...
( btw , this progressive helped build the house i live in and the house my parents live in ...
but do n't let that keep you from making idiotic comments like the one above for willow to froth over
however , __quant1__ have already heard __quant1__ radio ditto head ( __name1__ ) call for a boycot so they are already on that train ....
hey , i 've met the odd progressive who does n't swing a hammer like the __name1__ throws a baseball , just not too many .
there 's an " all american muslim " show ?
i did n't know that .
i 'm __name1__ - how about an " all american kraut " series for us ?
did n't you watch " __name1__ " as a kid ?
with almost __quant1__ years in the business , there is much truth to his statement .
every stereotype has exceptions .
they have a right to spend their money where they set fit .
they do .
if they pulled it because they did n't like the subject matter of the show , that 's kind of wrong .
i mean , this is the network that gave us the __name1__ and the shows about the midgets , which is a lot more obnoxious than a show about __name2__ .
if they pulled the ads because no one was watching the show , then it 's a sensible business decision .
as far as i can tell , ratings had nothing to do with it .
it was centered solely on the fact that the subject matter was __name1__ and they were getting a lot of feedback with strong opinions on the subject matter .
go figure .
as i said , it was a dumb move on their part as no one would have ever found out about the ads other than those that watch the show .
they obviously do not care about the controversy .
now many people are pissed .
not sure if i care at all myself but i did want to see some opinions @/@ discussions of the people here .
many are calling it a racist move but i do n't think that a company of that scope makes decisions on this scale with a racist intent .
they have far too much money on the line .
it seems they did not think it through though .
what part of this are you having trouble understanding ?
" lowe 's has received a significant amount of communication on this program , from every perspective possible .
individuals and groups have strong political and societal views on this topic , and this program became a lightning rod for many of those views .
as a result we did pull our advertising on this program , " the company said in a statement saturday .
none .
where have i stated anything that would lead you to believe i do not understand their statement ?
i do n't have a lowe 's near me but __name1__ does suck .
i went in to buy some half inch by __quant1__ lag bolts and they had none , i mean none at all .
those lags are one of the staples of construction and are required by code and there were none .
__quant2__ went in yesterday and they were out of __quant1__ amp circuit breakers .
i am hoping a lowe 's will be built nearby .
it appears __name1__ also pulled their ads , but they cited the poor quality of the show .
great point .
especially since being a __name1__ is a nationality just like being __name2__ .
lmao ! !
and i thought i had run into stupidity before .
__name1__ is so the elderly , poor and infirm won't have to go to a county poor farm to die and end up in an unmarked grave .
how do you feel about the __quant1__ in this country who have no health insurance .
i have a suggestion for you .....
next time some __name1__ bastard starts an unnecessary war how bout you go and help fight the goddam thing .
yes ....
__name1__ is for the elderly and helps the poor and infirm ....
so how does __name1__ 's plan to stop paying for __name2__ ( i.e . unfunding it by getting rid of the payroll tax ) help the elderly , the poor and the infirm ..... ?
fyi we are flat broke ....
do n't forget __name1__ cut __name2__ too ......
the first president to ever do so is president obama ( d ) and he did so with __name1__ .....
makes me laugh at the meme " __name1__ hate the elderly ".
no.
__name1__ did not cut __name2__ .
the cuts do n’t come from the current __name1__ budget , they put a leash on future growth and payment increases .
__name4__ href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/12/mitt-romney/romney-says-only-obama-has-cut-medicare/"> __name1__ __value1__ __name2__ __value1__ __name3__ cut medicare </a>
the same way __name1__ payed for his tax cuts for the wealthy .
__name1__ always seems to be intent on " paying for a tax cut ".....
we 're not hearing much about it .....
but it appears that __quant1__ way to " pay for " the payroll tax cut will be to increase the cost of mortgages ....
more sneaky fees ....
<a href="http://www.koco.com/r/29979321/detail.html"> payroll tax cut : how to pay for it ? </a>
<a __name1__ oklahoma city news __name2__ - koco oklahoma city </a>
first , i think that the payroll tax cut is a bad idea .
i understand the desire to get more money into the hands of people that will circulate it in the economy .
however , a tax cut that means less money in the __name1__ funds is hardly a wise move .
in fact , what we need to do , is immediatly restore the tax structure we had under __name1__ .
then add another __value1__ % for those making over __quant2__ __quant1__ __quant2__ year .
cap the __name1__ taxes at $ __quant1__ , and make is on all income .
then start to rebuild our grid , to make it both a truly national grid , and to make it less vulneable to natural and manmade disasters .
pay for it the same way we have paid for the __name1__ .
water systems in this nation are not only in major jeopardy for many our our metropolitan areas , but many of the existings systems lose nearly as much water as they deliver .
water is __quant1__ of the key __quant2__ things needed for survival , we are already seeing the some cities reusing sewage water .
time to go to work on that , also .
kill the __name1__ @-@ __name1__ weopons systems , only spend as much on defense as the next __quant1__ nations combined , and the infrastructure improvement become doable .
we 've had the payroll tax " holiday " for __quant1__ year now and it has not helped the economy in any significant way ....
another leftie failure to fix ....
when is the left going to agree to a pro @-@ growth tax structure to bring jobs back..?
taxing the rich is n't going to cut it ...
agree with you about the water systems and our grids .....
disasters in the making ....
and this is going to help pay for the upcoming boomers __name1__ how .... ?
bo just stole from peter to pay paul .....
paul is __name1__ ....
actually __name1__ , pushed by the __name2__ and __name3__ himself , cuts half a trillion from __name4__ over the next __quant1__ years ( the study will say __quant2__ years but __quant3__ year has passed already
) <a href="http://www.cms.gov/actuarialstudies/downloads/2010tralternativescenario.pdf"> http://www.cms.gov/actuarialstudies/...vescenario.pdf </a>
agreed .
in fact , __quant1__ of my disappointments is that he has not been liberal enough !
specifically , a larger stimulus was needed and a public option should not have been taken off the table .
he had no choice and he did n't give a fuck .
what makes me laugh is that you guys ( and by ' you guys ' i mean all those who have n't worked the truth out yet ) ....
is that you keep falling for the bullshit .
heh heh cute .
but please , run along .
the adults are trying to have a conversation .
really ?
where ?
cuz all i can see is a bunch of whiny assed children .
christ some of you members have __quant1__ sense of humor .
lighten up
i have a sense of humor .
i laugh at your stupidity quite often .
and somehow i am not offended
good .
the truth should never offend .
my shovel was ready !
there 's a job going in __name1__ for those who shovels .
there 's a lot of bullshit that needs removing .
you do n't go after banks corporations too much in a bad recession .
i have n't seen any plausible ways suggested to get them to stop hoarding .
any public option would have lost us __name1__ and the whole __name2__ .
could n't get anymore .
i believe he could have seized the major banks and nationalized them .
then forced them to lend the money given them by __name1__ , and also force them to rewrite loans .
that certainly would have helped get the country going again and was being called for by some of the more far left liberals .
i did n't mean to suggest a public option would have made it all the way through , but __name1__ dropped it quicker than he dropped smoking .
that never made sense to me .
and to what extent ?
i think __name1__ has undeniably accomplished a lot in his __value1__ __quant1__ years , but his over @-@ reliance on diplomacy with __name2__ has impeded critical progress .
i 'm sure the cons @/@ repubs on here are undoubtedly going to answer this question too , but at least try and be mature about it ...
*plays flute to summon the small band of lefties out of the woodwork*
" diplomacy with the __name1__ "?
you gotta be fucking on something..
my biggest disappointment with __name2__ is that , in negotiations , he tends to give too much to the __name1__ in hopes that they 'll be fair and willing partners in governance .
i realize that he 's trying to appeal to the middle , but at some point he 's got to say enough is enough ( which he seems to be doing now - we 'll see ) .
if he did n't already know it , he should know by now that the __name1__ is not the least bit interested in compromise .
i agree .
you got it .
that 's the only issue i had .
his willingness to compromise did n't fly because of their ' make him a __quant1__ term president ' agenda .
he then should have came out guns blazing .
you are on something , another planet .
how many __name1__ should he have killed doyathink ?
three .
__name1__ .
__name1__ .
__name1__ .
any other moronic questions ?
are you as disappointed as i am with the violent rhetoric from the left ?
you mean like __name1__ ?
give some examples of this .
it just shows how looney left you are .
__name1__ is the most divisive bitterly partisan president in my lifetime , and that 's up against some pretty stiff competition .
really ?
how old are you ?
i 'd have to say __name1__ was the most divisive one i 've ever lived through .
do you have some examples of how bitterly divisive __name1__ has been ?
actually , the fact that you think __name1__ , who is quite conservative in his governance as __name2__ go , is some kind of extreme left @-@ wing ideologue , shows how looney right you are .
nice diversion .
try answering the question .
i agree .
either kaz thinks __name1__ is a centrist , or kaz is a child .
i wonder which it is .
i 'm a __name1__ .
he is a liar .
by backing down on the public option .
you talk like he could have passed a public option bill .
he did n't have the votes from his own party for that .
he had to bribe to get the bill passed that he has .
__name1__ should have invoked the 14 th __name2__ during the made @-@ up debt crisis created by the teapubs .
he should have kept the public option on the table too .
the dems need to stop compromising when it 's clear the other side has no intention of doing so .
he 'd better not compromise and give in to the pipeline if the repubs attach it to the payroll tax cuts .
i 've been pretty pleased with __name1__ on the whole but if he caves on that one too , damn i 'm gonna be pissed .
yeah !
it would be a fucking shame to put __quant1__ __name1__ to work and to find a source that is n't arab..
we got it .
we fucking got it .
asswipe .
in this case , you mean __name1__ 's got it .
yeah , it would be a shame to spend all that time and money investing in a filthy , polluting energy source instead of spending time and money on cleaner , cheaper alternatives .
funny how the __name1__ repubs are fired up all of sudden about jobs when they have n't given a shit about jobs since they took the majority .
nice fairy tale , yours ?
i absolutely agree with you on the 14 th __name1__ .
of course , the tpers claim __name1__ took total control of all medical care in the country , so i 'm sure it does n't take much imagination to know what they would claim if he had gone the 14 th __name2__ route .
still , would have been nice to see .
i see him compromising on the pipeline just like he did with the tax cuts for the wealthy .
the __name1__ has proven they will destroy families in order to get what they want .
__name1__ really has no choice .
they sure have .
__name1__ declared the bill doa anyway so hopefully he won't give __name2__ a chance to cave .
if the payroll tax goes back up __value1__ % to it 's original amount , it would suck but it would n't be the end of the world to me .
let the __name1__ obstructionists play their game .
if it 's going to hit them in their wallets , they 'll eventually scramble and draw up a clean bill .
so you support the continued fleecing and bankrupting of __name1__ .
the cut has been ineffective . , but as long as you get some welfare its good right ?
ineffective ?
first off , i thought conservatives believed any and all tax cuts are good .
they always create jobs , always .
second , we 've had private sector job growth every month since the cut was in place .
what world do you live in ?
there 's a switch , huh ?
a conservative in favor of letting taxes increase ....
to fund ss no less .
you thought ?
damn , i missed it .
my bad .
what you already said ...
is the biggest reason for me .
he and his admin .
have also shown they 're not much better than the repubs when it comes to the big banks .
yes , and what i find so bizarre about it is that repubs are constantly trying to paint him as this liberal extremist .
i mean that charge is just so patently false .
__quant1__ of the stimulus was given to banks overseas !!!
yeah lets give em __quant1__ more !!
libbs are idiots !!
heh heh you think the stimulus was __quant1__ ?
i think you have some reading to do .
i think he 's got a few years of grammar school to make up __value1__ .
what makes you think that a __name1__ president has the right to seize banks and nationalize them ?
the reason that the __name1__ has always attracted foreign investment is that we are a nation of laws in which the owners of private companies are protected from arbitrary " seizures " of their assets by the government .
do you not grasp that this is what makes us different than so many other places in the world ?
as for " forcing " banks to make loans ?
have you so quickly forgotten that doing that was what got us into trouble with the housing bubble that just burst ?
it used to be that banks looked for __value1__ % down on a house and one had to prove credit worthiness .
that all changed when government intervened in the process and forced banks to make loans to people that did n't qualify under previous standards .
" forcing " banks into making bad loans was bad policy before and it remains so now .
that 's the really frightening part !
that they think that way .
they are nothing but a bunch of __name2__ trying to " fundamentally change __name1__ "
my biggest disappointment is that he seems to think he is above politics .
he thinks he can stay out of the infighting and come in at the last minute and resolve everything .
he has an idealistic view that if he is reasonable , the other side will be reasonable too .
the result is that he is the only person in the room compromising
the result was an unfocused stimulus bill trying to please everyone .
he gave up the government option on healthcare .
he extended the __name1__ tax cuts and offered spending cuts without corresponding revenue increases
on the bright side , it seems he has learned his lesson and realizes the other side is not playing by the same rules
yet another liberal circle jerk
yeah , that 's how we got __name1__ rammed down our throats .
that 's not what 's rammed down your throat though , is it rw ?
labeling it this way or that is n't going to hinder their attempts at preventing it next time .
and how would you prevent , apart from banning people from the service based on religion which is ludacrous in regard to the spirit of our country ......
and being a good human being in general .
that is n't at all true .
__name1__ was well known to be a nutcase .
he was n't hiding it .
people noticed that he was saying more and more radical things .
because he was __name1__ , everyone was too afraid to say anything for fear they would be identified as being somehow anti muslim .
we should never be afraid to be intimidated by religion to say that a __name1__ is a dangerous lunatic .
ok several things going on in thios post :
-@ if personal individuals ignored lunatic talk for fear they 'd somehow be labeled anti @-@ __name1__ , they 're either irrational or they 're cowards .
they lack character and should be seen as such , as look what their cowardice has allowed to slip through the cracks .
personal responsibility ?
helloo000 oo0o ?
-#2 : whether his crazy talk was " terrorist , " " torture and kill @-@ ist , " " cannibalist , " - does n't matter - his intent was " to kill , " killing is killing is killing , get over your fraudulant labels that serve nothing but a political end with a bloody means .
get real .
and lastly - all adults should know the difference between pointing out real lunacy , and being a bigot against a certain religion or culture .
if you can n't tell the difference ?
> go back to school .
it 's not " pc crap " that 's at fault , it 's your supreme lack of common sense and analytical thinking skills that are at fault .
and simply because idiots lack that common sense and analytical thinking prowess , does n't mean it should all of a sudden be a @-@ ok to be a bigot .
low road taking assed fool .
do you oppose the labeling of this war called ' the war on terrorism '?
anyone care to explain what would be gained by politicizing this tragedy ?
well , i didnt know thats what i was doing .
im done here .....
this is going nowhere .
you guys have fun though .
usually , when people say " pc crap , " what they 're referring to is " having respect for people ."
it says something when you rail tooth and nail against that .
it 's not being " politically correct " to ignore a __name1__ guy talking crazy terror talk - - - - - - it 's being retarded .
the difference between calling it the " war on terror " and the " war on organized crime/murder " is n'il to me .
means absolutely dick .
if it makes you sleep better , i 'm all for it .
seriously , i 'm genuinely astonished that anyone can agree with the official , carpet sweeping description of what happened at ft . __name1__ .
it was a terrorist attack co @-@ ordinated by an __name1__ fundamentalist .
and how is the targeting of personel with a firearm an accident , regardless of whether or not it happened at a workplace ( in this case being a military installation )?
__quant1__ year from now , we wont have to worry about this __name1__ show anymore ...........
indeed .
perhaps the __name1__ act heading the show will choke on a bullet and we 'll have to chalk it up as one of those unfortunate , unavoidable accidents .
its just stupid @-@ ass shit like this that makes me salivate about the prospect of a __name1__ @/@ __name2__ debate ! !
this is old news , but still an insult to those who died !
it was a terrorist attack period !
seriously ?
you sure ?
death is n't death ?
it makes a difference to them which type of murder it was ?
it certainly matters to you .
why else do you pass hate crime legislation ?
hmmm ?
thanks so much for reinforcing what i wrote .
a non @-@ reply like this is sure @-@ fire proof that its true .
soggy never has an actual real thought , just chimes in to let others know how wrong they are without much else .
if there 's __quant1__ thing the repubs @/@ teabags hate is when their really dumb " give the rich more money so they 'll give us jobs " is proven wrong .
incorrect .
it has n't happened yet and it ain't never gonna happen .
they know this .
their " leaders " know this .
there is n't anyone who does not know this premise is just plain stupid .
and , posting a line of silly little smiley faces does n't change that .
its just a way of diverting attention away from the truth of my words .
it 's funny when you ask for actual examples that highlight the points they try to make .
you get one of __quant1__ things
1 ) insults · 2 ) change of topic · 3 ) flat out ignored
there are few cons on this site who are capable of having an adult discussion .
unfortunately i have n't seen any of them in this thread .
income can never be fair .
person a makes $ 10.00 __quant1__ hour and works an __quant2__ hour day .
person b makes $ __quant1__ __quant2__ hour for an __quant3__ hour day , then works __quant4__ additional hours at $ __quant5__ __quant6__ hour .
there is an automatic inequality in income .
it is already unfair to the person who only walks off with $ __quant1__ for __quant2__ day 's work .
the only true " fair tax " would be a flat tax that everyone had to pay ...
everyone !
you make $ __quant1__ __quant2__ year , you pay __value1__ % .
you make $ __quant1__ __quant2__ year , you pay __value1__ % .
that is fair .
end of story .
well , a flat tax may or may not be more " fair " based on the bias of the individual determining " fair " but is that what is best for our long @-@ term growth and prosperity ?
fair is subjective ...
no matter how you look at it ...
someone or some group wil always claim unfair because it goes against their personal comfort or feelings or whatever ...
what this country should be concerned with is equal treatment by government under law ...
not treating dollar x differently for person y than how dollar a is being treated for person b ...
a sales tax is equal ...
not bothered by personal situations ....
not influenced by this voting group in particular ...
it is blind , and it is equal in treatment for every person and for every dollar spent ...
a similar system should be in place for dollars earned ...
with __quant1__ exceptions , __quant2__ deductions , and __quant3__ loopholes
our system is equal as it taxes the dollars earned , not the person .
you are treated no differently than i am for the __value2__ th dollar we each earn .
just like we are n't treated differently for the __value1__ dollar we both earn .
the dollars are taxed not the person .
simple plans for simple minds
your stock in trade .
hey ...
1 ) you are a stupid head · 2 ) i dont want to talk about taxes · 3 ) i am going to put you on ignore
lol , speak of the devil .
are you that fucking ignorant ? ?
treating each dollar and each person equally ....
the word __value1__ ...
not the word __value1__ ...
for when you treat dollar x by person y differently than dollar a by person b , it is indeed unequal treatment ...
how would you feel if then benefits were given under law by government for a person at dollar 60k , then more at dollar 200k , and even more at dollar 2 mil ? ?
it would be ' equal treatment ' under your definition , because if you then earned 2 mil , you would have the exact same benefits ...
the reason you advocate the reverse is nothing more than ' __value1__ '....
it 's ok because it is not you and because you feel they can afford it more , giving you more benefit from government at the expense of someone else ...
sales tax is an equal treatment tax ....
progressive income tax is not ...
and that , whether you like it or not , is truth
for the same reason , sales tax is not equal treatment .
the ore you earn , the more you spend , the more sales tax youy pay copmpared to someone who earns less and thus spends less .
yes .
imho , the progressive tax scale is fair .
the problem is n't taxes , it spending .
we need to force __name1__ to balance the budget .
so you think people should be treated differently based on the money they make rather than being treated equal before the law ...
how is that at all consistant with the idea that all men are created equal ?
everyone is treated the same under a progressive system .
we both get taxed the same on our __value1__ th dollar earned , we get taxed the same amount of our __value2__ dollar earned and we get taxed the same on our __value3__ dollar earned .
seems equal to me .
actually , that 's not true .
the tax code is full of deliberate carve outs and byzantine rules which lead to unintended results .
we do not get taxed the same based on income .
even the rules of what constitutes income are complicated .
our current tax code is the product of some social engineering , some legitimate means to fund the government , and a whole bunch of corruption in the process .
that has to be the ultimate in demagoguery .
the idea that you can tax someone 's income without taxing him is about as idiotic as you can get .
it 's hard to believe libturds have the nerve to spew such idiocies into a public forum
true .
our system is not as simple and ideal as i may have made it sound .
there are plenty of loopholes , breaks and ways around the system that make it unfair .
we need to clean up those loopholes and correct the system so the richest in our country can n't continue to get richer and richer while the middle class get poorer and poorer .
here comes the concrete thinker .
i would be surprised that someone can n't grasp what i meant , but it 's you , so ........
lol .
it went completely over your head .
i 'll give this one more try ....
our system taxes dollars in that ...
it does n't care who earns the money , but if anyone earns x dollars , they are paying a certain percentage .
if you earn more one year , and less the next year , the amount you pay will change because the rate is attached to the dollars , not the person .
if the rate was attached to the person , you could earn a __quant1__ dollars this year , pay x percentage of taxes and next year lets say you lose your job , go broke and make nothing , you would still be paying the same amount because the rate is attached to you , not the dollars .
that 's not how our system is , thankfully .
all you 're saying is that an income tax is not a capitation tax .
no duh ?
thanks for providing no useful information to the discussion .
you still have n't explained why it 's just for one person to pay a higher rate on his income than another .
i could conceive of a tax that was graduated according to the amount of melanin in your skin .
you might claim it discriminates against black people , but using your logic i would just say that it does n't tax black people , but the melanin in your skin .
of course taxes come out of someones pocket , that 's not at all what i was referring to .
whether you agree with this or not , i hope this makes sense now , but i 'm not holding my breath .
it only makes sense to people who have had a lobotomy .
i grasp exactly what you meant , that 's why i said it was idiotic .
there are no taxes that people do n't pay .
they all come out of someone 's pocket .
you said our system " taxes dollars , not people ."
what part did n't i understand ?
yet the left does n't talk about taxing the dollar .
they talk about taxing those evil , greedy , rich , __value1__ % bastards who are stealing wealth from the average __name1__ paying their " fair share ".
you know , the __value1__ % who pay __value2__ % of federal taxes while __value3__ % of the remaining __value4__ % pay nothing .
actually they do ...
the plans call for taxing incomes of over __quant1__ dollars , not specific people .
the legislation never says we want to tax , __name1__ or ruport __name2__ , etc , specifically .
i 'm glad you understand now .
i expected you to insult me once you finally understood what i mean , so thanks for that .
i tried to discuss with you before about why a flat tax would hurt the lowest earners but you ignored my question .
did you not understand that one either ?
i really can n't hold your hand through every post here .
at some point , you 're going to have to figure these things out on your own .
i agree on the clean up but i disagree on your reason .
the tax code ought to be used to properly fund government operations as determined by the voters in this country , not to regulate income .
you do n't like being insulted , but you never fail to use that condescending tone whenever you disagree with someone .
that 's why i seldom treat leftists with respect : they are all such colossal hypocrites .
we were discussing how it 's just for __quant1__ person to pay a higher rate on his income than another , not whether a flat tax hurts low wage earners .
however , __quant1__ consideration you continually ignore is that every flat tax proposal exempts income up to a certain point .
normally that point is well above the poverty line , so none of that actual flat tax proposals would hurt low wage earners .
that would still not be paying any additional tax .
tax shelters are a thing of the past .
tax deductions for children help everyone · write off of mortgage interest help the less wealthy afford homes ....
and are invariably offset by the real estate taxes they have to pay · tax deferred investments are income that are ultimately taxed .
i am curious what loopholes exist that you are referring to .
the major one i was referring to is capital gains and the fact that its taxed at a lower rate than income .
only at the personal level , not the corporate level .
capital gains plus corporate income tax is actually quite high .
that 's not true .
the rate is attached to the activity , not the dollar .
hence __name1__ paid __quant1__ in corporate taxes but i paid taxes in years where i lost money .
that 's the problem with using the tax code to execute social engineering .
it underfunds the government and does nothing to help those worst off .
but that is not a loophole ...
it is a separate tax altogether and is really a tax on " unearned " income in theory ..........
and it is available to anyone ...
whether they are incested in __quant1__ share of __name1__ or a __quant2__ shares of __name2__ .
it 's a loophole in that many of the wealthy derive their income in this manner , it 's why __name1__ is able to have a lower overall tax rate than his secretary .
__name1__ pays a lower rate than his secretary because he can afford to manipulate his income .
if you removed the " loophole " as you call it he would just use some other means to accomplish the same end .
also , it 's not necessarily bad that he pays a __value1__ % rate on his personal income .
if that rate doubled would he continue the same economic activity ?
would the government receive more funding as a result ?
the alternative minimum tax started out as a " millionaires tax ."
how has that worked out ?
your buddy diamonddave would n't have any exemption at all , even for people at or below poverty .
it was he who i was talking to originally , when you decided to butt in .
yep i think people should be taxed based on their income level .
who ever says taxes need to conform with the ideals of equality ?
i think men should be paid more based on having a dick .
see how that works ?
well at least you 're not claiming that everyone is equal in that department .
so that means if you have a dick you pay more in taxes too .
asterism has explained it very well but i would add ...
people still seem to think this is about income tax .
its not .
never has been .
ultimate loophole of all time is that wealth is taxed at a much lower rate than income .
ultra @-@ wealthy hide wealth and therefore pay no tax on it .
get it ?
i think you may not get it .
wealth is not taxed at all .
wealth is the net after taxes
income is taxed .
the ultra wealthy dont hide wealth .
they may hide income , and that is against the law ......
, but they do not gain anything if they hide wealth as one is not taxed on wealth .
and if i said __quant2__ wanted to tax aerospace companies in __name2__ state that gross over $ __quant1__ __quant2__ year , that would n't be the same thing as creating a tax on __name1__ aerospace , would it ?
not if __name1__ opts to make pencil erasers instead ....
or have a bad year and gross less than __quant1__ __quant2__ year .
i believe that is the point rdd is making .
the tax wouldnt be on __name1__ ...
it would be on any company that fits the criteria .
do n't be stupid .
of course it 's a tax on beoing .
a federal court ruled exactly that when the state of __name1__ tried to impose exactly such a tax .
that 's like saying i do n't have to pay income tax if i want to starve in some cave .
that has to be one of the most idiotic arguments ever posted on this board .
not if __name1__ opts to change their business model and no longer be in the aerospace industry .
regarding the proposed __quant2__ dollar earner tax · a __quant2__ dollar earner is taxed as a __quant2__ dollar earner only when he has an income of a __quant1__ dollars or more .
the following year he makes only 900k ?
he ios no longer being taxed as one earning a __quant1__ bucks .
now ...
i agree with your senmtiments about a tax on those earning a __quant1__ bucks or more ...
but i cant figure out why you cant see the point rdd and i are making .
he does n't get it , he won't ever get it .
apparently it 's too tough of a concept .
you 're the one who does n't get it .
the fact that you use some criteria to identify people to tax other than identifying them by name does n't mean you are n't discriminating against them by name .
i already posted you an example that proves my point .
you 're mad , are n't you ?
so , the left wants to redistribute wealth with taxation and that is n't an attempt to legislate some equality in wealth , right ?
not mad at all .
you 're just wrong .
no one wants to make us " all the same ".
that 's just your typical brainwashed bullshit that i hear all the time from the right .
you ask any progressive on here that same question and i doubt you 'd even get a positive response from one of them .
no one said the rich can n't be so .
that 's just __name1__ beckbaugh talking to your ignorant ass .
and that 's always the lefts excuse for denying what they really are .
believe it or night most people on the right do n't get __quant1__ marching orders from __name1__ or __name2__ .
do you see me accusing you of being a __name1__ or __name2__ parrott ?
the left wants equal outcomes .
how do i know that ?
look at the policies they push for .
giving more and more to the poor and taking more and more from the rich .
are you really trying to deny that ?
how can such policies result in anything but an equally mediocre society ?
freedom and safety are opposites where government is concerned .
the more you you gain of one the more you lose of the other and the simple fact is liberals value security more than freedom .
we can all strive for risk free lives , but keep in mind that is going to curtail the ability of anyone person to succeed much beyond another and believe it or not there are benefits to members of society defining and achieving measures of success as defined by themselves rather than government .
__value1__ % that was cut in the beginning of the __name1__ presidency was paid for by loans from __name2__ .
asking the rich to return to that sustainable level is hardly asking for more and more is it ?
tax policy should not be fair .
no one can agree on the definition of ' fair '.
the government should just tax those who can n't do anything about it .
that would be anyone with an addiction ( booze , gambling , sex , tobacco , reality tv audiences ...
etc ) and all left handed people named ' __value1__ '.
why do you hate left handed people ? !
you righty !
giving more and more for the poor and taking more and more from the rich .
no.
we just want a fair day 's pay for a fair day 's work ...
adjusted for inflation and cost of living .
simple as that .
unfortunately ...
the only people that get to decide what that fair day 's pay is ...
is the people who do n't want to give a fair day 's pay .
wrong .
work ethic makes that decision you even want more of the same ...
you applaud every time everyday workers lose their right to organize .
correct becuase we are seeing how unions protect those with the least acceptable work etyhic at the expense of those with the best possible work ethic you applaud every time the jobs go overseas ....
because it 's " their right " to do that .
wrong ...
we applaud __name1__ as a land of freedom of choices you applaud the gross tax evasion that those same entities are allowed to commit because " they are just trying to keep what is theirs " i never applauyd anyone who breaks the law..
all hail the plutocracy !
fuck the country , fuck the shrinking middle class , fuck the elderly , fuck the kids and most of all ...
fuck the poor .
i dont know man ...
i look at the poor in the __name1__ and i gotta tell ya ...
let them see what the poor live like in any other country and i bet they wouldnt be complaining .
the only people you feel are worthy of anything are the rich .
everyone else can go scratch their asses .
i do n't give a flying fuck how much other people have it seems quite apparent that is all you care about ...
but when a vast number of the people in this country can barely afford to keep a roof over their heads , really ?
where ?
sure , things are tight right now .....
but you see an ever growing homeless situation happening ?
how many people do you hear about starving to death ? ???
their families fed and pay their __quant1__ utilities , then you see reports on how the rich keep hauling money in at a record pace ...
well , if you can n't see the fucked up nature of that ...
all talking points..
and it is making you sound foolish then you are too indoctrinated to even debate with .
finally ...
the left 's excuse for " denying what they are "?
what ...
are you going to throw the " __value1__ " word out ?
i am not a fuckin ' marxist ...
that 's more of your brainwashed propaganda against the vast majority of our population ...
you know ...
the people who do the wealthy 's dirty work and get shit on at every turn ?
wow ...
an entire post of talking points .
they got ya hooked .
you are aware that " wealth " as opposed to income has already been taxed when it was income , correct ?
the __name1__ can not operate a nice welfare @/@ warfare state state with that attitude ! !!!!!!!
i disagree .
taxes can be entirely fair by assessing the same user fee to everybody who uses a service or product or government program .
if we go the income route , a tax can be entirely fair by assessing the same proportional percentage to all income regardless of socioeconomic standing .
the only way taxes will be ' fair ' is when they are not used to control , discipline , or manipulate people and @/@ or the economy .
taxes should be collected to run the necessary functions of government and for nothing else .
you even want more of the same ...
you applaud every time the jobs go overseas ....
you applaud the gross tax evasion that those same entities are allowed to commit because " they are just trying to keep what is theirs ".
i do n't give a flying fuck how much other people have ...
but when a vast number of the people in this country can barely afford to keep a roof over their heads , their families fed and pay their __quant1__ utilities , then you see reports on how the rich keep hauling money in at a record pace ...
then you are too indoctrinated to even debate with .
really ?
care to back up your " vast number "?
from where i sit , the vast number of people are n't holed up in some shanty eating shoe leather .
i 'm in a city with over a million people in the greater metro area .
the __name1__ folks are camped out a block from my downtown office .
the most i 've ever seen at one time is about a dozen people .
you 'd think that if the " vast number " are as poor off as you would have us believe , they 'd be swelling the ranks of the folks championing them , but they are n't .
why ?
they are at work putting a roof over their family 's head and living life .
look , you want to talk about fucked up , propaganda and indoctrination , you need to can that class warfare bullshit like , " the people who do the wealthy 's dirty work and get shit on at every turn " if you want to be taken seriously .
not some criteria ....
income .
nothing more , nothing less .
does it really matter whether you name them by individual name or simply by demographic ?
__value1__ href="http://www.usmessageboard.com/attachments/politics/16431d1323121673-should-tax-policy-be-fair-untitled2.bmp"> untitled2.bmp </a>
there just are not enough left handed guys named ' doug ' to cause much of a ruckus .
tax them at __value1__ % .
bull fuckin ' shit .
you know..
we can sit here and call each other names all night long .
work ethic means nothing when it comes to compensation .
you could be the best fuckin ' ditchdigger in the world ...
and guess what ?
odds are you still are n't going to be able to raise a family on it .
and before you even start ...
there are a hell of a lot of people out there that will never be anything more than a menial labor kind of worker .
your problem is ...
you seem to think that they do n't deserve a decent life in this country because they may not have the brains to get educated or the business savvy to run their own .
you are an elitist who only cares about the elite .
and the only reason you are so infatuated with such a small number of employees( unionized ) is that the idiots on the radio tell you to be .
you have not a fucking clue ...
not one .
oh i know ...
next you 'll be telling me how you either worked with , or was a union member at one time and they were all jackoffs ...
that 's just message board fodder because no one can prove it ...
so i do n't believe it .
it does n't matter whether it 's income or the color of their skin , it 's still discrimination .
what if the government placed a tax on people who could n't speak __name1__ ?
all you leftist turds would be howling about that , would n't you ?
yet , to avoid it , all you have to do is learn __name1__ .
how is that any different in nature than a graduated income tax ?
because thats basing a tax on something arbitrary .
what i 'm talking about is basing tax solely on dollars earned .
holy fuck you 're an idiot .
serious question , whats the highest level of education you completed ?
and what do you do for a living ?
i hear a lot these days about asking people and companies to pay their “ fair share ” in taxes .
while i ’m not sure what a “ fair share ” is ( it seems that everyone believes they are paying a “ fair share ” or more of their own income already ) , i wonder if that should be the deciding factor .
should tax policy be “ fair , ” or should it focus more on what is best for the country ?
we have a determinable tax base from which to draw these revenues , so let ’s assume that expected revenue , without difficult to support gdp changes based upon certain plans , remains the same .
how would you divide the taxpaying “ pie ” between the various income levels ?
we could conclude that it was the most beneficial to reduce the levels paid by the lower income levels , in order to spur consumption .
lower income households would tend to immediately spend those additional dollars on things they either want or need .
of course , since many of the products that are purchased by this group are made in china , it may not spur our economy to the extent you would think , and it would most certainly reduce the country ’s saving rate and dollars available for investment , but there is a case to be made that it would increase economic activity , at least in the short term .
if instead you reduce the levels paid by the upper income levels , those additional dollars will likely not be immediately spent , but invested in ( hopefully ) some productive endeavor .
again , some ( probably fairly sizeable ) percentage of those funds would also find their way to __name1__ as investments in plant or equipment , or in purchases of business assets .
however , the savings rate of the country and the total pool of private capital would increase , theoretically spurring business investment .
setting aside what is “ fair ”, which do you think provides the best chance for long @-@ term growth and prosperity ?
is there an optimum level where consumers have enough to spend and the pool of capital is adequate ?
government has no business being anything other than impartial .
either it establishes and serves justice or it is at war with justice .
can n't have it both ways .
lol .
yeah you 're tearing my argument to pieces .
a fellow conservative even tried to explain this to you and asked why you can n't grasp this .
not every conservative has a firm grasp on every issue .
conservatives in this forum post all kinds of stuff that is just plain wrong .
that 's because they were all educated by __name1__ indoctrinators .
they mistakenly believe some of the swill they were spoon @-@ fed in government schools .
i ask about your schooling and job because i need to know if i 'm actually dealing with someone who has the capability enough to use his brain to hold a job or achieve some sort of degree .
i have serious doubts at this point .
no , you 're simply a leftwing jackass who is losing the argument .
you have n't really thought about the stuff you believe in , so it 's easy for someone who has to tear you apart .
you are n't fooling anyone by attacking my schooling or my mental capabilities .
anyone with a brain can see who is losing this exchange .
i did n't attack your education or job .
i just inquired about it .
learn the difference ...
oh thats right , you can n't .
i 'm going to cut my losses and learn that talking to you is like explaining things to someone with severe autism and a severe delusions .
i 'm sorry you 're embarrassed by your lack of education and job .
it does explain a lot about you though .
the __name1__ seems to say it should .
btw , your avatar just cracks me up .
really nails __name1__ .
he tries to be the real thing but he 's a fake .
and , his darling little boy proves that the crumbs do n't fall far from the fruitcake .
i 'd give a lot for a real libertarian to run but __name1__ and his nasty little plutocrat son ain't it .
i knew __name1__ back in the 70 s .
i had worked with __name1__ who was registered __name2__ but who was really a closet libertarian .
i 'm afraid real libertarians are long gone now .
nah , you 're wrong about __name1__ .
you can insult me all you want .
like i give a shit .
lol !
but you do n't know anything about __name1__ .
he 's an educated & experienced physician who also served his nation honorably in our military .
what have you ever done for this country ?
you just sound like another spoiled entitlement brat .
you and __name1__ .
so why are you so angry with them ?
you really are n't any different .
you are on the same team .
first i was n't insulting you .
anyone who would post that avatar does n't think much of __name1__ and i was insulting him and his posing as a libertarian .
second , you do n't have a friggin clue about " entitlements " v . __name1__ .
did you even think this through before you said those __quant1__ are the same or even related ?
entitlements are earned by real people who work for many years for real companies .
the __name1__ mess was caused by just the opposite .
why do n't you know that ?
do you have parents who get __name1__ ?
talk to them .
if you were a libertarian , you would be very angry with __name1__ .
now i see that you 're just a kid who thinks a president with a light saber would be cool or some such silliness .
well , good luck with that and be sure to vote for __name1__ .
i bet you get told you 're not a very good listener all the time huh ?
read and comprehend .
try it .
who knows , you may even like it .
i am very angry with __name1__ for always demanding their handouts from taxpayers .
but i 'm also angry with many of you in the __name1__ movement who do the same thing .
you both have an entitlement attitude .
i think you both need to stop demanding handouts .
we 're broke for god 's sake .
enough is enough .
why do some of you keep saying that __name1__ fat cats are the same as the working class who pay into their entitlements and then want to draw on them when they retire ?
what makes you think __name1__ is " stealing " from fellow citizens ?
jeez .
you just make it up as you go along , do n't you .
i 'm not " in " the __name1__ movement .
i 've never demanded or gotten a handout .
i 've worked for everything i have , i 'm comfortable and no , you can n't have it to give to the __value1__ % .
and , if you think " we 're broke ", you have n't been paying attention .
educate yourself and stop thinking that __name1__ is going to save you .
then why are they protesting ?
they can still do that .
that has n't changed .
they just want their taxpayer freebies just like __name1__ does .
it is ' generation gimme .
' but we just can n't afford them .
no it 's just that people like you can n't be honest .
it is all about demanding those taxpayer freebies .
does n't matter to me you wont admit that .
but it is reality .
take a closer look at their signs and listen to what __name1__ is really saying .
it is all about the entitlements .
they have their hands out and so does __name1__ .
and they 're not even occupying the right places anyway .
they should be in __name1__ because that 's where all the real problems are .
__name1__ and __name2__ are just in competition with each other for their handouts .
they stand for the same basic entitlement philosophy .
question .
you truly believe that the people who have lost their entire life in this economic meltdown by @-@ way of foreclosure , as a direct result of the real sense of entitlement and irresponsibility of investors , are in fact similarly motivated ?
i think there is a broader view of holding people accountable that your conveniently ignore with your argument .
__name1__ gets bailed out , then gives multi @-@ __quant1__ dollar bonuses in the very same year .
that 's entitlement .
average __name1__ has his house foreclosed on by the very banks he is paying to bail out , and wants answers and recompense .
entitlement or accountability and justice ?
common sense tells us that bankers that have to sell their __value1__ vacation home are the one 's with entitlement issues .
not the people that want them to pay their share of the tax burden which they very much are responsible for .
why did they lose their entire life ?
and why is that other taxpayers ' fault .
you do n't get to demand stealing from fellow citizens just because your life did n't turn out the way you wanted .
that 's the same exact mentality __name1__ has .
if your problem is with the banks , then sue the banks and try to get some money out of them .
i have no problem with that .
but your real problem is still with __name1__ .
they gave __name1__ all that taxpayer cash .
you guys are occupying the wrong places .
get to __name1__ .
but do n't demand your fellow citizens pay for your own mistakes or problems with banks .
we 're broke .
the entitlement gravy train is off the tracks and out of gravy .
so to clarify , bankers/investors/lobbyist take knowingly absurd risks and engage in frivolous and unwarranted spending with money people have entrusted them as their futures ( home , retirement , college , etc ) .
then , the bubble bursts and we have to assign accountability .
ready , go ...
the lawmakers choice to bail out the banks is an entirely separate issue of accountability .
that legislation was headed by __name1__ under the __name2__ administration but was very partisan in nature , however measures of spending accountability were absolutely mishandled .
but again totally different argument .
responsibility for the event lies with ... ?
well see , there 's your own entitlement attitude slipping out .
just sounds like you 're blaming everyone else for your own mistakes .
that 's just way too common in the __name1__ movement .
i 'm not defending big banks that got taxpayer bailouts but citizens have to be held accountable too .
they played a big part in the economic collapse .
bad decisions and greed is what got a whole lot of citizens in trouble too .
but anyway , if you want to blame __name1__ for all your problems then go for it .
sue them and try to get some money out of them .
but do n't demand fellow citizens @/@ taxpayers pay for your mistakes .
the gravy train really is all out of gravy .
for some reason you remind me of __name1__ ( video has a few f @-@ bombs if your at work )
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oavoqfou0dq"> __name1__ dennis __name2__ - youtube </a>
yea it does seem that most in the __name1__ movement want to blame everyone but themselves for their own mistakes .
that 's why i can no longer support them .
they had it right in the beginning when it was about being angry at __name1__ .
i could get behind that .
but then it became all about the entitlement attitude .
' generation gimme ' stepped in and hijacked the movement .
now i just see them as entitlement whiners .
and i think most __name1__ are now seeing them that way too .
anyway , thanks for the hilarious vid .
it is classic .
it 's all about the taxpayer @-@ funded freebies in the end for both __name1__ and __name2__ .
they want to steal from fellow taxpayers to better themselves .
they 're demanding their handouts .
what do we do now with this self @-@ entitlement monster ?
the well 's run dry . we 're broke .
thats why i liked them at first too ...
but when the cries for a " guaranteed middle class job out of college " and " i should n't have to pay off my loans " amongst others started being more prevelant than anything else i became disgusted by them .
if the __name1__ stopped being about fiscal conservatism and the debt and transformed into a conservative social issues movement i would feel the same sense of disgust toward it .
yea i think good honest people were there at the start of the movement .
but they were quickly booted and replaced with ' generation gimme ' whiners .
and i 'm sure __name1__ had a hand in hijacking the movement too .
it is sad but that 's where it stands currently .
i can no longer support them .
uncle ferd says its kinda like buyin ' a car from a used car lot - it ain't as good as it looks ...
half of unemployment rate decline due to people giving up job search , labor data show · __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ – half of the __value1__ percent decline in the nation ’s unemployment rate is due to people giving up hope of finding a job and leaving the labor force altogether in __month2__ , government data and __name1__ calculations show .
in the month of __month1__ , __quant1__ people left the labor force altogether , the __name1__ ( bls ) reported on friday .
the unemployment rate , reported today , has declined by __value1__ percent – from __value2__ in __month1__ to __value3__ percent in __month2__ .
however , had those __quant1__ people not left the labor force , the unemployment rate would have been __value1__ percent – __value3__ percent higher than the officially @-@ reported __value2__ percent rate for __month1__ .
the unemployment rate went down for two reasons : the economy created __quant1__ jobs and __quant2__ people left the labor force in __month1__ .
if those who had left the labor force are added back into it and added to the ranks of the unemployed – because they do not have jobs – the small decline in the unemployment rate is cut in half – to __value1__ percent .
in __month1__ , the size of the labor force was __quant1__ people and __quant2__ were unemployed .
in __month1__ , the labor force was __quant1__ people and __quant2__ were unemployed .
other __name1__ data show the true jobless nature of the current economy .
despite the __quant1__ jobs added in __month1__ , the overall population grew by 172,000 , meaning that there are not enough jobs being created to keep up with population growth .
those __quant1__ people went right into the ranks of those who are not in the labor force at all , a figure which rose to 86.6 million in __month1__ , up 487,000 during the month .
secondly , the number of those who “ want a job now , ” according to the __name1__ , rose 192,000 in __month1__ , going from 6.4 to 6.55 million people in __month1__ .
<a href="http://cnsnews.com/news/article/half-unemployment-rate-decline-due-people-giving-job-search-labor-data-show"> source </a>
so we 've heard __quant1__ years worth of __name1__ whining like his __name2__ peasants , him mostly whining about a " do nothing __name3__ " and the " __name4__ obstruction " stopping him from doing anything .
now unemployment is down to __value1__ % .
and libtards are dropping to their knees to praise him ! !!!
why ?
ceo 's approved this hiring .
corporations funded it .
__name2__ has been hampered by a " do nothing __name1__ " and " __name3__ obstructionists "......
right ?
so when shit goes bad , __name3__ is immune from blame , because a do @-@ nothing __name1__ and the __name2__ are preventing him from dong anything .
but when things go well , he gets immediate credit , despite the fact that all that new hiring is being done by the very ceo 's and corporations he and his ilk spew verbal venom at every chance they get .
thanks to all the ceo 's and corporations for taking the chance to go ahead and hire .
we know , with __name1__ in office the future is very unknown and shaky , but you guys hired anyway .
keep up the good work .
and __name1__ ...
try not to fuck it up .
of course , you cant't do much with a do @-@ nothing __name1__ , so not sure why you got credit for it anyway .
ceo 's were hiring--
" i 'm saying it bluntly , that this administration is the greatest wet blanket to business , progress and job creation in my lifetime .
a lot of people do n't want to say that .
they 'll say , ' oh __name2__ , do n't be attacking __name1__ .
' well , this is __name1__ 's deal , and it 's __name1__ that 's responsible for this fear in __name2__ ."
" the guy [ __name1__ ] keeps making speeches about redistribution , and maybe ' we ought to do something to businesses that do n't invest or hold too much money .
' we have n't heard that kind of talk except from pure socialists ."
" business is being hammered .
the business community in this country is frightened to death of the weird political philosophy of the president of the __name1__ .
until he 's gone , everybody 's going to be sitting on their thumbs ."
__name1__ wynn--democrat--ceo
__name1__ steve __value1__ 's __name2__ __value1__ obama __value1__ he right ? </a>
<a __name1__ cbs news </a>
i can n't blame a corporation for not hiring .
of course progressives believe its a companies job to hire because money grows on trees ...
if i was a ceo i 'd piss out my office window ...
hahahaha
" look its raining over me but not over anyone else thats weird __name1__ must have been resurrected -@ ts a sign from __name2__ "
well __name1__ wynn--a __name2__ home boy--and ceo says screw __name3__ they arent ' going to hire until obama is gone .
i do n't know how much clearer than you can be than that ?
if i was in charge of hiring i would do whats in my companies best interests ...
hiring redundant workers would n't be one of my priorities..
i 'm sure __name1__ expect companies to hire for no reason ...
if they do n't they 're rich snobs ...
__name1__ see companies the same way they see government : an entity that exists solely to support a person without holding that person any way accountable or expecting anything in return .
it 's __name1__ 's moral responsibility to hire , pay and care for hordes of left wingers .
pay them just to ...
well , show up and blog and drink coffee .
this is what i 've been trying to say all day .
despite how much the dems have warned that cutting govt would derail the recovery - govt continues to shed jobs and yet the private sector continues to pick up .
this is a slap in the fact for big govt dems who cry out at even the littlest cut to govt .
which ceos , specially , do we thank ?
wow
a right @-@ winger admitting unemployment is actually down .
i guess __name1__ only gets credit when unemployment goes up
i think it is a safe and secure answer to the question ; " why are you a liberal ? "
because i do n't want to be associated with bucs90 .
start with the one that pays you .
because , unless you are a government employee , a ceo is in charge of you being employed and paid .
that " ceo " might be mom or pop and their community grocery store .
it might be the ceo of __name1__ or __name2__ .
it might be the ceo who owns wealthy , but local , food chains , like __name2__ 's __name1__ , or the south 's __name3__ a.
but if you work , and you are n't a gov't employee , then somewhere out there is a person who enables your continued employment .
not saying we must kiss anyones ass .
not saying we " owe " them anything .
they ask for a job to be done , we ask for payment .
so long as both keep doing their part , the deal is going .
so , i thank the ceo who decided to keep my position funded , and the manager who hired me .
we are supposed to thank the president everyday ....
because he makes all this possible .
there has got to be a way that we can all hook up to a service like " __name1__ " annonymously next __month1__ __day1__ th .
i would pay a fair sum to be able to see the looks on the faces of these crazy people .
well it would be a change from the foul abuse he 's had so far , but if obama walked on water , a hypocrite like you would report " __name1__ can n't swim "
you are a drone compared to president __name1__ .....
a true __name1__
actually , there 's nothing to thank ceo 's or __name1__ for in these numbers .
you drill down into them , they are pretty awful .
__value1__ , the economy only produced __quant1__ jobs in __month1__ .
150,000 is considered baseline growth .
the reason the number dropped was that the " __name1__ " only counts those who are employed or looking for work , not those who have given up because unemployment benefits have run out or they find they can get buy without working .
__quant1__ people dropped out of the workforce altogether .
also , most of these jobs that were created were low paying ones .
hospitality and retail jobs that were created for the holiday rush .
a lot of these jobs will be eliminated when demand goes down after the holidays .
looming on the horizon , the euro @-@ crash and state and local governments having to slash payrolls to meet budget shortfalls .
private sector payrolls were up 140,000 .
but as has been happening month after month ,
government payrolls were down .
down __quant1__ last month .
the size of government has been shrinking dramatically ...
just as conservatives claim they want and just as conservatives claim is good for jobs and the economy .
so why are n't you happy ?
instead of trying to blame __name1__ for tepid job growth ...
the tepid growth is because of policy dufus .
so how many threads do we need to show how really , really stupid we can be ? ?
if anyone actually thinks the employment market is better , why do n't you go see how many of your neighbors have recently found a job .
well other than part time , seasonal work which won't even qualify them for ue benefits .
__value1__ % unemployment is an accomplishment ?
it is ! !
__name1__ are celebrating the manipulation of numbers .
“ i helped __name1__ and __name2__ develop supply side economics .
i helped lead the effort to defeat __name1__ in the __name2__ .”
__name1__ href="http://visiontoamerica.org/5959/gingrich-i-helped-defeat-communism/"> gingrich : i helped lead the effort __name2__ defeat communism </a>
wow , he did so much .
he " helped " __name1__ and __name2__ .
i 'm sure they need it .
a lot .
and , he was " one of the leaders " that defeated __name1__ .
who were the other ones ?
i did n't realize he did so much .
and , he did all that between ethics violations and affairs .
and even made a __quant1__ dollars .
what a guy !
he was there .
you trying to re @-@ write history again ?
i think that 's the point of the thread , charles .
go __name1__ ! !!
fuck you commies ! !!
go __name1__ , go __name1__ , go __name1__ ! !!
i hope he governs far to the right of __name1__ ever imagined of governing ! !!
why ?
my guess would be because he is right wing , and wants right wing government ?
lol
again i ask ...
why ?
what is so cool about right wing governance ?
the man has a huge ego and will lie about anything
kinda like __name1__ , __name2__ ?
what did they lie about ?
dean you know you like " trickel down "
just admit it .
like the " pearl necklace " you were given ?
i agree with ya dean ....
that fat fucker should get together with __name1__ and have a talk show ....
the stories about the stuff they have done would be great radio ....
al gore ?
tell me what it was he said .
tell the truth now .
i can spot a liar from here .
__value1__ href="http://www.snopes.com/quotes/internet.asp"> __name1__ al gore invented the internet </a>
despite the derisive references that continue even today , __name1__ did not claim he " invented " the internet , nor did he say anything that could reasonably be interpreted that way .
the " __name1__ said he ' invented ' the internet " put @-@ downs were misleading , out @-@ of @-@ context distortions of something he said during an
to claim that __name1__ was seriously trying to take credit for the " invention " of the internet is , frankly , just silly political posturing that arose out of a close presidential campaign .
__name1__ never used the word " invent , "
in __month1__ __year1__ , the organizers of the __name1__ for online achievements honored __name2__ with a lifetime achievement __name1__ for __quant1__ decades of contributions to the internet .
" he is indeed due some thanks and consideration for his early contributions , " said __name1__ .
oops .
get a room , you __quant1__ !
“ i helped __name1__ and __name2__ develop supply side economics .
i helped lead the effort to defeat __name1__ in the __name2__ .
that 's what makes it such a great ongoing joke !
just more lies and misinformation from right wing media ....
and they take it like a juicy worm on a hook .
it would be laughable if these types of things were n't destroying our country .
did i say __name1__ invented the internet ? ....
tell the truth now .....
but i will say the the fucker is a hypocrite who pollutes the environment just as much as the next guy ....
now between him and __name1__ they would have a lot of stories to tell about what they have done .....
oops .....
do you even pay attention to current events ?
or is __name1__ your only source of information ?
are you just in denial ?
does it make it easier for you to dislike him by deluding yourself into thinking he 's done nothing at all ?
here is a partial list :
- the __name1__ has created millions of jobs in the private sector .
even in light of this recent information , repubs still say it was a waste .
not true .
- the unemployment rate dropped from __value1__ % to __value2__ % .
( yes , it 's now at __value1__ % , but obviously we are better off than we could have been ) .
- __name1__ has made good on most of his campaign promises ( as reported by __name2__ ) .
- he has killed @/@ captured 5x as many __name1__ @-@ queda terrorists in his __value1__ __quant2__ years than __name2__ did in all his __quant1__ year presidency .
( do n't believe me ?
look it up .
in fact , __value1__ learned of this fact on __name1__ of all sources ) .
much has changed in america since __name1__ was sworn into office as the __value1__ th president of the __name2__ on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ .
in less than __quant1__ days as chief executive of the __name2__ , president __name1__ 's failed policies and initiatives have resulted in a dizzying array of dismal economic statistics .
as it stands now , __name1__ appears headed toward an economic legacy that may very well surpass __name2__ in its level of failure .
we have seen under this president an expanding number of citizens who are partially or wholly dependent on the government for their very livelihood , as the data show that the __name1__ has become an ever @-@ growing welfare state under __name2__ .
government dependence , which is defined as the percentage of persons receiving __quant1__ or more federal benefit payments , is at a staggering __value1__ % , its highest level in __name1__ history , while __quant2__ households are reliant on food stamps .
in fact , government spending on food stamps in __year2__ ($ __quant1__ ) was double what it was in __year1__ , with the __year3__ figure likely to be even higher .
according to the __month1__ employment report from the __name1__ , the nation 's unemployment rate remained at __value1__ % with a total of zero jobs added to the economy during the month .
among demographic groups , latinos had an unemployment rate of __value1__ % , while __name1__ @-@ __name1__ posted a rate of __value2__ % .
for blacks , that represents the highest unemployment rate for this group since __year1__ and a rate more than double that of whites ( __value1__ %) .
when __name1__ took office in __month1__ __year1__ , the nation 's unemployment rate stood at __value1__ % , a rate higher than the historic norm , yet far below the current rate , and above any rate during the __name2__ administration .
since __month1__ __year1__ , __quant3__ months into __name1__ 's term , the nation 's unemployment rate has been at or above __value1__ % during __quant1__ of __quant2__ consecutive months .
those are the official unemployment rates .
the real unemployment rate , as it is sometimes referred to , rose to a seasonally adjusted __value1__ % in __month1__ .
that rate , as defined by the __name1__ ,

he got our credit downgraded
he racked up deficits bigger than any __name1__ budget
are you just in denial ?
ya ....
no other president has ever accomplished getting our credit rating downgraded even once , and this one may even get it downgraded twice !
wow !
what a man !
false ....
i think it not only saved millions of jobs it actually created hundreds of millions if not close to 3 billion jobs ....
why is it that every time a lefty posts numbers as to what the __name1__ did the numbers get better and better in __name2__ 's favor .
the unemployment numbers suck after __quant1__ years so do n't even go there .
and __name1__ did n't kill __quant1__ single terrorist .
the military did .
-@ there is always churn in the jobs market , even during the depression , i assume you will provide proof that these jobs hes crated in the private sector are @- net jobs ?
because labor participation rates and the forgotten unemployed do n't seem to do it for me ....
-@ not all promises are equal , are they ?
and those ones he did n't deliver on ?
- hummm , so killing t 's etc. is a good thing now ?
i see .
__name1__ adds __quant1__ new jobs but unemployment rate unchanged
great news is n't it ?
but wait there 's more
the increase in employment partially reflected the return to payrolls of about 45,000 __name1__ telecoms workers who had been on strike in __month1__ .
the number of unemployed people , at __quant1__ , remained essentially unchanged in __month1__ .
__name1__ href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2011/oct/07/us-new-jobs-unemployment-rate"> __quant1__ adds 103,000 new jobs as unemployment rate __value2__ | __value1__ | guardian.co.uk </a>
so there were n't __quant1__ jobs added to the economy .
someone is cooking the numbers .
i wonder who ?
reach much ?
we were promised unemployment would never go above __value1__ % if we passed the __name1__ .
if you think 250,000 plus per " job " created was a good thing , then by all means it was a stunning success .
unemployment was never __value1__ % , and was lower than it has been under __name2__ , under __name1__ .
made good on his campaign promises which ones ?
closing __name1__ ?
uniting the world ?
not letting unemployment go above __value1__ % ?
being transparent ?
being bipartisan ?
wtf are you talking about ?
your claim that he has killed 3 times as many __name1__ qeada is completely false .
we killed thousands under __name1__ .
besides __name1__ is continuing __name2__ polices that he ( ran against ) in order to kill those terrorists .
__name1__ would still be alive if not for programs __name2__ started that __name3__ called wrong , and illegal , and then continued .
you are about as clueless as they come dude .
__name1__ has been a massive and utter failure .
worst leadership i have ever seen from any president ever .
the current debt crisis illustrates his lack of leadership for all to see .
he thinks he can just come up with a number and order __name1__ to figure out how to reach it .
he does not have the balls to put his own numbers on the table , and suggest how they pay for it .
because he is n't a leader , he is a perpetual campaigner and chief .
i am wrong about the unemployment rate , but every other point i made about __name1__ is true .
you can claim it 's false all you want , but facts are facts .
that is the denial that i referred to .
thank you for demonstrating my point .
when i have more time ( tomorrow ) , i will provide the sources for all of this information .
but really , if you were actually informed on current events , i would n't have to .
you forgot to include how he 's created the greatest divide between people in this country since the __name1__ .
then you should have waited until you had done the research first..
then posted your thread .
too late .
you do n't get a do over..
btw , when it comes to facts ...
yes you do ...
lol , i do n't get a " do over "?
what are you __quant1__ ?
the reason he 's smiling is because you and many others still believe his lie .
you 're not talking about current events .
you 're talking about __name1__ press releases .
reality steadfastly refuses to cooperate with leftist fantasy .
your question is not a question at all .
it 's your opinion .
unemployment ....
your side uses the excuse for the high number as " it would have been far worse "....
you nor anyone else does not know that .
there are no facts to support any of the numbers of " saved jobs "..
the only number that matters is the official unemployment number which is __value1__ %...
a number which the __name1__ admin attempts to pass off as " the new normal "..
spin .
this is such hypocrisy .
in __quant1__ instance your side states that businesses are not hiring .
they are sitting on over a __quant1__ dollars in cash .
on the other hand your side states that millions of private sector jobs have been created ...
so which is it ?
which is the lie ?
__name1__ has killed ?
ummm , not quite .
for that matter , no way .
__name1__ is coat tailing the operations set up by the previous admin .
the peopel serving in __name1__ and __name2__ deserve all of the credit .
__name1__ gets none .
so cut the bullshit .
no politician conservative or liberal gets the credit for military successes .
the fighting men and women get the credit because they did it .
you spew here what you claim to be facts .
in the absence of proof using links with facts , your post is opinion .
that 's that .
__name1__ 's policies are the most anti -@ business anti freedom and anti capitalist of any presidential admin in recent memory ...
except those of __name1__ .
now get to work and provide those links .
and be very careful from where you get your information .
it will be scrutinized .
we ask questions .
and question answers .
if you are an __name1__ sycophant , just be a stand up guy @/@ gal and admit it .
this would save everyone a lot of time .
" you must spread some rep around etc."
you 're giving __name1__ credit for that ?
do you watch __name1__ ?
i am .
and yet there are fewer jobs now than there were when he took office .
and yet to make this happen , the feds have reduced the jobs available number by about 2.5 million and that is why the unemployment rate has dropped .
without that change in the formula , the ue rate is still above __value1__ % .
close __name1__ , fix the worst economy since __name2__ , out of __name3__ , out of __name4__ , open and transparent government , end of crony capitalism , bi @-@ partisan cooperation and honesty .
0 for whatever in most of what he promised .
i suppose this beats trying them in courts .
eliminates the need to read rights if the suspects is lying around in several pieces .
the legal and humane way to arrest suspects .
everyone but foxbots realize he got a lot done before pubs started blocking everything __month1__ @/@ __year1__ @- now assume the position ...
care to list what he did that was beneficial ?
sure you can but let 's really give __name2__ credit for helping americas enemy in __name1__ .
__name1__ qudea
__name1__ has done more than that .
and , he was an incredible state senator and __name1__ senator .
__name1__ can n't get passed the black .
you get them calling __name1__ " man @-@ child " at __quant1__ years old ( code for boy ) and " magic negro " and so on .
the list is endless .
they constantly try a lame attempt that __name1__ was made fun of so it 's ok if they do it too .
when you point out that __name2__ , at one time , was the most popular president in history , they make up even more lame excuses that __name1__ were " afraid " of not supporting him .
ok , then they did support him .
which was it , they did or did n't .
the __name1__ is __value1__ % white , old and based in the __name2__ .
they are acting the way conservatives have for over a __quant1__ years .
it 's who they are .
they just hate __name1__ .
many of the things they say are so fantastic , they would never say those things about anyone else .
anti christ ?
really ?
i guess it 's just different ...
somehow ...
when leftists do it .
dave are you shocked that __quant1__ idiots agreeing about __name1__ ?
then he certainly deserves credit for what 's happening now .
where 's your links for all of these " accomplishments ?
i believe that is the procedure here .
it doesnt matter how many times you say it , the __name1__ failed .
the economy is worse than ever .
__name1__ accomplished nothing , nothing good anyway ,
he did manage to take a bad situation and make it worse
i knew that card was gonna get played by someone ....
care to list what he did that was beneficial ?
key word .
good grief , why ?
never .
they do n't want to hear about that or what 's happening in __name1__ .
is this what __name1__ supported in __name2__ ?
torture
so you are claiming __quant1__ hugely unpopular pieces of legislation as victory ?
ramming through health care , __name1__ , and __name2__ @/@ __name2__ against the will of the people is all you have to hold on to ?
sucks to be you .
__name1__ were given the power to block __name2__ 's agenda after only __quant1__ years for a reason .
people do n't like __name1__ 's agenda .
idiot .
apparently billy000 is unfamiliar with __name1__ plant stories .
this has been going on for __quant1__ .
charts and graphs ....
anyone can create those .
especially one which owes it 's existence to the present presidential administration .
" obamadiary "?
please .
look chrissie , at the end of the day , the economy is crawling along at about __value1__ % __quant1__ growth .
the __name1__ has had it 's credit rating lowered twice .
spending is at historic highs with this admin spending more than all others combined .
unemployment is still at __value1__ % plus .
our southern border is still a pipeline for illegal immigration and drug trafficking .
gitmo is still open .
we 're having to endure news stories of our troops being killed by roadside bombs in __name1__ .
we still have a president that has no energy policy other than to kowtow to environmental lobbyists .
the housing market is still being manipulated by a meddling and intrusive federal government .
we still have a federal government that goes around suing states for trying to do within the law what the __name1__ will not regarding illegal immigration .
we have a federal government acting in deference to unions and union activists , attempting to stop a major aircraft firm from doing business where it sees fit ....
you can post all the charts and graphs you wish .
it does n't matter .
until __name1__ and __name2__ ave gets out of the way of main street , nothing will change .
good grief chris , pull your head out of those dark places and read some facts .
your posts are ridiculous .
that 's not my post .
gettin worried , are n't ya ?
you should be .
obamabots believe __name1__ does n't lie .
reality , of course , disagrees .
i 'm shocked he was even elected ...
i 've been familiar with __name1__ since the 90 's and the platform he ran on in 08 was nothing but lies ...
the guy is a lying racist elitist __name1__ ...
apparently the majority of who voted for him did n't read " __name1__ " or even bothered to check his voting history ...
i would certainly label him a narcissist or a psychopath .
everything he does is to keep his power base .
he does n't care about anyone but himself - as a matter of fact i believe hes obsessed with himself ...
this dickhead threw his own mother under the bus who raised him then praised his drunk __name1__ father ( which he only met a few times ) to score brownie points with self loathing white progressives .
now , now , the press asked him some pretty hard @-@ hitting and no @-@ nonsense questions like : " so , senator __name1__ ...
just exactly how awesome are you , anyway ?
the people have a right to know ! "
pretty much
it 's worse in __name1__ - you 'd think the guy was the __value1__ coming ...
__name1__ worships the ground he walks on ( or any progressive for that matter ) while they degrade any __name2__ they can..
it 's a shame , such a great state as il saddled with that shithole of corruption .
the non @-@ partisan assessment on __name1__ 's campaign promises :
__name2__ href="http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/obameter/"> politifact | the obameter __name1__ tracking obama 's campaign promises </a>
article explaining the success of __name2__ 's __name1__ in creating millions of jobs :
__name1__ href="http://www.examiner.com/liberal-in-national/cbo-states-obama-economic-stimulus-created-or-saved-5-million-or-more-jobs"> __name3__ states __name2__ economic stimulus created or saved 5 million or more jobs - national __name4__ | examiner.com </a>
it figures .
" national liberal "..
the __name1__ ...
now there 's __quant1__ entities that have zero interest in keeping __name1__ in the __name2__ .
__name1__ is a liberal blog .
ah the this cite is bias and the __name1__ doesnt jive with my opinion right now so i wont use it .
here 's the problem , you walking obscenity , it is not opinion .
it 's fact .
there is no possible way the __name1__ 's or any of the various blogs cited numbers here can work .
the federal government 's own unemployment figures and the current condition of the housing and other consumer markets belie any published numbers handed out by the left , the __name1__ or __name2__ .
so go ahead and process that for a while .
i for one would be thrilled to see unemployment lowered , more people making money .
that increases economic activity which stimulates business activity which translates to prosperity .
the current presidential administration will not let that happen .
i think my favorite question for president __name2__ was , " who is you favorite __name1__ player ? "
not because of the question , but because of the answer .
" i , uh ...
well ...
um ...
that 's...
uh ...
you know ...
i like the __name1__ too ! "
been drinking the cool aide ain't ya billy ?
__name1__ ain't offered shit !
he ...
has been missing in action through this whole thing .
as a matter of fact , the __value1__ thing he did when he came back to town was to give companies another tax loop hole ...
you know , like the ones he claims he wants to close ...
only this one is so magnanimous that he thinks we won't call it what it is .
see , it 's a tax break to companies and corporations that hire vets .
take that __name1__ !
ain't that wonderful of the man ?
set up a system to fail so that it cuts the defense budget in half , puts thousands of soldiers in harm 's way without the equipment they need and then give corporations tax breaks to hire them when they come back in wheel chairs and on crutches .
wonderful man ain't he ?
this is exactly what __name1__ and the __name2__ wanted to happen with that stupid super committee crap in exchange for raising the debt ceiling in the __value1__ place .
if you doubt it , just look at the ideologues they put on the thing .
the only mistake the __name1__ made was in voting to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for anything short of repealing __name2__ and passing the ryan budget that actually would have cut __quant1__ out of the budget .
this president and the __name1__ has not only not passed , but has not even offered a budget since __name2__ took office ...
little on offered some grand deficit reduction scheme .
something that i might add has never happened before in the history of this country and they damn well could have done since they controlled both houses of __name1__ for the __value1__ __quant1__ years __name2__ has been in office .
900+ days with out a budget and in contempt of the __name1__ .
by the way , the truth of the super committee negotiations is that the __name1__ did n't off __quant1__ single plan .
the __name1__ offered several and the last one that the democrats rejected out of hand actually included closing the tax loop holds you mistakenly seem to think the __name2__ want .
however , as i said , they rejected it out of hand .
they really only want to say they want to close the loop holes .
they do n't want to get caught actually doing it by their corporate masters and fat cat donors !
what put the troops in " harm 's way " was invading __name1__ for oil..
and nation building in __name1__ .
done right..
there would have been no or little loss of life and the whole war on terror would have been over in several weeks..
with __name1__ dead and buried .
instead what we got was a big fucking mess .
thanks to bozos like __name1__ and __name2__ .
true .
wow , you __name1__ are really into denial .
okay here it is .
proof !
__name1__ :
" the __name1__ that i signed into law last month will cut __quant1__ government spending by about $ __quant2__ over the next __quant3__ years .
it also charges the __name1__ with finding an additional $ __quant1__ in savings .
as part of this jobs bill , i am asking the __name2__ to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the __name1__ .
in addition , i believe that the __name1__ should seize the opportunity that this new committee presents and do much more so that we can put the country on a sustainable fiscal path , which is critical for our long @-@ term economic growth and competitiveness .
for this reason , i am sending to the __name1__ this detailed plan to pay for this jobs bill and realize more than $ __quant1__ in net deficit reduction over the next __quant2__ years .
combined with the approximately $ __quant3__ __quant1__ in savings from the __value1__ part of the __name1__ , this would generate more than $ __quant2__ in deficit reduction over the next decade .
this would bring the nation to the point where current spending is no longer adding to our debt and where our debt is no longer increasing as a share of our economy--an important milestone on the way to restoring fiscal discipline and moving us toward balance ."
[ living within our means and investing in the future : the president 's plan for economic growth and deficit reduction , __value1__ , __month1__ __year1__ ]
there you go .
can n't argue with facts .
however , it should be noted that many __name1__ did n't support the bill either .
i never said __name1__ should n't be to blame for impeding __name2__ .
contrary to what __name2__ will tell you , __name1__ is on the center of the political spectrum .
he has been criticized by __name1__ for being too diplomatic .
in other words , do n't blame __name1__ .
blame all of __name1__ .
parroting a bunch of comments on the the __name1__ website is not ' proof ' of anything other than it was ' promised '.
do you have the actual bill he proposed , showing the savings mentioned above ?
i did not " parrot " a bunch of comments together .
that is an exact quote taken directly from __value1__ .
come on , is it really that hard to believe ?
it 's right there in front of you .
i did not say ' parrot a bunch of comments together ', implying you 'd mixed a bunch of stuff together ...
you read my comment incorrectly .
i said .
parroting something from the __name1__ website does n't count as proof that __name2__ ever actually submitted what the comments promised .
i want a link to the bill , __name2__ or __name3__ , that __name1__ introduced , which ' would ' be considered proof .
is that so hard for you to understand ?
what exactly would stop __name1__ from sending it to the __name2__ ?
he did n't say he was in the process of making the bill .
the bill was already finalized .
he sent the bill and it was rejected .
i guess will look for the proof that he sent the bill to __name1__ , but i do n't understand why you need that level of proof .
where do i even look for something like that ?
okay , here is the next best thing .
an outside news article confirming it .
it 's amazing how easy it is to find this stuff with a simple __name1__ search .
you should try it sometime .
__name1__ href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-13/politics/obama.deficits_1_spending-cuts-deficit-reduction-tax-hikes?_s=pm:politics"> obama __quant1__ 4 __value1__ in __name2__ ; gop assails call for tax __name3__ - cnn </a>
same ole same ole , the __name1__ just says something and these clowns eat it up without question .
no scrutiny needed , the messiah said it , it 's true .
there you go , believing the liar in chief and calling it proof .
and billy goes wa wa wa all the way home .
still tore up the deal .
why ?
because it included taxing the wealthy .
it 's absolutely ridiculous .
__name1__ @/@ __name2__ are always touting that taxing the wealthy would n't make a big dent in the deficit , which is true .
however , just because it 's a small dent , it does n't mean that it should n't be included in the proposal .
the tax hikes on the rich that __name1__ proposed would have reduced the deficit by __quant1__ dollars .
as small as that amount is toward reducing the deficit , is n't it a good compromise on the issue of taxes considering that the proposal totalled __quant1__ all together in cuts ?
can the rich really not handle being slightly less rich than they could be for the sake of getting the country back on track ?
now , all we have to show for it is __quant1__ in automatic cuts .
you are liar .
but you think a cut __quant1__ years out is a cut proving your stupidity .
it 's a cut over __quant1__ years .
you obviously do n't know how these things work ....
" the budget control act that i signed into law last month will cut __quant1__ government spending by about $ __quant2__ over the next __quant3__ years .
as part of this jobs bill ( lie __value1__ .
it was the " the budget control act " but he tried to claim it was a jobs bill when in fact it was a deal to increase the debt ceiling .
just more political posturing with no real intent ) , i am asking the __name2__ to increase that amount so that it covers the full cost of the __name1__ jobs act .
( bull shit call number __value1__ . he and the demwhits negotiated a deal to increase the debt ceiling and before the ink on it had dried , reneged on the deal and attempted to tie it to his " __name1__ " wish list which would add another __quant1__ dollars to the deficit now ! ) in addition ...
( on and on he drones with no intent of acting .)
there you go .
can n't argue with facts ....
__value1__ , let me address this " budget control act " crap .
the only fact in that is that he signed the bill ...
under protest i might add .
just when was that little bit of legislation signed into law ?
oh yeah , __year1__ !
this law was the bill passed in exchange for raising the debt ceiling .
__name1__ had to be dragged kicking and screaming to accept even this tiny little bit of fiscal reform in order to avoid the __name2__ defaulting on its debt .
so that is bull shit !
as to the rest of that lunatic ranting and political positioning on __value1__ , there was no bill introduced ever !
why ...
because __name1__ did n't want to get attached to a stand alone piece of legislation that raised taxes on anyone while adding __quant1__ dollars in deficit spending .
they , just like anyone who actually understands this stuff and the mood of __name1__ know that __value1__ % of americans do not favor tax hikes or increased deficits .
just about as many did not favor extending unemployment benefits .
and nearly __value1__ % do n't believe there will be any benefit from the " __name1__ jobs act " or " __name2__ " after his moronic , "...
shovel ready were n't so shovel ready " slip of the tongue .
next , the bill he signed had to be passed by a __name2__ __name1__ to even get to obummer 's desk .
so to portray __name1__ as obstructionist is disingenuous to say the least and a flat out lie in the fact of it !
he and the __name1__ got damn near everything they wanted and they still reneged on it before the ink was dry .
this thing has gone just exactly as the __name1__ hoped .
however , they have misunderestimated the __name1__ people once again .
" we the people " ain't buying the crap he 's shoveling .
and when __year1__ rolls around ...
that will be made clear !
oh , nearly forgot to mention .
if you actually do read the links conservative posted , you will find that the __name2__ controlled __name1__ has passed some 22 pieces of budget and deficit reduction legislation in the last year __quant1__ and not one has been brought to the floor of the __name3__ by dirty harry .
just who is the obstructionist ?
you are really tap @-@ dancing around this issue .
the entire point i am trying to make was that __name1__ did in fact introduce legislation while you claimed ( and apparently are still claiming ) never happened .
are you just ignoring the __name1__ link i posted ?
also , what you think about the __name1__ and __name2__ is irrelevant .
mostly because i am not defending the __name1__ in __name2__ .
and you are wrong about __name1__ ' attitudes towards tax hikes .
most __name1__ agree that there should be tax hikes on the wealthy , which has been __name2__ 's position since the beginning .
this radical , one @-@ sided believe you have toward politics is laughable .
to put all of the blame on __name1__ @/@ __name2__ for __name3__ 's troubles shows that you really do not know much about these american issues .
is __name1__ all you watch ?
that is sad .
great quote .
i think it speaks volumes coming from an independent rather than a __name1__ sounding like a broken record .
the president 's " offer " included $ __quant1__ in new spending .
that 's a non @-@ starter .
no __name1__ is going to vote to give the president another slush fund to pay off union supporters with , especially since a portion of that money will end up in __name2__ campaign coffers in the form of union dues .
also , as always , his proposal consisted of tax increases immediately and all the cuts back loaded over a __quant1__ year period .
in other words , the " cuts " were purely imaginary .
do you turds actually believe no one is wise to your scams ?
exactly .
i can n't believe that any wingnuts would have the balls to bring up anything to do with " putting troops in harms way " after their support of the __name1__ invasion and occupation .
i have and do support going into __name3__ after __name2__ however and so did __name1__ at first .
but then later he said " i do n't know where __name1__ is .
i have no idea and really do n't care .
it 's not that important .
it 's not our priority ."
sure you did , and i 'm the queen of __name1__ .
getting the country on track would be removing __name1__ from office .
that is all .
like __name1__ ?
can you post this " torn @-@ up bill " for us to see ?
obummer .
i really am fascinated by all these whimsical nicknames thrown out by individuals such as this .
i really should catalogue them , just so i can provide at a moment 's notice a reference to all the ' sage ' things they come up with .
i notice it just as much on these forums as i do anywhere else on the internet .
it 's in the __name1__ .
childish name calling appeals to children .
actions by some of the protestors ?
what __name1__ @/@ __name2__ do n't seem to understand is that the bigger a movement gets , the more trouble @-@ makers it is going to attract .
in other words , the trouble @-@ makers at the __name1__ protests do not represent the movement itself .
the __name1__ from the very beginning had a message of peaceful protesting .
that is what the founders of the movement intended .
unfortunately , because the movement is leaderless and has become so wide @-@ spread , some of them have gotten chaotic .
that is a human @-@ driven consequence ; it is not because of the ideology .
i think it is reasonable to criticize the __name1__ movement as lacking clear goals and leadership .
if it did have these qualities , i think more people would take their message more seriously .
however , by that same rationale , it is unfair to criticize the movement itself for a few of the trouble @-@ makers .
let me put it this way : if the __name2__ had become as popular movement as the ows has ( not even close ) , would the movement have attracted the same kind of law @-@ breakers we see at these __name1__ protests ?
the answer is absolutely .
the __name1__ elected representatives , have a congressional caucus and impacted the legislative process so much it prevented the dem agenda
ows has only broken laws
stop making sense .
the right @-@ wing neocon whackjobs on this board only care about the small percentage that seemingly cause trouble .
they love __name1__ st 's unfettered love of greed and capitalism .
accountability is something that happens in a cpa 's office , not on wall st. do n't you know that __name1__ is responsible for creating all those jobs out there .
even when they create nothing , but just take massive fees for doing nothing , or , in the case of some ceo 's get their ' rightful ' hands on those multi @-@ __quant1__ dollar bonuses even if the stock tanks and the company makes a loss .
you know why ?
because most of them are like __name1__ - only in the sense they should have the moniker teflon in front of their names - because nothing is ever their fault and nothing ever sticks .
stock tanked ?
" not my fault that the economy 's going under .
didnt ' see that coming .
you want me to involve my lawyers if you do n't pay me my bonus ?
think of the bad publicity .
not my fault "
that 's how they think .
and the biggest irony here is , that all these neocon loons on this board that support them harp on about personal responsibility all the time - except when it comes to __name1__ apparently .
' cause it seems that because they create " all these jobs ", they are somehow entitled to a free pass .
and yet , polls show that most __name1__ do not support __name2__ ideas .
in fact , more people support the message of the __name2__ movement than they do the message of the __name1__ .
what upsets most __name2__ about the __name1__ movement is the crime and over @-@ night occupation .
the __name1__ message itself , however , is something they support .
you are doing exactly what you criticize others for .
you do n't want __name1__ labeled for the actions of the few ....
and yet that is exactly what you do .
hypocrisy is funny though .
what message is that ?
really ?
who have i criticised ?
that we have a financial system that favors the wealthy .
yes we do
that is the message ?
every financial system in history favors the one with the finances
a financial system that favors the poor = charity
you are a few days late and a few dollars short .
a few __name1__ people had some signs at their rallies · that some did n't care for.so what happened ?
the whole __name1__ · was branded as racist and according to __name2__ , all white .
you are gonna have to live with it my friend .
how bout that guy they let out of jail that threatened to · burn down nyc and firebomb __name1__ 's...
have n't seen any __name1__ peeps denounce this guy .
the odoriferous wasteoid slacker movement is nothing but a nuiscence ....
to claim it has any credibility with anyone other than marxists and other assorted crazies is fucking delusional .
it is n't even covered by news outlets for the most part .
lol , you all sure did n't have any trouble labeling the whole __name1__ for a few..
do n't like it when it when the shoe is on the other foot eh ?
only thing , i havn't seen anything nobel about the __name1__ ...
rambling bunch of idiots in my book .
not only that , they consistently lied about the __name1__ when they could n't find enough whack jobs to make them look bad enough .
so i am sure you all heard of his speech in which he said if __name1__ did n't pass his bill murder and rapes would go up .
in that speech he claimed the murder rate in __name1__ __name2__ had more than doubled already .
false it is down __value1__ % .
he pointed out that __name1__ had , had to lay off some cops , which is true , but he left out the most important fact .
__name1__ was in negotiations with the police union , they wanted them to take a small cut in their benefit program in order to avoid any lay offs .
as unions usually do , they chose keeping their benefits at the level they are , over keeping cops on the job , and the lay offs happened .
however despite the layoffs murder and rape are still down __value1__ % in __name1__ .
is this to be sop for the __name1__ party for now on ?
propose a whole shit load of spending , then claim opposition to that new spending is " cutting jobs " and causing people to be raped and murdered ?
__name1__ should be ashamed of this administration and their hyper partisan , dishonest , fear mongering .
less cops - more murder and rapes .
why is that so hard to understand ?
rapists across the country are tuning in to __name2__ @- just hoping that the __name1__ jobs bills does n't pass .....
could be .
could be .
except in __name1__ , where they went down ...
what 's so hard to understand ?
the feculant flea baggers that are shitting on __name1__ are responsible for more crime as well .....
__name1__ wall street to blame for increased gun violence in nyc ? </a>
<a __name1__ business times </a>
a bad economy and fewer jobs will almost certainly cause more crime and strife .
__name1__ poop .
link ?
and yet violent crime is down substantially right now in the middle of a bad economy .
go figure .
why did __name1__ try to panic __name2__ by saying that rape statistics would rise if __name3__ 's jobs bill was n't passed ?
is he a fool who is n't aware that violent rape incidents are going down or is he a lying bastard who does n't give a damn ?
he is a __name1__ desperate for __quant1__ more years .
__name1__ lied through his teeth and claimed rape was up __value1__ % in __name2__ when it 's down __value2__ %
__name1__ laid off police officers because the union refused to accept any cuts and chose their benefits over avoiding layoffs .
would n't feculant flea beggers be a better description ?
think it 's going to stay that way with less police ?
heck..
maybe there are less police to report crimes to so people are like , why bother ?
and why should cops have to accept less benefits ?
so they can cut taxes for overpaid rich folks ?
in a word , yes .
greed is bribing corrupt politicians for favorable tax treatment .
ask __name1__ :
"' through the tax code , there has been class warfare waged , and my class has won , ' __name1__ said .
it ’s been a rout .
you have seen a period where __name1__ workers generally have gone no place , and where the really super rich as a group increased their incomes __value1__ for __quant1__ in this rarified atmosphere .
<a href="http://prospect.org/article/why-we-need-occupy-wall-street?utm_source=daily+digest&utm_campaign=39ed4689d6-dd_11_16_1111_16_2011&utm_medium=email"> why __name1__ wall street </a>
great , so __name1__ bribing corrupt politicians is bad , right ?
__name1__ membership in the overall workforce has declined from about __value1__ % in the __decade1__ s to around __value2__ % today .
during that same half @-@ century , the __value1__ % has tripled their share of income and wealth .
it seems like the __value1__ % are getting a lot more benefit from their corruption dollars than __name1__ are ; prosecuting corruption in __name2__ and on __name3__ is n't likely to happen by " choosing " between __name4__ or __name5__ in the voting booth .
yup the " rich " get richer .
the solution is not to make the rich poorer , but to make more people rich .
government can n't do that .
only getting an education , having a good idea and working your ass off can make you rich .
__name1__ do n't hate poor people .
we hate that there are poor people .
paying people to stay poor only makes more poor people and less rich ones .
i share your pov , geroge , but i think you 're more hopeful than i am .
i 've kinda seen these popular protests come and go , ya know ?
i mean , compared to the antiwar and civil rights movements __name1__ seems like ( at least so far ) small potatoes .
but the fact that the __name1__ movement has changed the nature __name2__ the grand national argument __name2__ are having ?
now that has been it 's major success to date .
and that is a good thing , in my opinion .
do you remember reading what __name1__ has had to say about the early days of the protests against the __name2__ ?
as i recall , he 's said the number of spectators outnumbered the marchers , and the police spent their time protecting the protestors from spectators .
__name1__ has projected a timeline for success that 's roughly equal to the amount __name2__ time between the signing __name2__ the __name2__ and the ratification of the __name3__ .
__name1__ will have to become ony .
imho , they will have to bring hundreds of thousands of unemployed and underemployed onto __name1__ , possibly on week @-@ ends , in order to maximize crowd size .
a few years ago , i saw __quant1__ hand the effect that half @-@ a @-@ million protestors in the streets around __name1__ had on local government .
that was during the height of " immigration reform " when __name1__ language radio was instrumental in convincing __name2__ to get involved on their day off .
if __name1__ can do the same thing in __name2__ around next __month1__ ... ?
any millionaire who wants to pay higher taxes can just stop taking deductions .
easy , or they can write a check .
solution found .
i do n't know where you were during the immigration reform grand march .
i was here .
it accomplished nothing except to deprive mexicans of a day 's income .
it was so harmful that they never did it again .
is n't that a clue ?
there were plenty of stores open with the __name1__ ones closed .
schools reported less fighting , freeway traffic was a breeze , stores reported less shoplifting , hospital emergency rooms could treat truly sick and injured people .
meanwhile , the changes that they wanted , never happened .
there is no universal amnesty , they still do n't have driver 's licenses .
they got nothing .
the goal was to shut the city down .
all they did was shut themselves down .
so hard , that it was the __value1__ and last time they did it .
although i wish they would do it again .
it was so nice .
__quant1__ day of experiencing what it would be like without the inconvenience and annoyance .
schools reported less fighting on a saturday ?
in fact " they " did it again the following __name2__ with a march along __name1__ blvd . · where you there ?
do you have any clues about how to organize marches of that size in support of __name1__ ?
any " inconvenience and annoyance " experienced by local bigots was a small price to pay for sending the 1 % the message that immigrants won't be scapegoats this time .
the __name1__ movement rails about " greed ", like we can outlaw an emotion .
but what is greed ?
is someone who works hard because he wants to get ahead greedy ?
i do n't think anyone would say so .
it seems greed is wanting money that legitimately does n't belong to you .
i can be as greedy as i want , but unless someone gives me money voluntarily then it does n't do much .
if i deceive someone , then i am a criminal .
but if i deliver on what i 've promised then i 've earned my money .
by that definition the __name1__ crowd are the greedy ones .
they demand their student loans get paid off , yet they 've done nothing to deserve that .
they demand--well , i dont know what they want .
neither do they .
but demanding someone else 's money is greed .
greed is __name1__ destroying the world economy with a $ __quant1__ dollar derivatives __name2__ scheme .
greed is __quant1__ of the __quant2__ deadly sins of the __name1__ :
__year1__ painting the worship of mammon by __name1__ morgan.greed ( __name2__ , avaritia ) , also known as avarice or covetousness , is , like lust and gluttony , a sin of excess .
however , greed ( as seen by the church ) is applied to a very excessive or rapacious desire and pursuit of wealth , status , and power .
__name1__ wrote that greed was " a sin against __name2__ , just as all mortal sins , in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things ."
in __name2__ 's __name1__ , the penitents were bound and laid face down on the ground for having concentrated too much on earthly thoughts .
" avarice " is more of a blanket term that can describe many other examples of greedy behavior .
these include disloyalty , deliberate betrayal , or treason , [ citation needed ] especially for personal gain , for example through bribery .
scavenging[citation needed ] and hoarding of materials or objects , theft and robbery , especially by means of violence , trickery , or manipulation of authority are all actions that may be inspired by greed .
such misdeeds can include simony , where one profits from soliciting goods within the actual confines of a church .
__quant1__ href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/seven_deadly_sins"> seven deadly __name1__ - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia </a>
if we want to stamp out lust we can start with __name1__ .
but this is n't about the __quant1__ deadlies .
it is about the definitin of greed .
how do you separate greed from ambition ?
greed can mean an excessive desire for getting or having something , especially money , but greed is not always a bad thing .
greedy people can be , by virtue of their own ambitions , very benevolent and are often charitable people who also employ many others and sign their paychecks .
there will always be greed , however one defines that , and there will always be people who benefit from greedy people .
greed can be a very good thing .
it can mean jobs .
what you are describing is ambition , not greed .
i maintain greed is wanting what does n't belong to you rightfully .
by that definition the __name1__ people are greedy .
your vision will likely not change things .
many people think poverty is a virtue .
it may or may not be , but expecting someone else to work to support you does n't seem particularly virtuous to me .
so ...
i take it , you do n't have kids ?
even my own kids it is n't an open @-@ ended support forever .
at some point they need to responsible for their own lives .
what is " greed "?
it 's stockholders ....

" a new study by __name1__ concludes that institutional investors no longer accept the fact that chief executives may get involved in policy debates .
they demand it .
in fact , more than __value1__ percent of the investors surveyed said they want ceos to engage more with policy makers to protect their company ’ s interests .
with __value1__ percent of those surveyed also complaining that the decisions coming out of __name1__ have been negative for their portfolios , it ’s easy to see why . and when the survey pool consists of __quant1__ investors managing assets of $ __quant2__ , executives may want to heed that advice ."
what is " greed "?
my current definition is hedge funds and energy speculators manipuating the oil markets when they have zero business being there in the __value1__ st place .
they add no value and are destructive to the extreme of causing food riots in __value1__ rd world countries .
lech 's are they all .
according to the liberal lexicon , " greed " is the condition of anyone who 's got what you want and can n't get .
the answer then , is to become rich !
anyone can do it .
if a couple of kids fidding in the garage can create __name1__ or __name2__ , it can be done .
not by the lazy , but it can be done .
the battle cry of the left is gimmmeeeee .
why is __name1__ calling for higher taxes on the __value1__ % ?
__name1__ already made his money .
raising taxes on high incomes won't hurt him that much .
income taxes prevent people from becoming rich , not from being rich .
greed is defined by __name1__ and __name2__ bankers hijacking our financial system , and gangster politicians like the __name4__ 's __name3__ hijacking __name5__
cisco ?
that you ? ???
how are things out on the fork ?
still trying to get your __quant1__ minutes of fame ?
still think ' fair tax ' is going to fly ?
like you a lot , but is that a comb over ? ??
greedy is as greedy does .
if you truly do n't know what greed means than nobody is going to be able to explain it to you .
gee .....
how profound , goober .

greed is the ethics code of all the ex @-@ __name1__ executives now employed by the __name2__ administration .
greed is the ability to rationalize gaining wealth by spreading poverty .
in other words , it 's the credo of the __name1__ party .
__name1__ has captured the attention and participation of the entire world .
this is indisputible .
they have a lot of very legitimate concerns but · __name1__ , the rw e @-@ media etc...
have enslaved the minds of conservatives , · much in the way of the book " __name1__ ".
do not pay attention to the evidence !
we will tell you what to think .
we will tell you your opinions .
this has been evidenced in other threads .
so when an occupier says " we object to the level of influence afforded · corporations and special interest groups by __name1__ ! "
a conservative will reply as they have been instructed with something · like " you poop on streets ! "
notice how the issue is avoided and the need for independent thought · is eliminated ?
conservatives are simply not equipped to deal with the · issues that __name1__ has brought up , so they parrot what they have been · taught .
the issues ?
* we do n't want to end captialism , we want to end the corporatacracy · and restore our democratic republic .
for every hour a senator or · congressman spends with a citizen who has a legitimate concern , they · spend over __quant1__ with a lobbyist , ceo or union leader ( oh damn , that · eliminates the " change the subject tactic that conservatives use when · they can n't address issues directly ! ) .
there is no voice of the people .
anyone thinking our government is not run by money , is a fool .
* no more bank bailouts .
this includes __name1__ and __name2__ , btw · ( oh damn , that eliminates the " change the subject tactic that · conservatives use when they can n't address issues directly ! ) .
* stop giving money belonging to we the people , away to the corrupt · politicians of foreign governments .
* no more subsidies or tax breaks to any company that does n't hire · __value1__ % american , attribute their income 100 % in __name1__ and pay their · taxes 100 % in __name1__ .
* reverse " __name1__ " and put elections back in the hands of · the people .
* repeal __name1__ @-@ __name1__ @-@ __name1__ ( like __name2__ says ! ) .
those are just some of the issues .
how will conservatives respond to · the issues ?
we all know .
dodge , change the subject , project what they · have been instructed to believe etc...
well · guess what conservs .
the __name1__ did n't promote ending the intereference of · religion in politics .
they 're overwhelingly old and conservative .

you lying asswarp of a cow .

who 's got a better one ?
i would like to thank you for proving my point .
corporatism ?
gramm @-@ leach @-@ blilely ?
nope .
just as your thoughtmasters told you to do !
thanks !
you and others like you have proven beyond all doubt that it is a waste of time to reply to liberal rants .
the liberals are running ( and ruining ) this country .
liberalism is a fucking mental disorder !
well played !
how obedient the lemmings are !
yeah ....
right .
the left just wants the gov't .
to tell you what to do .
funny how the left hates the truth .
i would like to thank you for being a complete moron and showing everyone what the left is really all about .
if we could only learn from our mistakes !
let 's review : · __year1__ a federal budget surplus .
then tax cuts for the rich , __quant1__ wars fought on credit borrowed from the __name1__ .
then deregulation of the banking system and __name1__ .
gee .
i wonder which policies really screwed the pooch ?
maybe we should run right back to the conservative policies that squandered the surplus , reduced revenues by cutting taxes for those who are most comfortable and borrow from our economic competition to pay for wars we should never have fought in the first place .
or we could poke sharp sticks in our eyes .
either way makes as much sense as the other .
my thoughtmasters are telling me to call you a fuckin ' idiot .
sorry , they made me do it .
more left wing bull crap .
there was no surplus , __name1__ played with the numbers and __name2__ balanced the budget .
you would n't know the truth if it mattered to you .
your grandchildren must be very proud of your filthy mouth .
i 'm pissed off at your fucking __name1__ giving __quant1__ $$$$$ to a __value1__ % bastard like __name2__ to bail out his " green " company .
now if you want to start " occupy the __name1__ elites who perform financial fellatio on __quant1__ basis with rich donors ", i could get behind that .
there was no surplus .
i assume you are referring to the imaginary surplus created by the voodoo economics of the __name1__ administration .
try again .
the rest of your post is opinion .
i remember during the campaigns of __year1__ they , the press , was calling the recession at that time the " __name1__ recession ".
how many times are you going to post the same tripe pretending like it 's factual ?
you purport to know what __name1__ is all about .
guess what , there is no concise belief system of __name1__ .
there are so many divergent point of views , there is no way to actually begin to discuss the ' movement ' in an intelligent , logical manner .
you can re @-@ post all the points of legitimate contention over and over .
however , when the vast majority of the movement has been an uncivilized assault on the rest of society peppered with vapid chants , you 're not going to convince anyone that it has any more substance than a teenager 's temper tantrum .
crony capitalism has been on the fore front of political debate for at least a few years now .
and it got there without any of the vitriol of the __name1__ .
at this point in time , the __name1__ has not only changed absolutely nothing or put forward any new objections or ideas , they have actually made a mockery of some very legitimate greivances .
more often than not __name1__ protestors are targeting their peers on the street rather than anyone who has committed any actual wrong doing .
you call that an intelligent movement ?
castigating working people for trying to make a living ?
that 's not only misdirected , it 's compelely stupid and counter productive .
and you wonder why no one takes anything about the so called movement seriously ?
by all means , wake up .
now here 's a decent post worth reading .
while the owsers are entitled to make their point about income inequality and greed , the manner in which they 're doing it does not serve the cause very well .
well unlike the ignorant azzhole with the __name1__ avatar , you at least make some points - even though you do exactly what the op says - which is ignore all the points that the __value1__ nd phase of __name2__ is forwarding .
so here is the difference between us : i can acknowledge your points .
yes , there are a lot of in __name1__ we would all rather not have there .
but as far as making grievances in the way that you feel it should be done ?
well what 's that gotten you ?
cronyism disappear from politics , did it ?
less influence of corporations , sigs and unions on elections ?
how about that citizen 's __name1__ decision , eh !
oh yeah , that helped .
now i never lived in a tent but i 'm glad these people did .
they started a wake up call .
it has evolved way beyond the tents now .
oh , and i started another thread that simply let people know that what they were seeing on the __name1__ about __name2__ , was no more comprehensive that what was shown about the __name3__ at first .
offered some of the issues .
what were the replies from conservs ?
not one said " well let 's discuss this issue about...."
just a bunch of parrots repeating what the __name1__ has fed them .
like __name1__ ...
this thing has just grown thousands of times bigger and gotten a lot more attention .
growing pains of an movement that is still in it 's embryonic phases .
we are not going away .
but they won't address the issues .
the thoughtmasters have told them · not to ...
and the __name1__ has been doing this for __quant1__ and __quant1__ .
the right has __quant1__ , count them __quant1__ media outlet and the f'ing 10+ left wing media masters can n't stand it .
you do realize this has been going on for __quant1__ and __quant1__ on your ( cough , cough ) news sites .
they lost all journalistic integrity by filling everyone with lies and left wing bs and you have the nerve to b*tch about the __quant1__ right leaning cable news network .

okay , point made .
conservatives are scared little cowards when it comes to issues .
they 're scared sh1 tless !
__quant1__ post , not one has the balls to discuss a single issue .
their thoughtmasters have forbidden it !
so the mindless drones just parrot what they are told to think .
what a bunch a weak little pusses .
you lack both independence and logic .
and you wonder why people do n't address the ' issues ' you raise .
issues are based on at least some vague reality - left wing whining does not count as reality .
__value1__ ?
id 10 t
anyone who 's stupid enough to believe that the status quo ante __name2__ was that the electoral power resided in the *people 's* hands is stupid enough to believe that __name1__ has accomplished something beyond __quant1__ minutes of fame .
lol !
another one , cali ?
okay sweetie , you 're absolutely right !
there is no such thing as __name1__ @-@ __name1__ @-@ __name1__ , bailouts or the __name2__ .
now go play and we grown ups will talk about what of course , would n't be reality to a child .
__name1__ signed the statement of principles in __month1__ , __year1__ along with other rw neo @-@ conservatives who lead us into the __name2__ war , economic chaos and the death and injury of thousands of __name3__ .
anyone who supports __name1__ or any neo @-@ conservative is a fool !
see : <a href="http://www.newamericancentury.org/statementofprinciples.htm"> statement of principles </a>
from your link :
our aim is to remind __name1__ of these lessons and to draw their consequences for today .
here are __quant1__ consequences : • we need to increase defense spending significantly if we are to carry out our global · responsibilities today and modernize our armed forces for the future ;
• we need to strengthen our ties to democratic allies and to challenge regimes hostile to our interests and values ;
• we need to promote the cause of political and economic freedom abroad ;
• we need to accept responsibility for __name1__ 's unique role in preserving and extending an international order friendly to our security , our prosperity , and our principles .
i see absolutely nothing wrong with those goals .
i take it that you would suggest quite the opposite ?
that 's coming along just fucking splendidly so far ...
i would like to see __name1__ back in elected office .
he is a voice of reason within the __name1__
would n't __name1__ and __name2__ make an awsome ticket in __year1__ ?
the president and vice @-@ president can n't be from the same state .
49 @-@ 44 does not indicate a strong challenge .
if an incumbent is polling behind the challenger then it 's a strong challenge .
however , as with every other poll threads have been started about regarding __year1__ , this one is just as irrelevant .
the election is __quant1__ years away so it does n't matter what the poll says today .
really ?
__value1__ st __value1__ heard that one .
care to link that one ?
here
i 'll help :
according to __value1__ , " a . the __name1__ does n't say that they cannot be from the same state .
however , the 12 th __name1__ does say that electors may not vote for a president from their state and a vice president also from their state .
this issue came up in the <a __year1__ 2000 presidential campaign </a> __name2__ texas __name1__ bush chose __name2__ texas __name3__ cheney to be his running mate .
__name1__ , who had served in __name2__ as a representative from wyoming , quickly changed his legal residence back to __name3__ to avoid the possible conflict for electors from __name4__ .
court challenges to __name1__ 's change of residency were denied .
it is unlikely that __quant1__ people from the same state would ever be nominated by a major political party .
it is constitutionally possible however .
if it ever came to pass , the party that won the ticket 's state would likely suggest to the electors that their votes for the president go to the presidential nominee and that the votes for the vice president be given in honor of a party official .
electors in all other states , as mentioned above , would be free to vote for both of the party 's nominees .
__value1__ href="http://wiki.answers.com/q/can_the_vice_president_and_president_come_from_the_same_state"> answers.com - can the vice president and president come from the same state </a>
cant happen · you can not have both members of a ticket from the same state
here
__value1__ is a poor source · at least for a definitive answer
i do n't know if he wants to be a senator .
they tried to draft him in the last race but he turned them down .
__name2__ 's a weak candidate but if the __name1__ nominates someone weak as well - like they did with that kathy chick with all the make @-@ up who was responsible for the vote count in __year1__ - then nelson will win .
__name1__ is done with politics , i predict .
he 's making too much money , cashing in from his governorship .
__name1__ has always been more about money than politics .
he 's more like his brother neil than his father .
plus , who the hell in his right mind would ever vote for another bush ?
of course , if he did run , the right @-@ tards here would fawn all over him , swearing that this __name1__ is a conservative .
no ...
really ...
he 's a conservative ...
not like his brother ...
this time it 's for real ...
not like his father ...
nope ...
he 's the real deal ! !!
__name1__ asked former <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/united_states_secretary_of_defense"> secretary of defense </a> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/dick_cheney"> dick cheney </a> to head up a team to help select a running mate for him , but ultimately , bush __name2__ that cheney should be the vice presidential nominee .
while the __name2__ __name1__ does not specifically disallow a president and a vice president from the same state , it ' does ' prohibit electors from casting both of his or her votes for persons from his or her own state .
accordingly , cheney—who had been a resident of <a __name1__ texas </a> for __quant1__ 10 years—changed his voting registration back __name2__ wyoming .
had __name3__ not done this , either he or __name1__ would have forfeited their electoral votes from the __name2__ electors .
i know its wiki , but that is a better source
__name1__ united states presidential __year1__ , __name2__ - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia </a>
actually , based on his actions as governor , __name1__ is far more conservative than his brother or his dad
here
all it 's saying is that voters from that particular vote can ; t vote for *both*.
so the vp would n't carry that state .
__quant1__ other states to choose from .
all i can really say is either accept that source or provide a better , more " definitive ", one
like i said ...
i voted for __name1__ when i lived there · you know nothing about him , fuck off
god , why could n't that jap gunner in __name1__ have aimed a little better and prevented this from ever happening ?
not funny .
not appropriate .
__name1__ is a great __name2__ hero , with his actions and bravery in __name3__ .
and he was a pretty damn good president , too , especially compared to the guy right before him .
__name1__ 's horrible policies started to come home to roost under __name2__ 's term .
he 's a victim of prior incompetence in the same way __name1__ is , only to a much , much , much , much lesser degree .
oh no , not neg rep , what will i ever do ?
while your hero __name3__ was busy being a lousy pilot and getting rescued by a submarine , __name1__ was busy channelling money to __name2__ .
just imagine , only a few more inches and no s&l scandal , no rigged election , no __name1__ , the possibilities are endless .
you make this sound like a bad thing .
holy shit
i 'm feeling better about the stupid shit i posted , earlier today , more and more by the minute
__name1__ almost seems a shoe in , he 's already beating __name2__ in a hypothetical match up .
by christina bellantoni · __name1__ staff · __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ , 5 @:@ __time1__ p.m .
former __name1__ gov. __name3__ is the strong favorite among __name2__ voters to challenge sen. __name4__ ( d ) in __year1__ , a new public policy polling survey shows .

among the more likely candidates
__name2__ __name1__ florida __name3__ jeb bush __name4__ challenge __name5__ roll call </a>
i take it back , you 're the typical , played out , lib drone .
those goals=
^^case and fuckin point^^
i have n't neg repped you .
__name1__ would make a great senator .
he has experience and clout within his party .
he would offer a sane voice and moderation within the party
too bad he can n't run for president
ditto .
its way to bad he won't run for president .
__name1__ would have to cheat to win a national election .
the __name1__ cant cheat that much anymore because the electronic machines are being watched more closely now .
it 's a __name1__ race
__name2__ replacing __name1__ would be too awesome ! !!!
__name1__ @/@ __name2__ ticket in __year1__ ?
let 's see how __name1__ 's replacement works out __value1__ !
not as big a fool as a spammer trying to sell shit in their sig
__name1__ signed the in __month1__ , __year1__ along with other rw neo @-@ conservatives who lead us into the __name2__ , economic chaos and the death and injury of thousands of __name3__ .
lol .
__name1__ was 14 in __year1__ .
i reckon you meant 97 · hey , for uh merkin __quant1__ outa __quant2__ aint bad at all !
jeb=a __name1__ with a smattering of intelligence .
tell us about your great achievements in life ?
sitting in your cramped room all day picking your nose does n't count .
and , what might your great accomplishments in life be ?
and , do n't tell us you 're dating __name1__ .
just because your inflatable doll is black does n't make it so .
wow ! !!
that sounds really familiar .
where have i heard that before ? ??
oh ! !
yea .
i remember ! !
it seems you copy @/@ paste too well .
you got the date wrong , too .
a new world recored for epic fail ! !
your very __value1__ post .
wry is stereo typical .
he can n't see the harm his side causes and denies the good the other side does .
he 's a lot like tm , they can be proven wrong by using thier own links against them .
makes you wonder where they get thier talking points form .
must a mass email from the __name1__ .
i wonder if __name3__ would bow before the the __name4__ monarch , hold his hand , and walk on grass so that the filthy __name1__ dictator could use the concrete sidewalk like your tyrannical hero __name2__ did ?
of course he would .
the bushes have been in bed with the __name1__ for __quant1__ .
why do you think __name1__ let all the __name2__ get out of the country on chartered jets so fast after __name3__ @/@ __name3__ ?
he 's as good as .
maybe even better because he knows how to run a big state .
__name1__ did well while he was gov.
and __name1__ 's executive experience would come in handy as a senator ...
how ?
ya got it scrambled : · his __name1__ experience will compliment his executive experience for the next rung on the ladder .
hell , __name1__ just elected a junior senator with zero executive experince .
just think how better qualified __name1__ would be ! !
__name1__ won't vote for another __name2__ for president .
and they sure as hell won't vote for an obiewanknownothing
speak __name1__ !
obie @-@ wan @-@ know @-@ nothing
betters ?
this speculation is a great way to waste time on a forum , but in reality it makes zero sense .
consider :
if you are not already rich , becoming senator can @/@ will lead to riches , but the __name1__ is a stepping stone to the presidency if you are a very , very rich person with political ambition .
__name1__ is no dummy .
he knows that __name1__ won't elect another __name2__ as president .
so why would he ever want to deal with any of that nonsense , moving to __name1__ from __name2__ , dealing with the little people voters , taking a massive pay cut ...
for what ? !?
my logic is unassailable on this one , folks .
(( my logic is unassailable on this one , folks ....
to bad it did n't show up..
it 's usually governors that end up presidents..
i do n't believe most __name1__ are that familiar with __name2__ and i do n't see why a run for the presidency is so far out of the question ...
__name1__ or __name2__ ...
i 'd be going __name1__ ...
who would n't ?
not another bush , please ...
not me i done with the bushs
it 's important to note that buffet has significant investments in life insurance companies .
the life insurance lobby is one of the strongest supporters of the estate tax .
one way to get around the estate tax is to buy very expensive life insurance coverage .
__name1__ and __name2__ also support the estate tax , are you gonna tell me that they have a vested interest in life insurance too ?
<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/technology/2003-01-12-gates_x.htm"> __name1__ gates sr. supports estate tax </a>
__name1__ __value1__ __name2__ fighting __name3__ , __name4__ __value1__ on tax - steven bertoni - money __name5__ - forbes </a>
until you people look at the loopholes for gate 's and buffet 's estates , i certainly would n't be using them as stellar examples to prove your points .
the relatives will be well taken care of through the trusts .
not much will be able to be taxed , because of the charities within the trusts .
i have to laugh at some of you for even bringing these fine examples of capitalism to the forefront .
actually your an idiot .
most of buffetts and __name1__ estates are actually being donated to charity .
buffets business will be taken over by his children .
but they will only be assuming leadership , since the majority of buffetts wealth is in his shares of __name2__ , it will be transfered to the __name1__ and __name1__ over the next few years in the form of stock .
which will then be sold on the open market and the proceeds will benefit the charity .
__name1__ wants his children to earn their own money like he did , not get it free .
nice try with him simply giving his money to his heirs tax free .
you have to look a little closer than that .
no , i 'm not an idiot ....
the keyword is charities , and who are on the boards of those charities .
but , keep trying ....
yep all income should be taxed exactly the same no matter how you got it .
even if it 's already been taxed once ?
tell me , do you pay taxes at the grocery store on the food you buy and then pay taxes again when you eat it ?
how many bites of the apple does the gubmint get ?
the answer is ....
no.
you do n't pay again for it when you eat it .
but i 'm sure if they could figure out a way they would try to tax what we put in our mouths when we put it in our mouths and then again when it comes out of our asses .
not everyone is as rich or as selfish towards his kids as __name1__ is .
it 's funny all those on here that do n't have a problem with the " estate tax " do n't have a dog in the fight .
i 'd wager most are on the govt .
dole in some fashion .
as for me __quant1__ have worked for many __quant1__ for the wealth __quant1__ 've aquired and my children should reap all the benefits , after all they 're the reason __quant1__ worked my ass off all these years .
and for this they should be made to pay taxes on money that has already been taxed ?
it 's time we get every single liberal puke out of __name1__ and make government , the government our forefathers invisioned , which is to insure domestic tranquility , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and future generations .
you are n't going to be subject to an estate tax .
and if you were , i 'd question your values in the claim that your little angels need more than $ __quant1__ + __value1__ % of the wealth in excess of that .
how are they ever going to learn the value of hard work just like you did ?
when you buy groceries with your paycheck , that money has been taxed .
when the grocery store profits from your purchase , they get taxed .
when the grocer buys new furniture with his taxed earnings , the furniture store gets taxed on their profits .
so yes , money gets taxed , generally , every time it changes hands .
i do n't know why that 's so difficult to grasp .
damn you 're stupid .
translated : " fuck he 's right ...
what do i do ...
ok let 's just call him stupid ."
oh boo hoo hoo !
i 'll only get to start out with a sum only equivalant to __quant1__ years the median average pretaxed incomes of the __name1__ family .
that 's not fair !
wah !
wah wah !
what right does the government have to something it had already taxed and taken their ( incorrect ) ' fair share '?
you 're right .
it is not fair to double tax .
i 'm not ?
can i get a written guarantee on that ?
the values my children do or do not learn is of no concern to you .
oh and you 're not me .
no you 're not right , you say every time money changes hands it gets taxed , but you fail to recognize that money earned and that has been taxed will be taxed a __value1__ time upon death per the estate tax .
your comparing money that has been earned , taxed , spent thus being earned by another party , taxed and spent again etc etc...
not the same as the estate tax at all .
you fail !
should n't __name1__ be wrapping his mouth around something else ?
other people 's money should not be his concern - look what his pet housing project for the poor and downtrodden has resulted in for everybody .
and that is the debate being had .
the __value1__ % on amounts over $ 5m is the compromise , and frankly , it 's a compromise that 's slanted incredibly far to the right .
but it just ain't good enough is it ?
no no , we need *no* estate tax at all .
tough shit .
we live in a society where everyone gets a voice , and this is the current policy .
chances are it will move more to the middle over time .
and stop worrying about it ...
nobody believes you 're worth $ 5m so give it up , man !
tell ya what ; pm me .
when you die , if there 's an estate tax , have your kids send me the bill and i 'll take care of it .
your kids won't lose __quant1__ cent to inheritance taxes , __quant1__ 'll wager .
and if your kids cannot make it with __quant1__ years worth of the pretexed median salaries of their fellow __name1__ families combined , then honestly ...
are they even suited to having that much money to begin with ?
if a scion cannot make it with $ __quant1__ tax free dollars , then honestly what good does it do them ( but more importantly the rest of us ) to have still more money ?
the estate tax in my state starts at a __quant1__ .
take your tired rethoric and lust for others wealth some where else .
i hear __name1__ is looking for a few good __name2__ .
you would be a shoe in
vote with your feet then , dood .
move to __name1__ .
they have no estate tax .
__name1__ will force a vote by firearm .
i am sticking around for that .
with me its a passion .
what state do you live in ?
one of __quant1__ or one of __quant2__ if you listen to the __name1__
earned wealth is neither liberal nor conservative .
it is the property of someone .
inheritance has already been taxed .
all inheritance should be tax free .
transfer of wealth from a family that had earned it to one that has not is a way to fund government that spends too much $$.
if government would spend as much time looking for ways to slow the growth and cut spending of government as it does looking for ways to rob citizens at the point of a gun the budget would not be a problem .
but most conservatives are also liberals when it comes to cutting their " entitlement " program .
hell no is their answer then .
you do pay income tax on your paycheck and the sales tax on consumable goods ?
what isnt that double taxation ?
damn did i just through a wrench in your argument about the same money being taxed twice ?
and food is actually not taxable .
your right , we are being double and sometimes triple dipped .
you actually want it to continue and get quadruple and quintuple dipped ?
how about our pay checks just go to the gubmint and they give everyone an equal share to meet their needs ?
by the way , if food is n't taxable .......
why do i pay taxes on it at the grocery store ?
depends where you live .
medicine is also taxable here .
gubmint needs their cut of my pie after all .
you know , you 're right .
everyone in our society gets a voice .
what they should n't get , is access to my checkbook by government force .
fuck them !
go earn your own damn living .
i agree , we need no estate tax at all .
btw i do n't care what you or anyone else believes .
if what __name1__ says is true , that what you inherit is n't worked for thus should be taxed at __value1__ % , what does that say about what the government gets in taxes from us ?
the government did n't work for it .
why do they feel they have a right to all of that money ?
this assumes that what we did n't actually work for automatically belongs to the government .
this is why __name1__ 's argument is wrong .
you should n't be taxed higher just because , in his opinion , you did n't work for it .
as long as it 's legal it does n't matter how you got it .
what right does he have to decide the level of taxation according to how it was obtained ?
watch the video :
__name1__ barney frank and his hypocrisy </a>
the __value1__ goal of __name1__ is the removal of private property .
the ownership of all property by the government .
i think we 're seeing this in __name1__ .
' heirs did n’t do anything to deserve inheritance '....
jackass ....
this guy needed to go , so bad .
[ quote=common sense ; 3117559 ]
what exactly did heirs do to earn this $ other than being born into that family ?
this isnt a monarchy and never has been .
heirs didnt work a day in their life to earn anything , so why should they be able to get everything for free ?
and the constitution gives the government to right to collect taxes ...
or did you forget about that little clause ...
if you did its article 1 , section 8 as well as the 16 th __name1__ .
__value1__ off , a ) you know this how ?
how many have inheritable @/@ inherited wealth they had no hand in helping create or maintain ?
i 'll wait while you get back to me with those figures ....
b ) who do you think you are ?
so you do n't think someone deserves ?
oh thank you commissar ...
deserves ? ?
really ?
okay ....
__quant2__ do n't think you deserve internet access __quant1__ __quant2__ day .
hows that ?
what did you do to make that happen ?
c ) your envy , no jealousy , is noted .
well internet access is a pay service so you can try to limit my usage , but it wont work .
now if an heir to a business actually works at the business , then it can be passed on to them without much tax consequence .
all you need to do is hire a lawyer and go through the proper channels and paperwork .
so you 'll now create a gov. agency who will vet inheritances and of they think the son has worked hard enough hes okay to forgo the tax ?
you 're pulling my leg , right ?
because thats not the way it works , its taxed as an asset and due in cash within __quant1__ year .
but many heirs did not actually do anything to deserve the $ other than being born .
lets look at the __name2__ sisters .
no jobs at the hotel , no college education , nothing but being born a __name1__ .
do they deserve have the family business ?
what about actors children ?
or politicans children ?
or musicians children ?
they obviously had no hand in creating the family wealth , yet the benefit for the simple reason of being born into that family .
who cares ?
the money that is spun off the bus .
has already been taxed , so has the income that created a simple cash inheritance .
i dont have any dog in the fight .
especially since any estates i stand to inherit will fall well below the estate tax threshold .
plus my family has basically said they are gonna spend everything " they " earned before they die .
which i said more power to them .
i didnt feel entitled to their money because im their child .
its their money , i didnt do anything to help them earn it .
well if its ' their money ' than why are you campaigning to mess with mine ?
if i inherited 10 millon bucks it would mean absolutely zero zip nada to you or your situation .
[ quote=trajan ; 3117843 ]
well you see , people who built their own wealth to take care of their family are really greedy bastards who do n't deserve the fruits of their labor or the right to decide what to do with it .
the government has the right ......
nay , the obligation to recover a portion of that and hand it over to the common man who is n't as " lucky ".
but what if it were above the threshold and they want to give it to you ?
why would you feel the government is entitled to a portion of what your parents earned and paid taxes on ?
if it were above the threshold , i would be intelligent enough to retain a lawyer and explore the most economical ways to have the estate passed on .
there are many legal avenues to limit the estate tax .
and since they are not taxing my parents , and this is new money to me , then it has the right to be taxed .
im not championing the idea that i like taxes , but with it being new income to my person , it should be subject to taxes .
were you dropped on your head as a baby ?
no , seriously , were you ?
my father @-@ in @-@ law gave my son his father 's ( f @-@ i @-@ l 's dad and my sons great grandfather ) shotgun .
it was a family posession handed down from generation to generation .
should my son have been taxed by the government for this family gift ?
it does n't matter if it is a gun , a family picture album , a doily , your old man 's fishnet stocking leg lamp or his monetary fortune .
you posess it and it is yours to do what you choose with it .
why the fuck should the government be entitled to take a portion of my hard earned wealth i want to pass to my son so they can give it to some crack whore mother so she can have things she did n't work for .
hell , if she wants some of my money , she can come ask for a handout .
i 'm a very charitable person .
but i decide how and where my money goes .
i do n't need the gubmint being the middle man .
if you decided you need a piece of my financial pie and went about coming in my house to confiscate it for yourself , i 'd be justified in a court of law for putting a nice grouping in your chest to stop you .
why should the gubmint be able to do by force what citizens are not allowed to by gubmint law ?
get it thru your head .
a person 's possessions belongs to them and they can do with it what they will and can give it to whoever they choose .
you are not entitled to it if they do n't want you to have it and the gubmint should n't be able to take it by force and give it to you .
if they do .......
what are you going to give in return ?
gifting and estate taxes are separate issues .
and since the gun falls under the limit , its not taxed anyway .
try again ......
also , if you wanted to legally pass on your estate and it was over the $ 5m threshold , go hire and lawyer and he will be able to limit the estate taxes .
stop making excuses .
making excuses ?
would n't that be you thinking the government is entitled to part of a person 's estate ?
you 've never explained why the government has a right to it other than they can make rules and enforce them at gunpoint .
why is the government entitled to it ?
you 've never answered that .
this is income that was taxed when it was earned that has been passed to a family member ......
no different than some other possession .
why is the government entitled to it other than it is easy pickings and they can send people to your house with guns to get it ?
all income is taxed multiple times .
every time it changes hands it is taxed again .
your taxed on your income , then again on the sales , then again on property , then again and again .
its the same as you winning the lottery , its free money to the person who receives it .
an estate also doesnt necessarily have to be passed on to a family member .
should your neighbor or friend get it tax free as well ?
whats the difference there ?
not by the same entity .
yes , i pay federal and state taxes on each pay check .
when i go to the grocery store with the money i earned that the government actually allows me to keep , i pay a local sales tax .
my property taxes are to the county .
now , if i were being taxed on my income by the feds and then paying a federal tax at the gorcery store , you might have an argument .
the federal government already got a piece of the action each time i get paid .
if i choose to give money to my son , they are not entitled to retax what they already taxed .
it 's not your money anymore when you die .
in fact the royal " you " ain't anymore after you die .
your wealth is transferred elsewhere .
and when wealth is transferred , __name1__ gets his cut .
sorry dude .
__name1__ .
no estate tax .
i 'll help ya pack .
you got me ...
i am speechless.good luck in life .
where does it say that , exactly ?
one can alway 's choose to go into a life of crime , prostitution , smuggling , drugs , larceny , counter @-@ fitting , embezzlement , fraud , work on the level of experience , if you really want to go all out , apply it to becoming a lawyer , judge , politician , union boss , or community organizer .
i hear those skills translate real well into a career in government .
so i take it you do not live in a state or community that has an income or payroll tax ?
many communities have a payroll tax for the priveledge of working in their community whether you live in the community or not .
so the state taxes you on your income and then again with a sales tax when you spend it .
it is not that the tax exists , it is what is done with what is levied , it is about consent , it is about acting responsibly with a trust .
what is governments primary function again citizen ? ??
what are it 's powers ?
what are the limits to those powers ?
what is it 's obligation in relation to transparency ?
disclosure ?
rule of law ?
should the government account for what it takes ?
for what it spends ?
for hypocrisy ?
and guess how many businesses choose to invest capital in buildings , infrastructure and such in those communities .
we run like a bat out of hell when a municipality initiates taxes like that .
lower taxes means businesses are going there .
what is the governments primary function ?
well __value1__ of the __value1__ acts of the new __name1__ govt was to levy the whiskey tax which must be paid in specie at a time when much of frontier america existed primarially on barter .
__name1__ led a group group of soldiers larger than at any revoloutionary war battle into western pa to enforce the collection of the tax .
think about it .
ohh they give the businesses all kinds of tax free incentives even loans that do not have to be repaid to locate there .
and then collect the payroll tax off of the workers .
the businesses do not pay the payroll tax the workers do .
define " it ."
the authority to tax flows from the constitution , article 1 section 8 .
corresponding law specific to the estate tax can be found in the federal register .
if you 're asking where ' it ' says that when you die , it 's not your money anymore ...
i 'm not sure how to answer that .
i 'm not sure ' it ' says it anywhere ; that 's just the way it is .
a dead man does n't own anything .
that was a hamilton scheme of unfair taxation designed to benefit larger manufacturers and shut down independents .
hamilton also ran bond scams , where he misrepresented the value of the bonds convincing many to sell for pennies on the dollar .
is this the kind of leadership you want ?
may i suggest a good read ? ...
well i will anyway .
" reclaiming the american revolution ".
ahh yes my point is that the __name1__ has been hosed from the very beginning .
there is no good ol founding fathers days .
the employee 's and the customer 's pay , every time .
let us know when that sinks in ?
we wait with baited breath .
you did n't pay attention to what i said .
i live in __name1__ and we have a state income tax .
when i buy groceries , i pay local ( city ) taxes .
my property taxes are a county tax .
the state gets theirs off the top out of my income .
the city and the city alone gets a cut when i buy someting in a store .
the state does n't get a piece of that action .
they already got theirs when they taxed my income .
that 's right .........
because upon his death he bequeathed it to his family .
where in the constitution does it say that when you die , the government is entitled to your wealth ?
if you had no living relatives and you had no will directing a charity or something to leave your wealth to , i could see the government taking it .
but if you direct for your wealth to remain within your family , there is no logical reason for the government to demand a piece of it other than they can take it by force .
an income tax is not mentioned by name in the constitution , either .
neither is the __name1__ or the __name2__ .
something does not need to be mentioned by name in order to be constitutionally compliant .
with regards to the government being entitled to a percentage of certain estates upon death , that can be found in the federal register as i stated .
dude , the government is entitled to whatever they say they are entitled to .
they have guys with guns to enforce it .
does n't make it right .
constitutionally compliant is exactly what the __name1__ says it is , no more , no less , and only until the court revises it .
that is our system , not original intent , but constructive interpretation and law .
kind of arbitrary , with no means to challenge the __name1__ .
" i am conscious that an equal division of property is impracticable , but the consequences of this enormous inequality producing so much misery to the bulk of mankind , legislators cannot invent too many devices for subdividing property , only taking care to let their subdivisions go hand in hand with the natural affections of the human mind .
the descent of property of every kind therefore to all the children , or to all the brothers and sisters , or other relations in equal degree , is a politic measure and a practicable one .
another means of silently lessening the inequality of property is to exempt all from taxation below a certain point , and to tax the higher portions or property in geometrical progression as they rise " -- __name1__ ; letter to james madison ( __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ )
so we can count on your support of confiscatory inheritance taxes ?
i would like to know what right the federal government has in the taking of property that undoubtedly has been taxed many times over just because someone had the wherewithal to safeguard and put it good use before they passed from this life ?
why should a family farm for example have to be sold off to donate __value1__ % of the proceeds to the federal government ?
why should a husband and wife who busted their asses to accumulate an estate to pass on to their children see over half of it land in the hands of government bureaucrats who will then take that money and spend it on utter nonsense ?
a word of caution .....
if you want you head bitten off and treated as spewtum , give me that " civic duty " or " the price of freedom " bullshit ....
do n't forget that the parliament that oppressed the colonists were members of a landed aristocracy , so this was a great concern to the likes of __name1__ .
i do n't think that a flat __value1__ % rate is fair or conducive to " the great object ."
a progressive rate like that that __name1__ speaks of would be far better .
of course it would .
however , try convincing those in the class envy and war on wealth people on the political left .
" just __quant1__ years after __name2__ was passed , a __year1__ __name1__ study found that public spending on medical care had nearly doubled in the __value1__ few years of __name2__ .
the report concluded , " to date , the major demonstrable effect of the __year1__ federal legislation creating __name1__ and __name2__ has been a shift in financing medical care from the private to the public sector .
- __name1__ , __month1__ , __year1__ .
it 's the same story today , they selling us story that prices will go down .
they wont .
even lbj was lying about it back in sixties .
__name1__ maneuvered every step of the way getting this bill through __name2__ , and one of the things he did — and this is a little dicey in today 's climate — was suppress the costs .
so this young kid gets elected from __name1__ , __name2__ , in __year1__ , and __name3__ is explaining to him [ over the phone ] how you get a health bill through .
and what he tells him is do n't let them get the costs projected too far out because it will scare other people :
" a health program yesterday runs $ __quant1__ , but the fools had to go to projecting it down the road __quant2__ or __quant3__ years , and when you project it the __value1__ year , it runs $ __quant4__ .
now i do n't know whether i would approve $ __quant1__ __value1__ year or not .
i might approve 450 or 500 .
but the __value1__ thing __name1__ comes running in saying , ' my god , you 've got a __quant1__ @-@ dollar program for next year on health , therefore i 'm against any of it now .
' do you follow me ? "

what unrealistic assumptions ?
if you 're stupid enough to go out and buy a car ...
pay on it for __quant1__ years ....
and then pick up your __year1__ car from the dealership in __year2__ , then continue paying for it another __quant1__ years , go right ahead ....
it acutely describes your utter stupidity ....
furthermore it clearly demonstrates what a fucking scam this whole government run healthcare scheme is ! !!!.
if your too ignorant to see that the whole __name1__ argument is bullshit because of the pay for __quant1__ years and get __quant2__ years of benefit dupe that the con man president is pulling on you then you are even too stupid to post messages here any further ...
now there ....
that 's a post you can neg rep me for beowolfe .
patek , that 's only part of it .
the deception does not end there .
the bill also assumes savings by cutting __name1__ .
every time they have cut __name2__ the __name1__ has voted to restore funding .
why is this going to be different ?
but the __name1__ scoring also is good for just the __value1__ decade , when as you say payments precede benefits .
after that they admit they can n't score the thing .
and there is other stuff in there too that came out at the " bipartisan " meeting .
i just find it unconscientable that the __name1__ are bound and determined to commit political suicide with this flawed bill just to say " we won , you lost ."
this is what it is all about .
they could care less what happens to the country or the future generations of americans ...
as long as they win .
welcome to a bullshit high school popularity contest .
the immaturity of you __name1__ 's is pathetic .
i think it 's largely being driven by __name1__ and his advisors .
they desperately want this to prove they can get legislation passed .
they have been spanked on everything else for the last __quant1__ months .
they are so desperate they will tkae a pyrrhic victory .
good policy is the last thing on their minds .
since you all argue that no one read the bill , why would you believe what anyone says about the bill .
for those of you who are interested , read the __name1__ analysis for yourself .
<a href="http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/103xx/doc10310/06-15-kennedyletter.shtml"> preliminary analysis of major provisions related to health insurance coverage __name1__ choices act </a>
yes , the wonderful __name1__ , that takes all the rules and numbers given to it and renders possible results .
the __name1__ or its equivalent has been wrong on every social program 's cost .
with even the slightest bit of honesty you could at least admit this plan does n't reduce health care costs .
most of the leadership has already noted the rate of increase is suppose to decrease .
i guess that makes it affordable now and less affordable later huh ?

i think we will see a renewed energy pushing for term limits at the tea parties that are springing up all over the nation .
make sure to attend yours , i took the day off to go .
it 's __month1__ __day1__ th , check with your local chamber of commerce , they will be able to tell you where yours is at .
we the people already determine term limits with our vote .
find me anything in the constitution that can limit the terms of eligable people for the __name1__ or __name2__ .
it would take a constitutional amendment .
which is a waste of time and money .
i am beyond tired of lazy helpless people to stupid to exersize their rights with the vote .
do n't like a __name1__ or __name2__ critter , vote them out .
but no , we are to weak willed and helpless to actually do that , instead we want the government to make it easy for us by forcing people out so we do n't have to actually think or exersize our minds and rights .
this is so __value1__ % on the mark .
why should a very good legislator be limited in how long he @/@ she can serve ?
we have the opportunity every election cycle to remove anyone from office who is not representing our interests .
if we are too dumb that we can be bought off with slick advertising then we deserve what we get .
you can bet your buckwheat that if the writers of our constitution were alive today they would have wrote in term limits for the __name1__ and the __name2__ .
they would have been disgusted at what we see on __quant1__ basis , corruption , special interests in the back pockets of our so @-@ called leaders and those politicians living the life of riley , staying on the government gravy train until they die .
they most certainly would not have wanted this and it is clear that this needs to change , let 's bring to the forfront the need for term limits and get it done this time .
it will be a fight but i beleive it 's a fight that we the people can win .
how about no pay __name1__ knows there all over paid
oh , there is another -- a meterologist ....
i doubt their salary is as high though .
all of us want change , this is not a partisan issue , it does not matter if you are a __name1__ , __name2__ , independent , conservative or liberal .
we are not going to get significant change until we the people impose term limitaions on __name1__ and the __name2__ .
too many congressmen and senators have made a career out of a political office , __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , __name5__ , __name6__ , and the list goes on and on .
they become entrenched in their white ivory towers , forgetting what it 's like in the real world .
they succomb to special interest groups , they become corrupt with power and money from these groups and eventually they entirely ignore their constituants .
is it any wonder to any of you why this country seems so divided .
i do n't beleive that we the people are divided , i believe our __name1__ and __name2__ are .
they all form their clicks , play their power games , and in the end , get nothing done for the __name1__ people .
i think that most of us want the same thing , affordable health care , energy independence , , an educational system that works and a social security system that is feasible and won't be bankrupt for future generations .
we need a government that can balance a budget , use tax payer dollars efficiently , eliminates waste and fraud , and creates opportunities for growth in the private sector .
we will never get there with entrenched politicians who have made careers out of being ego centric , counter productive individuals whose only concern is power and money and getting their faces on television in order to be re @-@ elected .
most of these politicians have never had to work __quant1__ real day in their lives , they have an omnipotent veiw of themselves and really think that we the people could not live without their leadership .
we can , and we would do a much better job with new people with fresh ideas .
the new ones want to do what is right , they have not had the time to be corrupted by special interest groups or old entrenched politicians .
let 's give them each __quant1__ terms and then there out .
that 's the only way we are ever going to get the change we need and want in this country .
support term limits and get to your tea party on the __day1__ th of __month1__ .
this is the real change this country needs .
we have term limits in the __name1__ .
how 's that going for you ?
it 's almost funny the way that some rs just assume that if there were term limits , repubs would win the majority back .
when will you all accept the rejection of __name2__ policies in __year1__ and __year2__ by the __name1__ voters ?
__value1__ of the __value1__ steps in recovery is acceptance .
people are too stupid & lazy ....
term limits , the way __name1__ intended it to be ....
i do n't hate __name1__ .
i find her to be funny , charming and quite engaging as a person .
i disagree with her fundamentally on several key issues and therefore would not vote for a ticket that she was on .
ok ...
i 'll bite ...
what issues ?
are you pissed she would n't say what mags she reads ?
did you hear her explanation for that ?
are you pissed she asked a slimball to clarify what he meant by " the __name1__ doctrine "?
which of course you know is a creation of the msm and can mean a variety of things ...
think she was too cautious with reporters trying to " gotcha " her .... ?
think she was treated fairly in the media , saaaay , compared to bho ?
did __name1__ __quant1__ states gaff get a lot of airtime ?
how about __name1__ saying __name2__ and __name3__ are the __quant1__ state left to visit ?
did that make it to sat .
n. live or __name1__ or the __name2__ or the news for a weeks coverage ?
how about __name1__ and his numerous gaffs ....
a lot of coverage on them every night , did __name1__ have a few jokes about him or bho ?
i voted for __name1__ during the primaries and would have been satisfied if she won the nomination .
as a rule , i vote for women running for __name1__ and city counsil position before i vote for men , regardless of party .
i think it 's categorically false to say that women hate women just to hate them .
there is usually a basis for that hate .
sometimes the basis if jealousy or bitterness .
sometimes it 's much more tangible .
it seems that women started turning on __name1__ when palin started talking .
perhaps the main issue with __name1__ is that she poorly represents women and therefore is looked upon as setting back our efforts to gain respect and position in national politics .
__name1__ lost the primary not because women turned on her..
quite the opposite .
she lost the primary because she forgot to run an honorable campaign .
she turned into the dirty mud slinging typical politician .
for her it was more about winning that showing some integrity .
i believe if she had n't sunk so low and made so many personal attacks she might 've gotten the nod for vp .
__name1__ burned her own bridge there .
__name1__ did too .
__value1__
okay , fair enough .
then those some women are stupid .
it is n't any woman 's fault that she does n't like __name1__ , btw . it 's __name2__ 's fault , and her job , to make people like her .
and pissing and moaning that all these women are somehow at fault is ridiculous .
no one is blaming the women , silly .
they were born that way .
some polls are suggesting that after gaining an initial bump , __name2__ 's campaign is being hobbled by __name1__ 's vice @-@ presidential candidacy .
the voters who are deserting her fastest , some of whom are even calling on her to withdraw , are mostly women .
ah , women , the consistently , tragically underestimated constituency .
what the __name1__ learned during the primaries and the __name2__ might now be finding out the hard way , i learned at my very academic , well @-@ regarded all @-@ girls high school : that is never to discount the ability of women to open a robust , committed , well @-@ thought @-@ out vat of hatred for another girl .
women are weapons @-@ grade haters .
__name1__ knows it .
__name1__ knows it too .
when women get their hate on , they do n't just dislike , or find disfavor with , or sort of not really appreciate .
they loathe — deeply , richly , sustainingly .
i do not say this to disparage my gender ; women also love in more or less the same way .

wow , i do n't that could have been a more offensive article about women .
i have sent that to numerous of my lady friends and they were not pleased .
they are now in the process of writing letters to the author and i guarantee you they are not positive .
plays right into the stereotypes of women and is quite sad if you ask me .
sounds like a female writing for her male editors to me .
i 'm always amazed at how little some dudes understand the fairer sex .
women do n't like __name1__ because she 's unqualified and rightwing
oh yes--the poor female can n't think for herself and is being forced to write bad shit in the back room where she is chained up .
besides--sterotypes all have some general truths in them or they would n't exist .
what we need to do is stop and consider what we want in a candidate , rather than we just do n't like their party .
that is , if we are being honest to ourselves .
for example , are earmarks a bad thing or a good thing ?
maybe it is the responsibility of a politician to grab all he can for his constituents .
therefor __name1__ might be considered lazy .
does a politician who spend all his time shaking down the money tree for his district really do that much of a disservice ?
there are a lot of inter related issues in the drilling debate .
the __name1__ have framed it in terms of national security .
that is not the end of it .
the __name1__ have framed it in terms of responsible stewardship .
and that is not the end of that either .
my personal preference is to ride a bike to work .
i live __quant1__ miles away , and i just like riding my bike .
i am a bit of an evangelist , as i think everyone else who can ought to as well .
i am nearly __quant1__ , so it is n't that hard .
i do my shopping usually on the way home .
i am now single , so i only have to shop for me .
shopping for more people on the bike would be harder , i know .
do we really need to send all that cash that we spend on oil to kleptocratic theocracies like __name1__ and __name2__ ?
do we really , for that matter , need to make a mess of out our environment either ?
the reality i see is that petroleum is still substantially cheaper than biofuels .
the folks who do chemestry are working really hard to change that , but they have n't yet .
so that is the choice we have to make , rationally .
i personally think spending money on regimes like __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , etc etc is dangerous .
the caribou are just going to have to live with it .
but that is my feeling on the matter , your mileage may vary .
but we have to recognize these are both valid choices and we have to come down on one or the other .
it really is your call
this maybe an oversimplification but does n't it come down to the fact that we need income---we need to decide the optimal ( moral ? )
way of doing that and then prioritize our spending ?
we had lower year over year ( yoy ) spending under __name1__ too .
it was the combination of lower spending and higher taxes that generated a surplus .
__name1__ is n't going to cut spending and __name2__ will only focus on a quarter of __value1__ percent represented by " bad " earmarks .
there is no shot at a balanced budget under either man .
__name1__ is going to cut spending by $ __quant1__ dollars __quant2__ year .
he is going to get us out of __name1__ .
because the money gets spent to the federal government for lease payments , and for __name1__ workers and equipment , and does not get spent enriching governments and dictators that do n't exactly have our best interest at heart .
and the oceans will no longer rise and the planet will begin to heal itself .
let me try this one .
social security benefits have their limits and regardless how much money you make , you cant get more from social security then you put in over the time .
yes
when talking about fairness , if you remove cap on payroll tax , woudn't be fair to remove cap on social security benefits and give to rich equivalent in social security based on how much money they put in .
not a bad idea .
so if cap is ( rounded ) $ 100k , your ss check is ( wild guess ) $ __quant1__ .
if you remove cap on rich and tax them across the board , would be fair to still pay them social security just $ __quant1__ or maybe more , since they paid more taxes .
the cap on ssi is too low .
no , __name1__ wants to remove the cap on payrol and keep the cap on ss benefits .
fair enough ?
a complaint that this liberal thinks has merit .
while i do believe there should be some cap , i certainly think it 's set artificially low , now .
somebody who , under __name1__ 's plan , contributes huge amounts of money to the system deserves to get back more of that money than they currently do .
that was one of the most pointless replies i 've ever seen .
instead of defending __name2__ , you went on an attack against __name1__ .
try staying on subject :
__name1__ is a foreign policy disaster in the making .
the weirdest thing that wingers do n't get is that defining people as ' liberal ' or ' leftist ' does n't mean that they 're wrong or bad :
in the __decade1__ s we were a terrible nation .
we were at war fighting against the sovereignty of the __name1__ people .
we were the bad guys ! !!
that war violated every principle that __name1__ was founded on .
the treatment of non @-@ white people was attrocious .
few people under the age of __quant1__ remember how bad it was .
while the personal suffering of individuals who were killed by leftist bombers is a horrible thing , these leftist radicals were fighting for a just cause .
in the end they won .
this country changed dramatically because of them .
at the same time , does __name1__ ever consider the people that he most likely killed or maimed ?
he believed in his cause , but that does n't mean that he should completely disregard the innocent people that were killed by his bombs :
a bomber in a neat uniform with a nice haircut , flying a jet airplane is still a bomber .
not one word from him of concern for these people .
why liberals do n't normally win the presidency ....
it 's funny you put a hit piece about a man who fought for his country and sacrificed physically .
a man who refused early release so that he did n't abandon his fellow soliders .
while you defend radicals that bomb innocent people .
__name1__ followed the orders he was given by his commanders and i do n't think you will find too many __name2__ that will support a position of our soliders being some type of thugs .
while there are a few __name1__ on here that will support that , you all are the minority even in your party( at least i hope so ) .
i can find a lot of faults with __name1__ but his sevice to our country is n't one of them .
he has a lot of experience where foregn policy is concerned , but i disagree with most of his positions on __name1__ affairs that seem to have got us bogged down fighting a war on __quant1__ fronts .
i doubt he would show much restraint where military force is concerned .
ayup !
i am glad you support the troops ....
although , i disagree that __name1__ will send troops into harm 's way at every whim .
__name1__ is losing it .
everytime i see him speak , there is a pause and then his ingratiating little smile or smirk appears .
i never trusted people who laugh at their own so called funnies even when they are n't funny .
he calls __name1__ an elitist while he mc cain owns __quant1__ homes and his wife is worth __quant2__ .
he talks about his religious foundations , but he cheated on his __value1__ wife and divorced her when she gained weight after taking prescribed medicine after an accident .
he was against the tax breaks and drilling and is now for it .
he says he backs the troops but has consistently voted against bills that support more education and medical benefits .
it 's his last time , he knows it , and will say or do what ever he needs to to win .
and no one is pushing the singing songbird of __name1__ angle .
the left does n't has the skill the right had in twisting __name1__ 's service with the turdboat veterans .
part of the right success in the mud slinging is their audience ,
<a href="http://earthhopenetwork.net/forum/showthread.php?tid=385"> fellow pow ? __name1__ john mccain was a coward and a traitor in viet nam </a>
__name1__ worked his way up , but __name2__ slept his way to the top with his wife 's mob money .
is your health care rationed ?
yes it is .
there are procedures and medications the government does not cover .
in my specific case several medications i take i can not get at the military hospital because they are not on the list of approved medications so instead i have to use the __name1__ system and pay my share rather then get them for free .
and some of them require lots of paper work from the doctor to justify every time it is due for refill .
i have bad legs , i need support stockings to keep from losing my legs , guess what ?
the stockings are expensive and the government does not pay at all for them , no cost share or anything , not tricare and not medicare .
__quant1__ had to spend weeks in physical therapy with my legs wrapped to get the swelling down enough to get the stockings .
all the material i had to buy for those treatments was also not covered .
__quant1__ can not currently get __quant2__ of the meds __quant2__ have taken for __quant2__ because the government refuses to pay for it anymore , no cost share nothing , __quant2__ either have to not take it or pay for it out of pocket .
currently none of the procedures i have been recommended for are on the no go list , but it exists .
further in the va hospital where i could get free treatment there is a laundry list of meds and procedures they simply do not authorize ever .
it is the same for active duty , new procedures that were not pioneered by military doctors take __quant1__ to get approved before they are authorized by the military .
wars can speed the process up but as soon as the war is over it goes back to the same old slow approval process .
dependents that are on the cheapest ( for them ) system of __name1__ must wait for space in the military hospitals or ask for special permission to go out of system ( not always approved ) and military hospitals are short staff and priority is given active duty , as it should be .
i chose the more expensive method for __name2__ because currently __name1__ pays my deductible or rather between the two i generally pay nothing for routine care .
i did that before i had __name1__ and paid the extra because if i had signed on for the other way i would have lost my doctors and had to only go through the military and their approved doctors .
i am __quant1__ miles from a __name1__ hospital so except for a few stays in the mental ward when i was very depressed and could not afford to pay the civilian hospital i do not use it .
when i am up there i can not see my family at all .
__quant1__ was in and out of the wards , civilian and __name1__ 2 or 3 times __quant1__ year from 96 to __year1__ .
i did not have __name1__ and had to pay __value1__ percent of the allowed bill every stay if civilian .
i was not able to work when i was in the hospital and was only getting about __quant1__ dollars in retirement pay , the wife worked at a low paying job as well .
my doctor even forgave __quant1__ stays cause i could not pay , he was on the board and just had them write off my part of the bill .
rationing is a fact of life .
it is pretty loose right now for __name1__ and the military but not for __name2__ and it sure as hell won't be for long when the government suddenly has to pay billions more for everyone .
on veterans day i just wanted to say this pisses me off to no end .
it may be the sadest most disgusting thing i have ever read .
most of the time i am of the opinion that people should bare some financial burden for their medical expenses , but if there is __quant1__ group of people that should get free health care , it 's veterans .
that you have to deal with this crap after serving is absolutely disgusting .
it sounds as if your health care coverage rations in the exact same way that private health care does .
the real difference is that your overall coverage cost is cheaper for you ...
which is proof of what i 've been telling you people all along .
cheaper does not equal better access , which is suppossedly the goal .
we are going down like a rock ....
and __name1__ ain't a smidgen of the reasons why ....
i heard this morning on c @-@ span the state governments in the __name1__ have a $ __quant1__ dollar obligation to government employee retirements .
and the federal government has similar obligations for the retirement pensions and health care fof their exemployees , and the military with their exemployees ....
i do n't know if this health care proposal of the __name1__ will reduce the speed of the health care prices or save some money in the long run ....
or cost us more , but even without __quant1__ thing done with this health care bill ....
we , as a country , are in deep deep crapola .
that 's what happens when you try to live off the backs of the successful hardworking people and live beyond your means
i do n't understand ?
are those of us who have not worked for the government " the backs of the successful hard working people ", and the ones trying to live off of us ' retired government workers '?
every cent the goverment has comes from taxes----where do you think they get they money to pay the employees ?
we can not afford socialized medicine .
we already can not afford medicare .
yet by adding millions more suddenly all will be fine ?
the primary reasons why medicare runs in the red is the majority of those covered by medicare subsidized by payroll taxes are n't paying premiums .
only $ __quant1__ of its income of nearly $ __quant2__ comes from its client base --- which are statistically the sickest demographic ( seniors and disabled ) and with a larger healthier client base , that means more money in revenue vs expenditures .
cover everyone with medicare , and the size and overall health of their client base goes up along with the revenue income from premiums .
everyone that works pays into medicare .
everyone .
there is no other way to put it .
medicare is already subsidized by our taxes from every person in this country that works .
and it fails miserably .
no it does n't .
i 'm not sure that is true .
those who make their income , their living , through investments do not pay medicare taxes .
and it does not fail miserably , if we had no medicare at all , then look at it ...
you will know what failure is .
in addition to this the private insurance industry is plagued by the same problem and is one reason why we pay higher rates for our own health insurance policies .
this is not a copyrighted article and is old , from __year1__ talking about the problem ....
back then they said it was $ __quant1__ __quant2__ year in total and $ __quant3__ of it was medicare , so the private industry is filled with it .
mostly private businesses are the ones committing the crimes against medicare and the insurance industry .
insurance fraud and abuse : · a very serious problem · __name1__ , m.d.
fraud and abuse are widespread and very costly to __name1__ 's health @-@ care system .
fraud involves intentional deception or misrepresentation intended to result in an unauthorized benefit .
an example would be billing for services that are not rendered .
abuse involves charging for services that are not medically necessary , do not conform to professionally recognized standards , or are unfairly priced .
an example would be performing a laboratory test on large numbers of patients when only a few should have it .
abuse may be similar to fraud except that it is not possible to establish that the abusive acts were done with an intent to deceive the insurer .
although no precise dollar amount can be determined , some authorities contend that insurance fraud constitutes a $ 100 @-@ billion @-@ a @-@ year problem .
the __name2__ __name1__ ( gao ) estimates that $ __quant1__ out of every $ __quant2__ spent on medicare is lost to fraud and abuse and that in __year1__ alone , medicare lost nearly $ __quant3__ to fraudulent or unnecessary claims [ 1 ] .
type of fraud and abuse
false claim schemes are the most common type of health insurance fraud .
the goal in these schemes is to obtain undeserved payment for a claim or series of claims [ 2 ] .
such schemes include any of the following when done deliberately for financial gain :
* billing for services , procedures , and @/@ or supplies that were not provided .
* misrepresentation of what was provided ; when it was provided ; the condition or diagnosis ; the charges involved ; and @/@ or the identity of the provider recipient .
* providing unnecessary services or ordering unnecessary tests [ 3 ] .
many insurance policies cover a percentage of the physician 's " usual " fee .
some physicians charge insured patients more than uninsured ones but represent to the insurance companies that the higher fee is the usual one .
this practice is illegal .
it is also illegal to routinely excuse patients from copayments and deductibles .
( a copayment is a fixed dollar amount paid whenever an insured person receives specified health @-@ care services .
a deductible is the amount that must be paid before the insurance company starts paying .)
it is legal to waive a fee for people with a genuine financial hardship , but it is not legal to provide completely free care or discounts to all patients or to collect only from those who have insurance .
studies have shown that if patients are required to pay for even a small portion of their care they will be better consumers and select items or services because they are medically needed rather than because they are free .
routine waivers thus raise overall health costs .
they are considered fraudulent because averaging them with the doctor 's full fees would make the " usual " fees lower than the amounts actually billed for .
other illegal procedures include :
* charging for a service that was not performed .
* unbundling of claims : billing separately for procedures that normally are covered by a single fee .
an example would be a podiatrist who operates on __quant1__ toes and submits claims for __quant2__ separate operations .
* double billing : charging more than once for the same service .
* upcoding : charging for a more complex service than was performed .
this usually involves billing for longer or more complex office visits ( for example , charging for a comprehensive visit when the patient was seen only briefly ) , but it also can involve charging for a more complex procedure than was performed or for more expensive equipment than was delivered .
medicare documentation guidelines describe what the various levels of service should involve [ 4 ] .
* miscoding : using a code number that does not apply to the procedure .
* kickbacks : receiving payment or other benefit for making a referral .
indirect kickbacks can involve overpayment for something of value .
for example , a supplier whose business depends on physician referrals may pay excessive rent to physicians who own the premises and refer patients .
another example would be a mobile testing service that performs diagnostic tests in a doctor 's office .
kickbacks can distort medical decision @-@ making , cause overutilization , increase costs , and result in unfair competition by freezing out competitors who are unwilling to pay kickbacks .
they can also adversely affect the quality of patient care by encouraging physicians to order services or recommend supplies based on profit rather than the patients ' best medical interests .
in __year1__ , the __name1__ issued a fraud alert warning against kickbacks disguised as rental payments [ 5 ] .
criminals sometimes obtain medicare numbers for fraudulent billing by conducting a health survey , offering a free " health screening " test , paying beneficiaries for their number , obtaining beneficiary lists from nursing homes or boarding facilities , or offering " free " services , food , or supplies to beneficiaries .
excessive or inappropriate testing
many standard tests can be useful in some situations but not in others .
the key question in judging whether a diagnostic test is necessary is whether the results will influence the management of the patient .
billing for inappropriate tests—both standard and nonstandard—appears to be much more common among chiropractors and joint chiropractic @/@ medical practices than among other health @-@ care providers .
the commonly abused tests include :

can you believe there are dumb asses in here so partisan , they are actually defending the insurance companies .
here is a hint , if you like paying that much money per month , with no end in sight , pay it .
leave the rest of __name1__ alone .
dont touch your insurance ...
they wont .
dont touch the rest of __name1__ 's choice .
__name1__ have been saying that they are all for the elimination of private health insurance .
do n't believe me , watch the videos in this thread :
__name1__ href="http://www.usmessageboard.com/healthcare-insurance-govt-healthcare/91753-democrats-admit-that-the-public-option-will-lead-to-single-payer-government-run-care.html"> democrats admit that the public option will lead to single payer government run care </a>
how many jobs will that costs ?
__quant1__ am not just talking about the ceos and upper management jobs but how many jobs of people like you and me who work hard every day just to put dinner on the table will be lost .
from the janitor to middle management and do n't forget the little guys , the independent agents who work for you to get you coverage .
those ceo 's employ you ; your brothers , sisters , parents , children , friends .
where are those people going to go when the private health insurer disappears ?
how many hundreds of thousands of jobs ( __name1__ jobs ) are going to be lost ?
what industry do you work in ?
is your job safe ?
edit : oh and let me ask you this , are n't you glad __name1__ and __name2__ are working so hard to eliminate those jobs ?
immie
i do n't think you understand what the public option would do .
then again , perhaps you do n't :

regional inequities in health care reform · posted on __month1__ __day1__ th , __year1__ by kbh in featured , health
in the pending health care bills , low @-@ income individuals and families who buy health insurance outside employment will get large government subsidies .
those subsidies vary by locale .
this represents a significant implicit policy decision with enormous distributional and political consequences .
i do n’t think most members or their constituents have focused on this .
i think they should ...
now let ’s look at what the __name1__ bill does for the new low @-@ income subsidies to purchase health insurance outside of employment .
here is the key sentence from the conceptual description of the __name1__ @-@ reported bill ( labeled as page 27 , it ’s page 30 of the __name2__ ) .
the premium credit amount would be tied to the __value1__ lowest @-@ cost silver plan in the area where the individual resides .
this is approach ( 2 ) ( and it becomes clear it ’s the extreme when you study the details ) .
if you live in an area with relatively inexpensive health plans , low @- and moderate @-@ income people in your area will receive smaller government subsidies than their similarly @-@ situated identical twins who live in relatively high @-@ cost areas .
a “ health plan ” is not a commodity like “ __quant1__ gallon of milk.” a health plan in __name1__ is quite different from __quant1__ in __name2__ .
while the overall cost @-@ of @-@ living in __name2__ is higher , health care spending is much higher in __name1__ .
this higher health spending is a function of different prices and different usage of medical care .
__name1__ wrote a much @-@ discussed article on this topic in __name3__ , “ the cost conundrum : what a __name2__ town can teach us about health care.” there are wide geographic dispersions in medical care spending , and it cannot all be explained by different prices .
while i disagree with __name1__ ’s policy conclusions , i recommend the article ....
it 's rather long , has lots of links , but is easy enough to understand ...
i would have called for the __name1__ closing their death camps , if it were n't for the secretaries , janitors and people that were employed sweeping the ashes out of the ovens ...
hey pea brain ...
__name1__ employs people ...
where 's the outrage ? ??
" __quant1__ percent of __name3__ are just __name2__ that do n't know what 's going on " · __name1__
immie
fewer jobs means more people on the unemployment line .
i 'm not talking about protecting the industry itself but the individuals like you and i who survive because of it .
but you are n't taking capital out of the system and it is capital that creates jobs .
this is the same argument the left used against free trade and it was a fallacy then and a fallacy now .
but , if you eliminate the company , you eliminate the capital .
those companies will disappear .
the competition is in the fact that if i ( employer generally ) do n't like the services @/@ costs offered by __name2__ i can take my business to __name1__ .
__quant1__ years ago my employer had __name1__ as its provider .
last year , __name1__ offered us a better deal with rates and deductibles so we switched to aetna .
this year , __name1__ came back with competitive rates and now i am back with __name1__ .
next year ?
will my employer have such a choice ?
not sure what you mean here .
it is always , no matter what industry we are speaking of , the provider that determines the price .
it is the purchaser that decides whether or not he @/@ she is willing to pay that price .
when i go to the store tomorrow for bread , the price is already set .
i can pay that price or i can go down the street and see if the next store has a better price .
i can n't go into the __value1__ store and say , " your bread is over priced and sliced to thick .
__quant2__ 'll give you $ __quant1__ for a loaf ."
i have to pay the price the store is asking or go without .
so , i 'm not sure what you mean here .
true , it will not happen over night .
it will happen ( if __name1__ correct number ? )
were passed it would take no longer than __quant1__ years before many of the insurers were driven out of business .
as for your postal service example , it is a decent __quant1__ , but there is __quant1__ major difference between the postal service and the public option @/@ health insurance idea .
the government has not mandated that __name1__ provide its services at $ __quant1__ per delivery whereas under the health care plans that have been debated , private insurers are required to provide identical policies at identical prices as the public option and no other policies will be allowed .
nor will insurers be allowed to offer policies to new customers .
those __quant1__ facts , in and of themselves will kill the industry and the videos discussed above prove that this is the goal of our elected politicians.immie
true , if that is indeed what hr3200 does .
where does it say that though ?
do you have a page number ?
no page number and i have not read it in a while , but i think ...
think mind you , can n't swear to it , that it was section 102 .
although , plymco_pilgrim was keeping a good watch on that bill .
betcha he can tell you exactly how many sentences down from the __value1__ page it is .
okay , maybe not sentences , but lines ?
the question should be why would employers want to deal with this year after year ?
how did healthcare get so tied up with employment ?
i would think the employers would welcome the opportunity to be able to get out of healthcare problems and run their companies .
it would be a boon to them and they could put more of their money into their business , rather than employee healthcare .
sure you would have bfgrn , sure you would have ?
just kidding !
so now you are comparing __name1__ citizens who happen to work for legal corporations doing the business of keeping you alive with nazis that ran concentration camps ?
i do n't see anyone putting __name1__ out of business do you ?
i think the president just signed a stimulus package earlier this year , that rewarded them for their service quite well .
in much the same manner as __name1__ rewarded __name2__ for its services .
immie
except that they are not being given a way out .
in fact , those who have now either chosen or been forced to drop their employee 's coverage will be forced to either pick it up again or pay a fine aka tax , for not providing coverage .
i stated earlier that my employer cannot afford it , yet , he continues to insist that his company provides it to the employees .
many companies simply cannot afford it and have been forced out of the market to the detriment of the employees and every year more and more companies or being forced out .
now , companies are going to be required to cover their employees or be taxed __value1__ % of their payroll ?
ouch !
small business is going to get creamed .
you would n't need to penalize businesses with a single payer plan .
it would work like __name1__ ...
a portion of your income goes toward the program .
businesses can n't opt out of __name1__ , if they would they 'd be penalized .
and again , if no one has to worry about insurance , all kinds of creative stuff could happen .
imo it would be a boon for anyone with a business plan that was afraid to make a move because they 'd be without insurance ( as it often happens now ) .
many insurance companies will convert to the supplemental health insurance business and elective surgery health insurance ....
also , most of these insurance companies diversify their investments .
well , a government run plan would have to hire people , too , so it 's not clear to me how many jobs net would be lost or gained .
what we do know is that if private insurance were replaced by government run insurance similar to __name3__ 's system , massive amounts of capital that insurance companies now invest in our private sector economy would be diverted to buy treasuries , as __name1__ and __name2__ do with their reserve funds , and to pay for the federal government 's deficits .
i 've got to think that withdrawing this much capital from private investment would have a negative effect on economic growth and job creation .
providing a government option would put health care out of business exactly the same way the __name1__ put __name2__ and __name3__ out of business .
it would be exactly the same .
no difference at all .
the __name1__ law does n't suck ...
before there was a __name1__ law , when you lost your job , you lost your health insurance ...
the higher __name1__ premium reflects a ) the loss of employer participation and b ) medical providers cut huge deals for employer based insurance claims and the soak the shit out of individual policies ...
why are you so f_cking stupid ? ??
why are you ?
you get laid off your job , in the next __quant1__ days you get a letter from your employer telling you that you have the option to continue your health insurance coverage .
within the next __quant2__ days or so , you have to pay last month 's and next month 's health insurance premiums and you must maintain your payments throughout your unemployment and most likely for the __quant1__ days until your new employer picks up your coverage .
that is impossible for the vast majority of people .
what part of that do n't you understand , idiot ?
oh , and by the way , with the __name1__ laws , if you can n't pay you still lose your coverage .
what part of that do n't you understand , stupid ?
immie
well pea brain , you are officially qualified as a dolt ...
what part of before __name1__ there will be no phone call , just a " you are canceled " notice in the mail ...
btw , if the phone call comes __quant1__ days later , then last months premium is past due ...
if you lose you job and can n't afford __name1__ , you probably can n't afford any health insurance , but you can apply for new insurance , but now any illness covered before you lost your job is now a preexisting condition ...
coverage denied for that affliction ...
you are a drowning victim that is thrown a life jacket and whines that he wants a cabin cruiser ...
if you want free health care , move to __name1__ ! !!
just imagine ( requires brains and empathy ) where the elderly would be today without __name1__ ( government run health care ) , you know ; those useless people that lose their job because they are too old to work leave the workforce ...
but , help is here ...
thanks to the evil __name1__ ! !!
the __name1__ of __year1__ as signed by __name2__ includes a __value1__ % subsidy to employees for __name3__ @-@ enabled insurance for up to __quant1__ months after an involuntary termination .
an employee is eligible for this subsidy if
* the termination of employment was involuntary , · * the terminated employee has no other group sponsored health insurance option , and · * the terminated employee is otherwise eligible to enroll in __name1__ .
you are the one that wants free health care , not me and by the way the proposals going through __name1__ right now are not going to be free .
yes , before __name1__ , an employee was without , after cobra the employee is still without .
the __name1__ law sucked .
it did n't help and the __name1__ does n't help a whole hell of a lot either .
the problem is that normal laidoff person could not ( pre @-@ __name1__ ) and still cannot ( post arra ) afford health insurance during such a period .
it does n't help at all .
__name1__ is an effort to improve conditions , but it is not sufficient for most people who when laid off have to worry about where the mortgage is going to come from and can n't even begin to worry about how they can pay health insurance premiums .
even with __name1__ it is out of reach .
that is why the __name1__ laws suck .
<a href="http://cthealth.server101.com/the_case_for_universal_health_care_in_the_united_states.htm"> the case for universal health care __name1__ united states </a>
why does n’t the __name1__ have universal health care as a right of citizenship ?
the __name1__ is the only industrialized nation that does not guarantee access to health care as a right of citizenship .
__quant1__ industrialized nations have single payer universal health care systems , while __quant2__ ( __name1__ ) has a multipayer universal health care system like president __name2__ proposed for the __name3__ .
myth one : the __name1__ has the best health care system in the world .
fact one : the __name1__ ranks __value1__ rd in infant mortality , down from __value2__ th in __year1__ and __value3__ st in __year2__
fact two : the __name1__ ranks __value1__ th in life expectancy for women down from __value2__ st in __year1__ and __value3__ th in __year2__
fact three : the __name1__ ranks __value1__ st in life expectancy for men down from __value2__ st in __year1__ and __value3__ th in __year2__ .
fact four : the __name1__ ranks between __value1__ th and __value2__ th in immunizations depending on the immunization .
overall __name1__ is __value1__ th , right behind __name2__
fact five : outcome studies on a variety of diseases , such as __name1__ disease , and renal failure show the __name2__ to rank below __name3__ and a wide variety of industrialized nations .
conclusion : the __name1__ ranks poorly relative to other industrialized nations in health care despite having the best trained health care providers and the best medical infrastructure of any industrialized nation
myth two : universal health care would be too expensive · fact one : the __name1__ spends at least __value1__ % more per capita on health care than any other industrialized country with universal health care
fact two : federal studies by the __name1__ and the __name2__ show that single payer universal health care would save 100 to __quant1__ dollars per year despite covering all the uninsured and increasing health care benefits .
fact three : state studies by __name1__ and __name2__ have shown that single payer universal health care would save __quant1__ to __quant2__ dollars per year from the total medical expenses in those states despite covering all the uninsured and increasing health care benefits
fact four : the costs of health care in canada as a % of gnp , which were identical to the __name1__ when canada changed to a single payer , universal health care system in __year1__ , have increased at a rate much lower than the __name1__ , despite the us economy being much stronger than canada ’s .
conclusion : single payer universal health care costs would be lower than the current __name1__ system due to lower administrative costs .
the __name1__ spends __value1__ to __value2__ % more on administration than single payer systems .
by lowering these administrative costs the __name1__ would have the ability to provide universal health care , without managed care , increase benefits and still save money .
" the best health care " and these statistics are interesting to post together , but may or may not have any relation to each other .
all of these stats have more to do with personal choices than the care recieved should some health crisis arise .
red meat and overeating among the most prevelant .
how is the consumption of __name1__ world wide compared to __name2__ ?
save money ?
how much longer will it be before the __name1__ plan is bankrupt ?
the acid test of this plan will be this :
if the __name2__ and the __name1__ vote to adopt this , they must also vote to dissolve the current plans that they are using and use only this plan as their medical coverage .
if they do not do this , it is inferior .
period .
i disagree .
when you are comparing market outcomes for a population of __quant1__ individuals , their personal choices make a huge difference on the study outcome , but when comparing a population of __quant2__ individuals , marketplace and business environment are what will affect the numbers .
the statistics posted are easy enough to read without interpretation .
regarding the ' acid test ' you are dead @-@ nuts , right @-@ on @-@ the @-@ money correct .
if __name1__ does not put themselves on to the exact same plan that the rest of us get , it is time to storm the castle with pitch @-@ forks .
starting in __year1__ all newly hired __name2__ employees , including congresscritters , were put on fica __name1__ and the __name3__ began to be grandfathered out .
as soon as we can get rid of the __name2__ deadwood , especially in leadership , hired before __year1__ , making sure __name1__ is properly funded will become a priority .
-@ joe
single universal hc would bring some reductions to the cost of hc insurance premiums as __value1__ % of all hc rpremiums are spent on administrative costs .
compared to __value1__ % administration expenses spent on all __name1__ and __name2__ .
nevertheless i do not believe single payer universal hc will really solve the problems we 're facing .
we must increase the supply of hc at the same time in order to really take this problem by the balls .
as organizations like the __name1__ actually work to limit the number of mds , they are working to keep the cost of medicine up , not working to bring it down .
you got that right , bro '.
it is disgusting the amount of professional care , like homeopathic medicine and herbal products that are at the least dismissed , and at most illegal due to the power of drug lobbyists and the fear of competition that the people those lobbyists work for have .
every time i pick up an herbal or supplement , i look at the bottle and see " the effectiveness of this product has not been studied by the __name1__ ".
why the fuck not ? !?!?
we , the people should be providing information to the populace , not just arresting people for selling grapefruit as a ' cure ' for scurvy .

iatrogenesis does n't just effect patients .
it 's actually killing our economy , too .
seems you have fallen for what is commonly known as a " logical fallacy ".
__value1__ href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fallacy"> __name1__ - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia </a>
just because a happened , then b happened , that does n't mean that a caused b.
it 's true .
our businesses can n't compete because they have to pay for healthcare for their employees and none of the businesses in the other __quant1__ industrialized nations have to .
we really are a laughingstock .
and according to one of the most liberal leaders in __name1__ , on his very own website .
" and today , __quant1__ __name1__ do not have a family doctor .
__quant1__ patients are on waiting lists for care ".
they are much smaller population wise than us and after almost __quant1__ years under their plan , still has that problem ?
of course he blames it on private clinics which is bs .
<a href="http://www.ndp.ca/platform/healthcare"> hiring more doctors and nurses and renewing health care | ndp </a>
what liberal left wing did you come from that you totally fabricated your own facts and are completely ignorant of the true facts ?
and what makes you think this health care system is n't going to cost you out the ass .
the government does n't have it 's own money and if you want to get your health care for free then somebody else had to pay for it , so i guess that means your on welfare too .
the government is already running __quant1__ health care programs , __name1__ , __name2__ and the va and they have screwed them up so do you think they can run this new healthcare system ?
you 're quite good at the doom and gloom talking points fed you by big pharma , and the right wing politicians that receive $billions from them .
do you have any facts ?
the fact that nobody seems to be able to name just __quant1__ federal program that has ever delivered on its promise and come in anywhere near its budget projections is good enough for me .
maybe you can name it ?
i see .
then how about __name1__ .
__quant1__ years of single payer health care , __value1__ in the world in longevity .
and their average income is one tenth of ours .
seems to me that the fallacy here is that we can afford to go on with the system that we have .
then stfu and move to __name1__ .
my goodness , you and kitten have a thing going .
such a deep thinker .
maybe taking care of __quant1__ people compared to 300 mill ...
might make a slight difference .....
dont talk junky ...
we have seen some of your posts ...

playing " keep up with the jonses " does n't prove jack shit .....

i think that 's what most call " anecdotal evidence ".
if you want __name1__ rican medical care , pack up your ass and gtfo .

fdr has been dead for more than half a century ( and i was n't even born yet ) and i 'm still paying for his foolhardiness .
please try to engage just a few brain cells before you post such pedantic nonsense .
and where the fuck do you propose __name1__ got the funds to build their healthcare system from ?
going from nothing , to having someone else flipping the bill to setup a system for __quant1__ people , is a totally different proposition than trying to pay for __quant2__ people yourself .
pretty ironic that about the time __name1__ rico did this , they abolished the military
i do n't think the vast majority would support that here , even the more die hard liberals i do n't think would , would they ?
you dont have the stones either chris ....
i have seen many of your posts shot down repeatedly ....
yet you keep droning on ....
what fabricated facts ?
every other industrialized nation has a single payer system and they pay half per capita what we pay for healthcare , and they cover everyone .
why ?
because a single payer system is more efficient .
do you also forget that a lot of these countries are smaller in population ?
and __name1__ rico does not even have a military , the others get us to pay for their socialized medical care by proxy since they know we 'll defend their ass so they send less of their gnp on defense and more on infrastructure and other things like healthcare .
this one always cracks me up .
oh ...
we can n't do it because we have too many people !
bullshit .
every other industrialized nation has a single payer healthcare system , and they pay half per capita what we pay for healthcare .
that means that if we used a single payer system , that we would actually be paying less for healthcare than we are paying now because a single payer system is more efficient .
anybody heard of anyone leaving __name1__ to go to __name2__ or __name3__ for a heart transplant or __name4__ treatment ? ?

sorry , but i 'm not falling for your __quant1__ @-@ track pony arguments .

its going to be a huge undertaking to move this many people over .....
listening to you guys your acting like __quant1__ weeks tops and its done .....
not one person including our pres. is talking about the scope of doing something like this , or the problems that will be encountered to get this done .....

meanwhile many are going to get fucked ....
not just that __quant1__ that keeps floating around ...
many who are insured are getting fucked , by thinking they 're covered .
the insurance company screws them in the end , by refusing to pay .
true .
and it 's not like you can take your business elsewhere , not with a pre @-@ existing condition that was refused coverage by ' executive whim ' at __quant1__ of the private bureaucracies .
so much for ' choice '.

__name2__ and its state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art medical establishment is a health care and surgical __name1__ for the world , dontcha know .
sick billionaires the world over rush there to be treated , and we all know hospitals everywhere are clamoring to hire doctors that graduate from __name1__ rican medical schools , and top doctors from every country are fighting to get jobs there ...
in __name1__ leftist bizarro world .
i swear , every liberal in this country must be having __name1__ flashbacks from the sixties , or smoking __name2__ now , or both .
one can n't get treatment in __name1__ unless they have the canadian health card .
i do know of people who have had dental work done in __name1__ .
and why was it that they went all the way to __name1__ for dental care ?
oh , spare me .
you really want us to believe that whole cadres of people out there are getting turned down by their insurance companies for procedures clearly defined in their policies as covered , with no recourse but to suck it up ?
prove it .
on the other hand , it is a known fact in medical billing circles that __name1__ , run by our benevolent government , does not guarantee coverage for any service , and any service rendered to a patient on medicare is being done totally on spec .
they might pay for it when you send in the bill , they probably will , but they do n't promise to , and they can decide not to pay and there 's nothing you can do about it .
by all means , get us all health coverage like that .
pre @-@ existing conditions are n't refused coverage by " whim ", you dimwit .
you do n't buy fire insurance after your house burns down , or car insurance after you get into a fender @-@ bender , and even you would n't be dumb enough to expect the insurance company to go along with that .
only with health insurance are companies expected to force their other customers to cover your misfortune retroactively .
it can be done but please consider what size __name1__ is and also , they have no military , if we did that , we could provide healthcare , we might be speaking __name2__ but we could do it i suppose .
oh , please .
i can n't believe you people are actually accepting the absurd premise that __name1__ actually has better health care than the __name2__ , and arguing as though that nonsense is true , and trying to find ways to explain it away , instead of just horselaughing at it and moving on as it deserves .
you dumbass liberals call me when rich people from around the world flock to __name1__ frigging __name1__ for lifesaving operations the way they do here .
and tell me which airline you 'd be taking there if you were diagnosed with brain __name1__ .
i was stating that the only way they did it was to dissolve the military , silly thing to do in this day and age .
i support a free market approach , get government completly out of the equation .
good point .
did n't __name1__ go to __name2__ in nc for his treatment ?
now why the heck did n't he go to __name1__ ?
i 'll patiently wait for old rocks or chris to explain that .

many people from __name1__ plan for their medical · needs from hip replacement to heart valve replacement to be taken care of · by the well @-@ trained and skillful physicians , in __name2__ , rather than in their · native countries .
clearly then , not only does __name1__ offer universal health care coverage · to its citizens , but that same high quality care is available for people from · all over the world .
__name1__ costa rica health care </a>
let 's see , you quoted my post , yet you completely failed to answer the questions i asked .
here they are again , try again .
glad you brought that up !
in __name1__ the rich get the best healthcare .
is that how healthcare should be rationed ?
yes , only the rich deserve to have their lives saved .
everyone else deserves to die .
is this a great country or what ?
ok , not a problem ;
i get the best health care and i 'm not rich .
you won't get any health care because you 're too much of a lazy parasite to buy insurance .
who is your insurance company ?
ok , not a problem ;
is that srsly your answer , chris ?
it could get a bit crowded if everyone went to __name1__ , would n't it ?
__name1__ has public insurance that pays his medical bills .
no doubt he 's grateful to you for paying his medical bills .
no , actually amanda , that is the question .
should only the rich receive good healthcare ?
look , up in the sky ! !
it 's a bird ...
it 's a plane ...
no , it 's........
again fuckface , i 'm not rich .
and the only reason you wont receive good healthcare is you 're too much of a shit stain to buy insurance .
red herring and denial of actual reality , jackass .
you 're making yourself look foolish .
do you recall in your ' the best healthcare in __name1__ is government run ' thread where you accused me of not reading the linked article then i handed you your ass with quotes from the article ?
i 'm sure you remember because you 've been avoiding responding to me in that thread ever since .
here 's the thing , earlier in that thread i said :
i think everyone in the world should get the very best health care .
you responded by claiming i had n't read the article .
so my question at this point is do you even read the posts you respond to ?
your question , addressed specifically to me : ' should only the rich receive good healthcare ?
' was answered in a post you supposedly read even before you asked the question .
uh @-@ oh ....
looks like the little lady fired up her pwnroller again ! !
amanda is simply emasculating poor little chris today
and i for one am impressed by her ability to find anything at all to remove .
here 's one more for amanda
not at all .
it is the very basis of our for profit healthcare system .
how does the single mother with __name1__ who can n't work pay health insurance permiums ?
if they pass any bill on health care without giving __name1__ the time to read and digest the details , there is gonna be a revolution in this country , and i not so sure it will be a peaceful one .
__quant1__ people in my town showed up in the rain to protest a government run health care system today over the lunch hour .
they offered up private solutions , good ones , ones that do n't increase taxes on anyone .
the people are pissed , 1 st about the no stimulus stimulus bill that was passed before anyone had a chance to read it .
__value1__ nd about the __name1__ bill that had __quant1__ earmarks that __name2__ said he would veto and signed anyway .
__value1__ rd __name1__ that narrowly passed the __name2__ and will be debated in the __name3__ in __month1__
__name1__ are overwhelingly against these bills especially when they find out how much it is going to cost , the national debt and the absolute job killing consequences of __name2__ .
seriously , should they pass national health care without an __name1__ debate i would not want to be one of them .
they will be tarred , feathered and run out of town on a rail .
a message to any __name1__ congressman or senator that is for national health care , make sure you have plenty of security when you show up in your home state .
it 's not going to be the warm welcome you have been used to , it 's gonna be down right ugly .
you are right .
we should abolish __name1__ and the va .
no more government healthcare .
it should be evey man for himself .
and if a single mother gets __name1__ and can n't pay her health insurance permium , that just too bad for her and her kids .
now you 're thinking .
survival of the fittest .
kill off the weak , and shit won't cost so much for the rest of us .
you truely are the heart and soul of the __name1__ .
or you get __name1__ and can n't get care because you 're too much of a shit stain to buy coverage ?
like __value1__ % of your idiotic questions , it does n't deserve an answer for its fatally flawed premise .
not even a good attempt to try and deflect from the fact that your entire thread premise has been eviscerated .
should only the rich receive the best healthcare ?
again , you daft cunt , i 'm not rich and i get great health coverage .
you never did respond to that .
2 . changing the subject
do only the rich deserve the best healthcare ?
did n't change the subject , you daft cunt .
i answered you .
should you stop letting old rocks sodomize you ?
1 . personal insult
should you continue to let old rocks come on your face ?
1 . personal insult
1 . personal insult
should you demand that old rocks give you a reach @-@ around ?
as i suspected you can n't answer the question .
people who can pay should get it.pay your own bills , dont put them one the next generation .
odd , since i have never voted __name1__ in my life .
and if you are a single mother with __quant1__ kids who is hospitalized with __name1__ , how do you " pay your bills "?
1 . personal insult
and if you are a single mother with __quant1__ kids who is hospitalized with __name1__ , how do you " pay your bills ."
nope , we only say that to you , shitstain .
it 's not a big story .
it 's only a big story to racist __name1__ .
after all , the __quant1__ black boys who poured gasoline and set a __quant2__ year old white boy on fire was n't exactly news to __name2__ or __name3__ . black mobs beating up white fair goers at the __name1__ never even got a mention .
if __name1__ does n't go in for race baiting ( and it 's not even race since __name2__ is hispanic ) , good for them .
i agree .
if the dead teen had been white this story would n't be a blip on anyones radar .
typical race baiting .
i did see a good segment on __name1__ yesterday on it though .
so it is getting coverage .
hell the local news down here in __name1__ was full of it the other day .
natalee holloway disagrees with you .
so does __name1__ and __name2__ , who covered it ad nauseum :
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=natalee+holloway+greta&oq=natalee+holloway+greta&aq=f&aqi=&aql=&gs_l=youtube.3...5413l10746l0l11627l7l7l0l0l0l0l77l482l7l7l0"> natalee holloway __name1__ - youtube </a> .
but that 's different ....
somehow .
what about the black teens who chased and beat white fairgoers in __name1__ .
the media did n't touch this story .
this was a huuuge event .
for no apparent reason a group of black teenagers systematically started chasing and hitting white people .
nothing in the media .
a group of blacks dressed in uniform and carrying clubs outside a voting precinct and the racist __name1__ excused it .
i would have loved to see what would have happened if a group of white racist dressed in __name1__ militaristic garb carrying clubs outside a voting precinct would have resulted in the media ....
it would have been headline news for weeks .
or imagine a group of white teens attacking blacks coming out of a church or other gathering ....
a nuclear bomb could go off and you would n't have known it for the wall to wall coverage .
both the media and __name1__ act in overt racism on a regular basis and then we have people like marcatl trying to point the finger the other direction .
what a tool .
all those stories were covered both in print and on television .
yes local television .
it 's the biggest , hottest news story in media .
are they not a media company interesting in keeping the populate updated on the latest and greatest and hottest news ?
any of you wager to guess why such little coverage for the biggest , most powerful media organization on the world ?
__name1__ is covering it .
all day yesterday and today .
because they 're not part of the state run media , they are not an extension of the __name1__ re @-@ election campaign .
thus , they were n't given orders to run the same race bait story over and over to stir up racial divisions more .
thats exactly what the hussein wants , he wants the chaos , he wants the outrage to be rampant throughout society , and the main stream media is happy to oblige .
killings that are investigated are big news(.)
not
true..
__name1__ is state run media .
but it 's not part of anything __name1__ is doing .
the __name1__ run __name2__ .
so , owning a __value1__ % share of a company means they ' run ' fox ....
is that your assertion ?
seriously ?
sometimes , swallow , you take stupid to an rdean level .
how can you not be embarrassed by that ?
link ?
or did you pull that out of your ass ?
shareholders
in __month1__ __year1__ the __name1__ family owned only about __value1__ % of the company .
however , nearly all of these shares were voting shares , and __name1__ retained effective control of the company .
nonetheless , __name1__ of __name2__ had built up a large stake , with about half of the shares being voting shares .
therefore , in __month1__ __year1__ , __name1__ announced its intention to transfer its __value1__ per cent managing interest in directv group to __name3__ 's __name2__ ; in return it bought back liberty 's __value2__ % shares in news corp . , giving __name4__ tighter control of the latter firm .
[ 33 ] __name1__ sold __quant1__ class a shares in __month1__ __year1__ .
[ 34 ] · prince __name1__ @-@ __name1__ of __name2__ , through his __name4__ company , owns __value1__ % of __name3__ corp .' s shares , making kingdom holdings the __value2__ largest shareholder .
[ 35][36][37 ] · __quant1__ after when __name2__ was absorbed in __year1__ , __name1__ owned half of the re @-@ issues from the record label company .
__name1__ news __name2__ - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia </a>
for the record , it is a saudi , not ' the saudis '.
i think the story is on every media outlet .
maybe they were all at a klan rally .
no , it was a pretty light turnout .
i was n't talking about the story .
i was simply responding to bullshit from idiots with a single fact .
' the __name1__ ' do not ' own ' or ' run ' __name2__ .
__quant1__ __name1__ owns __value1__ % of shares in the company .
i am bored with left wing hacks lying about this crap .
what 's really sad is the left wing crazies around here , lead by marcatl , who are using the tragic murder of that young kid in __name1__ to bash __name2__ .
and out and out lying about the coverage too , __name1__ has been talking about it for the better part of __quant1__ minutes , and they 've covering it all day .
you guys have absolutely no creditability at all .
it marc was white and starting thread after thread defending __name1__ , he 'd be called a racist .
and for good reason , in my opinion .
marc is a racist .
sad but true .
oh wowza ...
__name1__ talked about it for a whopping __quant1__ minutes .
big whoop !
i 'd still need to see a link to believe that tripe .
how do you know marc is not white ?
( oh , and for the record , i am not a roasted turkey with an eerie resemblance to __name1__ )
he 's not , if i am to believe what he has told me in the past .
in fact , i believe he is of __name1__ descent .
he can correct me , of course .
all in all , marc can be a dick at times and i certainly let him know when he is .
but , i do respect his passion for equal rights .
he 's ok by me .
i think a lot of folks need to reign in their emotions more and look objectively at situations , but then not everyone can be as wonderful as i am .
*joke*
( and , thank goodness they are n't .
life would be very boring for me .)
as i said , asswipe , he covered it for quite some time , i 'd say for __quant1__ minutes at a minimum .
and the other news anchors covered it earlier in the day and you 'll see it later too .
the truth is you do n't believe it cuz you do n't wanna believe it .
and that 's fine , your entitled to whatever you wanna think .
but do n't be pretending you want a serious conversation minus any bias , cuz you can n't offer the same .
why do n't you tune into __name1__ dipshit , and see for yourself ?
might i suggest the lead story at or near the top of every fucking hour until __name1__ shows up ?
i 'm going to watch all the __name1__ shows tonight like a hawk .
from what __quant1__ 've seen thus far , they 've been __quant1__ day late and a dollar short .
tepid and very light coverage when they did cover it ...
spinning it more like it 's an opportunity for the left to grab their __value1__ amendment rights away from them .
better you than me .
marcatl : taking one for the team !
maybe they just report the facts and do n't waste time creating faux outrage without some legally sound facts to back it up ?
maybe they do n't want to whip up hatred for the sake of ratings ?
maybe they do n't like race baiting ?
wipe your chin , marc , you 're drooling again .
ok , lay off the sauce .
this is __name1__ we 're talking about .
they whip up __name1__ hatred on __quant1__ , sometimes __quant2__ , basis .
even their website stokes fear and hatred of __name1__ :
earlier , it had a story about __name1__ 's trip to __name2__ this morning to announce the pipeline construction , and their headline was " obama 's pipe dream ".
they are just not honest actors .
everyone knows that californagurl is the biggest , lyingest , boozing whino on the interwebs .
you can smell the booze coming out of her pores __quant1__ mile a way .
she stinks to high @-@ heaven of it .
do n't you see how she 's always running off at the mouth spewing total nonsensical swill ?
i knew that cg was ditzy , but i did n't know she was tipsy !
remember the __quant1__ years of __name1__ 's presidential campaign ?
well i watched __name1__ __quant3__ for like __quant1__ - __quant2__ of those months straight ...
i mean every show .
it finally got to be too much , the hatred , the race @-@ baiting , the racism , the outright lies ...
i fled and have n't turned back since .
__name1__ 's the worst , he 's like the __name2__ version of californagurl ...
he just lies so stinkin much .
and , that 's what i mean about reigning in emotions .
you 're mad at her and you 're saying stuff that everyone knows you have no first hand knowledge of it .
sorta cringeworthy , i say .
only a rampant drunkard and raging alcoholic could spew the swill she does on __quant1__ and consistant basis .
__name1__ has concluded __name2__ is n't white and many questions remain :
__name2__ __value1__ martin __value1__ race __value1__ a __value1__ __name1__ though __value1__ not white ? </a>
<a __name1__ news latino </a>
i just turned to the __name1__ in time to hear the panel discussing __name2__ 's birth certificate .
the __name1__ tv babe was just finishing up a tirade about __name2__ 's birth certificate ! !
no sooner did i post about it than the __name1__ manifest their nonsense .
that has got to be some kind of record .
naw..
no swallow for you sandy..
are n't the construction workers near __name1__ enough for you ?
you still haul them two by two into the phone booths ?
man..
your quick .
ratings are important , subject matter is not .
wrong ! !!!.....
__name1__ is playing right now .
regardless , what she said stands .
a single person 's __value1__ % interest in an entity does not equate to it being state run .
well , at least in this dimension .
mad can be motivating , but being in an extended state of anger does not foster rational thought .
thank you for the link .
but that info is from __year1__ , best i can tell .
he may own more now .
or less .
but i doubt that he would sell any .
it 's not like he needs the money .
a single share holder with __value1__ % of the stock..
is pretty huge .
in any case..
the other guy , __name1__ , is in deep shit in sandy 's native country of __name2__ for spying on private citizens .
wonder how much of __name1__ 's spunk gets on her chin after he 's done ?
__name1__ is easy enough to update - should the share percentage have changed , i 'm sure it would have been included .
the fact remains , you got shown to be a petty moronic whiner who clearly does not bother to fact check information .
i do .
which is why __quant1__ know that it is __quant1__ __name1__ , not ' the saudis '...
and it is a mere __value1__ % - hardly a controlling interest .
so , how come you 're not accusing sallow of ' pulling ' information ' out of his ass '?
because he 's a liberal .
unlike myself .
i 'm a conservative , therefore you challenge my information .
you are a dishonest and mindless hack ...
and a mindnumbingly boring poster .
lol - really ?
- they 're still talking about his birth certificate in __month1__ __year1__ ?
that is too funny .
i do n't have cable .
i miss out on so much !
wrong ! !!!.....
i 'm also calm as heck ...
and cool as a muddahush @-@ yo @-@ mouf ! !
boy i remember about __quant1__ years and change ago when you and your types were all pro anger with the whole tea @-@ bagger movement and all .
remember dem days ?
he 's already had input in the propaganda __name1__ spews..
__name1__ bin talal - sourcewatch </a>
now they 're disccusing the __name1__ autopsy ruling of an accidental drowning ...
seems to be what this whole segment will be about .
you 're quoting a left wing propaganda site as a legitimate source ?
__value1__ % shareholder .....
and you 're seriously gonna continue to pretend he ' runs ' __name1__ ?
even an idiot can see the numbers do n't add up .
i despise willful stupidity .
pathetic spinning and whining instead of using basic logic ...
you 're making yourself look ridiculous .
even a hyper @-@ partisan dunce like yourself should realize that although normally 7 is a low number in percentage , in ownership of companies such as __name1__ it reflects a large percentage of influence .
from your own quote earlier , he 's the __value1__ largest shareholder .
snap out of your partisan stupor and smell the roses .
he got __name1__ to scrub any references to __name2__ cash backing __name3__ .
heck..
even __name1__ scrubbed the __name2__ from the __name3__ @/@ __name3__ commission report .
__name1__ are the puppet masters of __name2__ conservatives .
and , the influence that it shows happened is that the __name1__ 's request to change the description of a protest as a __name2__ one to a civil one was only done after it was confirmed that it was not just __name2__ .
oh , the horror of such influence .
no he did n't .
making more shit up .
it 's on every single last show i 've watched you lying race baiting maggot .
which is pretty much the same as any other influential group trying to influence media ...
say , like the __name1__ organizing email campaigns to sponsors of right wing talk show hosts .
influence ...
people have it , people use it .
i see nothing of import in that .
of course , i 'm not an hysterical lying race baiter .
yes , it is .
and , this thread is so very childish .
it reminds me of when i was a child and my little brother would complain that someone else 's cookie was microscopically larger than his .
we usually traded with him to stop the incessant whining about such non @-@ consequential minutia .
no , only a bit too much influence with __name1__ .
the __name1__ has ignored __name2__ human abuses for __quant1__ ; oil is the reason .
right .
rarely are retractions made without someone telling the organization that they are wrong .
such influence !
the horror !
they must be state run , too .
__name2__ is owned by __name1__ .
__name1__ is __name2__ .
thus __name1__ is state run .
lol ! !!
too funny !
hi , you have received -@ __quant1__ reputation points from two thumbs .
reputation was given for <a href="http://www.usmessageboard.com/media/214372-why-is-foxnews-giving-the-trayvon-martin-story-little-to-no-coverage.html#post4998204"> this </a> post .
comment : · for being a lying race baiting maggot .
regards , · two thumbs
note : this is an automated message .
you should just give up expecting honesty or rational thought from swallow .
he 's lost the last remaining thread linking him to reality long ago .
now i owe you __quant1__ negs for whining .
gotta spread it around .
naw..
the __name1__ have been financing terrorism against the __name2__ for ages .
the reason ?
they wanted the __name1__ to go after their enemies..
like __name1__ .
__name1__ omar __value1__ @-@ __name2__ - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia </a>
we got played .
like fiddles .
it 's funny that a far left whack is a racist ?
mm , ok .
i guess as long as your happy being a racist , do carry on .
again sandy..
no swallow .
but here 's a consolation prize .
i hear soap might be good for cleaning the crabs out of a sandy vage .
try it some time .
that brit thing of going " au natural " really stinks .
maybe shave those pits too .
it 's hard to follow such ' logic ' as is being used by some in this thread .
mindless race baiting is beneath our intellectual levels , i suspect .
that is our mutual cross to bear .
i hear soap might be could for cleaning the crabs out of a sandy vage .
lame .
regardless of what you think about her person , your claim that __name1__ is state run is stupid .
seriously stupid , and not based in any reality .
likewise .
much of its whining is stupid ...
it apparently can n't tell the difference between ' media ' and the ' flame zone '.
one wonders how it manages to survive in the real world ...
but it does go some way to explaining it 's lack of employment .
__name1__ ain't news..
si .
and __name1__ is next on the __name2__ hit list .
you watch __name1__ .
tell me what they think of hitting iran..
__name1__ saudi __name2__ urges us __name3__ on iran to stop nuclear __value1__ | world __name4__ the guardian </a>
__name1__ ain't news..
only , i do n't watch __name1__ .
and , i agree that __name1__ 's nuclear program is a danger .
i 've thought so for many , many years now .
and , i would bet good money that if the __name3__ did strike __name4__ , you would blame __name1__ and so would __name2__ - he has yet to accept responsibility for anything .
because they know their audience .
__name1__ ain't news..
yeah..
and the last __name1__ target had nukes too..
right ?
i sure as hell know __name1__ has no civil rights complaint .
kid gloves for a guy who just shot someone else to death .
even police have to take time off work , not zimmerman , he 's suddenly the victim .
who said __name1__ is a victim ?
other than you , of course .
just watched __name1__ .
he had on an older heavy set white guy who apparently was the author of the law .
the guy who wrote it said this law does not apply .
then __name1__ went on about a young teen who bought __name2__ from a __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ and while unarmed , was walking back to his father while he was followed by an armed man who police told to stop following the kid .
the young teen is now dead and the killer is still walking around armed .
i know .
it was really weird to see such a thing on __name1__ .
maybe because it 's coming from their token gay .
or ....
maybe it 's because those are the established facts of this gutwrenchingly sad situation ?
twit .
i 'm watching him now .
i was watching the __name1__ show previously , but i 'm now back on my foxwatch .
__quant1__ things here :
1 - i thought that in the past , you laughed at wiki being used as a source .
2 - i thought that in the past , you have claimed not to be a conservative , but an independent .
discussing his injuries , how the killing " went down " indicates the killer is now the victim .
everything 's fair game on a public board .
if she wanted it to be truly " her business " she would have not been a member of this particular website .
too much of the the " fair game " trash got a young man killed .
this one i have to disagree with you adamantly on .
what got that young man killed was racist views and a demented man with a chip on his shoulder .
that is an opinion , it is not established as fact .
the __name1__ heavily pushed the __name2__ bill which __name3__ signed .
i think __name1__ wants to stay on good terms w/ the __name2__
__value1__ href="http://mediamatters.org/blog/201203220019"> http://mediamatters.org/blog/201203220019 </a>
__name1__ : the __name2__ lobbyist behind __name4__ 's __name3__ legislation
i do n't value wiki that highly as a source ....
simply because it is open to biased editing and has , on many occasions , been factually inaccurate .
i am independent ....
in that i have no allegiance to any political party ...
i am certainly a fiscal conservative ...
socially , not so much .
that 's being independent .
twit .
fact remains ....
and you can research this for yourself ...
__quant1__ __name1__ currently owns __value1__ % of shares in news corp. note : __name2__ as a whole , not fox news .
anyone who claims otherwise is a lying twit .
an opinion addressing another opinion .
so what ... ?
if this is a passive aggressive swipe at me , then i ask you to read up on brother minister __name1__ @-@ __name1__ , because clearly you 're sadly and severely mistaken .
however , if it was not to me , then my sincerest apologies .
__name1__ inspires hatred ?
how ?
that question is directed to techieny ...
right ?
yes atl .
it is not a big news story .
you just want to make a race case .
there are whites killed all the time in the inner city !
i watch __name1__ __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ hours __quant3__ , an it appears to me that story is getting as much coverage as any other including that of the terrorist in __name2__ .
you , marc , do n't know that of which you post .
btw it 's not a white on black crime ; the shooter is __name1__ and has blacks in his immediate family .
this one is trying hard , but can n't seem to spin and twist herself out of a wet paper bag to save her partisan life .
lol ! !
really ?
he 's a victim to you .
who knew ?
interesting , since you just used wiki as a source , but just a few months ago said this about wiki :
seriously , you 're citing ' wiki ' as the absolute authority ?
you do know that it 's not a source for unbiased , strictly fact based information , right ?
i love busting you with your own words .
not ' busting ' at all .
i do n't rate wiki , for the reasons i cited previously ...
it is too easy to abuse the editing system .
yet you run to wiki when it 's conveniet .
as i already stated .
however , they are right ...
it is a __value1__ % share .
how do you know this , if wiki is unreliable , as you claim ?
and , i know that other people find wiki acceptable ...
so i go with it ....
" other people " find __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ acceptable - do you use those , also ?
if you ever have , then link up !
you have n't .
you won't .
you can n't .
you can wiggle and whine as much as you like but i proved the statement of ' the saudis run __name1__ ' to be utter bullshit .
that is why you 're pissed .
you 're confusing me with another poster .
because you 're confused .
and busted !
but ...
i am entertained that you trawled the site in a desperate need to ' prove ' something that i would happily have conceded - had you just asked .
idiot .
no need - i save definitive statements from wingnuts for just these situations .
oh snap .
the __name1__ has stopped covering the __name2__ story .
he is now back to __name1__ ball licking .
yet you are quick to use it when it backs up your contention , right ?
that 's dishonest .
you are ?
but you just claimed that you were a conservative .
not " i am fiscally conservative ", or " i have some things in common with conservatives " - you said " i 'm a conservative ".
that 's also dishonest .
busted !
you 're beginning to sound like a __quant1__ year old , sythia .
if you find me so hard to handle , do n't deal with me .
you 're limited intellect must struggle with anyone who is open minded and rational ....
i know those concepts are alien to you .
stupid boy .
you 're the gift that keeps on giving !
synthia , here is an easy rule of thumb for anyone with respect to using wiki as a source :
sure , go to __name1__ , that 's fine .
if you find the info there that you need , check to see if it 's cited to a separate source .
if it is , check the source .
if that is good , use it .
easy .
and the __value1__ % is cited , thrice :
35 .
__name1__ 's son sees pay doubled ahead of exit , __name2__ , __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ .

__name1__ interview with prince __name2__ , __value1__ · 37 .
li , kenneth ( __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ ) .
" __name1__ backs __name2__ ".
__name1__ ( __name2__ ) .
retrieved __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ .
seems solid to me .
oh boy , oh boy , oh boy ! !!
i got some sweet quotes from __name1__
this stinks to high heaven , and the way the police handled this , stinks to high heaven ...
this looks like a terrible situation ...
as far as __value1__ @-@ degree murder , that charge looks very promising for the d.a...
the __name1__ law , that 's not what this case is about .
even the guy who authored the law has said , " my law does n't apply here..."
that does not apply when i go over to you , i create the circumstances of a confrontation , then you start using force against me , i can n't then use that law to use deadly force against you .
it 's written right into the law that you can n't use that law in those circumstances .
exactly what myself , and others , have been saying about the matter from the very beginning .
__name1__ 's toast ...
toast i say .
its because their demographic thinks the shooter did the right thing .
you see , they are a bunch of morons .
its so simple really .
i believe you 're spot on .
you can bet your bottom dollar on that .
the black dude would have been in jail the second the cops arrived on the scene .
it would have never even gotten to the point where the foxnews would have had to setup their communications center there .
excellent points zoom .
i 'm watching that very part of mj right now , i tape it __quant1__ so i can watch it later .
well , looks like black kid hunter __name1__ finally got what he always wanted , a kill under his belt .
i hope he 's happy w/himself .
i 'm not seeing any justification for the title of this thread .
this story is very active on __name1__ .
i 'm also glad that __name1__ seems to be a thorn in your side .
riiiiiiiiiiiiight .... !!!
i think we have very different standards of ' knowledge ', dweebie .
some of us go with fact , you prefer fiction .
generally , i do n't rely on __name1__ as a solid sole source for ' research '.
but then , i am academically minded ...
it appears that , though you claim to value education - we must have very different understandings of what the word ' education ' means also .
twit .
does your so @-@ called intelligence cause you to hurl so many senseless insults there skippy ?
since you seem to support mindless violence without the effort of due process , i view you as a race baiting asshole who cares more about creating hatred than promoting justice .
i do n't engage with mindless ' hate ' and those who promote violence as an answer when they do n't get their way .
child .
so far the worst of the race baiters have been unable to come up with anything that says __name1__ shot __name2__ because he was black .
not __quant1__ thing .
you honestly think that did n't play into it katz ?
nope .
not a single thing .
for __quant1__ thing , this area is majority black .
if __name1__ was going to target blacks , he 'd be doing it every day all day .
if he was a racist , he would n't be living there in the __value1__ place .
there would be a long history of expressed racism .
there is n't .
the only act that the race baiters have is that treyvon williams is black .
__name1__ is hispanic , but but for purposes of accusation he 's white .
the area is majority black ?
i read somewhere it was like a little over __value1__ % black , does anyone have a link for this ?
__name1__ can n't find a way to blame __name2__ .
once they discover that smoking gun , they 'll be on it .
the beady eyed one is a good lister .
the homosapien , barely , has a knack for listing off things that bash __name1__ and his administration .
i 'm sure the lapdogs and lemmings just lick it up , off the ground and all .
he just prattled off a list of things @/@ people that __name1__ blames for the gas prices .
i 've seen him do lists of all sorts of things like this .
what a putz .
he must be doing something right ...
#1 , he 's pissing you off and #2 , he 's doing a lot better that rachel madcow in the ratings .
so i guess you 're double pissed .
he 's doing a lot worse in influence , and he 's a total failure in facts .
how , precisely , does ' everyone know that '?
you create your own reality if that makes your life easier .
i shall remain in the real one , where i cope exceptionally well .
this is the wrong thread for this .
but what i do n't understand is how you can have such a strong opinion and know nothing ?
look , do a search using the phrase , " prince __name1__ protects __name2__ against hostile takeover bids " and then pick which source you want to " learn from ", because deary , you really need to learn .
__name1__ only owns __value1__ % of __name2__ a hostile bid is a lot easier going against __value2__ % then __value3__ % .
and while you 're at it , find out why __name1__ is investing in the prince 's __name2__ network .
i love that you sign all of your posts !
it gives them that ' personal touch '.
he only called him a " fucking coon " on the 911 call , but that 's not racial , is it ?
i see that i just walked in on a __name1__ meeting .
you and the other race @-@ baiters are trying to prove that with __name1__ not covering __name2__ ( they are though ) , its viewers must be racist .
the problem is , __name1__ has been covering the story and even the lw mouthpiece __name2__ has been covering other stories .
you see , their viewers do not want the network to get off the " bash the repubs and kiss __name1__ 's ass " format .
how 's that for giving a damn about this kid ?
your statment , " its because their demographic thinks the shooter did the right thing " is total bullshit as evidenced by the majority of the thousands of postings on this matter .
all but the most eff 'd up people , regardless of ideology , feel that this was a bad shooting and __name1__ must pay for what he did .
there are many facts that have not come out yet and due process must be allowed to play out .
yeah , and on __name1__ on __name2__ , this fucking idiot said perhaps the shooting was an accident .
seriously , he fucking said this .
the other __name1__ members at __name2__ said he was killed because he was wearing a hoodie , so its his fault .
fucking __name1__ and __name1__ fans are beyond belief .
they really are and i am speaking to you directly .
academically minded ?
really ?
you sit in front of __quant1__ of mankind 's greatest inventions .
a method to find out information from anywhere in the world in seconds .
from millions of different sources .
with pictures and video .
yet , you call what you learn " fiction " and feel it 's " stupid ".
yet , there you are , pounding out nothing of value .
but i get it .
i really do .
in the " binary " world of the right wing , it 's either all lies or all gospel truth .
there is no in @-@ between .
but there is " outside the box ", which is where you are .
we call that space " batshit crazy ".
i keep telling you not to read those prophecy sites rdean , you are getting confused .
i just learned that today was the __value1__ day __name1__ said anything about the __name2__ story .
today .
interesting .
and __name1__ is covering this story .
they 're just not in a race @-@ baiting feeding frenzy like the liberal press is .
they 're actually being responsible journalists .
as more evidence comes out , they will cover the story a bit more .
then why did __name1__ say the shooting was an accident ?
why did __name1__ say it was the victims fault because he wore a hoodie ?
please explain this ?
i actually listened to __name1__ 's radio show today and he said nothing of the sort .
in fact he is all for getting to the bottom of this as quickly as possible ...
your assertion that __name1__ is soft on this is way off bud ...
way off .
either you 're a liar , ignorant of recent history , willfully ignorant , or a pathetic combination of all three .
every situation that you mention was covered by the press ( tv , radio , print ) ....
a simple __name1__ search will confirm what i say .
what you did n't have in those cases were a police force that did a piss poor job of investigating a fatal shooting and a __name2__ local law that gave creeps like __name1__ ( with a record of being a 911 nusiance to the police and a criminal record ) credence to do what he did .
and then you had this <a __value1__ call __value1__ __name1__ __value1__ __name2__ __value1__ a ' __value1__ coon '? </a>
<a __name1__ young __name2__ cenk __name3__ current tv </a>
__name2__ noise resident idiot __name1__ try to play it all off as a " mistake "......
yeah , after the 911 tape clearly has the cops telling __name1__ that he does not have to follow __name2__ , and __name1__ making all types of wild assumptions while observing a man in the rain at night !
so " hispanics " do not racially discriminate ?
puh @-@ leeze !
__name1__ said that ?
really ?
that was __name1__ , who , i am pretty sure , is a complete idiot , and a liberal .
the __quant1__ self professed new black panthers that stood outside a polling station were investigated by the cops and it was found that they did not threaten or intimidate anyone nor did they belong to any true organization .
had __name1__ @-@ nazis @/@ aryans showed up in a group as you say , then that would have made news because those boys make it known they do n't like black folk .
the pseudo @-@ panthers claimed they were there to prevent a re @-@ enactment of the nonsense that went on in __name1__ in __year1__ .
and all one has to do is a simple __name1__ search to see that the __name2__ incident was covered by tv , radio and print .
so either you are poor liar or incredibly ignorant as to what 's going on around you .
what you had __value1__ __name1__ with __value1__ was __value1__ tape like this <a __value1__ call __value1__ __name2__ __value1__ a ' __value1__ coon '? </a>
a guy with a criminal record being told by the cops he does n't have to follow the man , cops who do a piss poor job of crime scene investigation , the parents trying for __quant1__ days to find out what happened to their kid , and a law that encourages assholes like __name1__ .
it 's a perfect storm that subliminal sheet wearers like you do n't like .
tfb .
facts are not important
the __name1__ questions and covers the authenticity of president __name2__ 's presidency , citizenship and religion 1000 times more than they cover the __name3__ killing .
you really need to learn to differentiate between ' news ' and ' comment '.
a substantial amount of __name1__ 's programming is dedicated to comment programs .
currently , with this particular issue , there is nothing for commentators to really be discussing ...
other than to indulge in race baiting - like you are .
their news coverage has covered it ...
in sufficient detail as is available .
the hysterical bullshit and speculation that you indulge in has no place in a ' news ' program .
now , try and use the limited intellect you possess to think logically and dispassionately - without regard to the victim 's race about how much solid factually accurate information there is about this case ...
__quant1__ minutes would seem generous to me .
oh spare us all this nonsense you keep pulling out of your ass .
deal with reality :
__name2__ fox news coverage __name3__ trayvon martin case __name1__ daily beast </a>
if what you said made sense , i could have a reply .
but how can you reply to " batshit crazy "?
you do n't remember this post ?
here is what comes up when i google that phrase .
<a href="http://bibleprophecytracker.blogspot.com/2011_10_01_archive.html"> bible prophecy __month1__ __year1__ october 2011 </a>
you reading __name1__ prophecy conspiracy sites again ?
because they 're not shameful liberal media race @-@ baiters .
they leave that pathetic shite to __name1__ & __name2__ . they still calling __name3__ ' white ?
' keep us updated .
a __name1__ shooting a black kid is the " biggest , most powerful " news story ?
how many __name1__ died in __quant1__ of __name2__ 's wars today ?
put a hoodie on and shut the fuck up , asswipe .
in response to the op ......
do n't worry , bsnbc is pimping the story like a cheap whore
maybe it 's because __name1__ has the good sense to not go all half cocked before anyone knows what the facts are .
who in the media 's been going " half @-@ cocked " and how did they do it ?
every single person who is assuming __name1__ should be in jail just because the kid he shot was black .
come to think of it , that would include you , which might explain why you do n't see it .
the police report indicated that __name1__ had a cut on his head , the girlfriend said she heard some type of struggle over the phone before the shots , and there is even a witness that claims he saw that fight .
all of that proves that __name1__ told the police the truth .
what the police have to find out now is if __name1__ instigated the confrontation .
if he did , he should face charges .
if he was just following him to make sure he did n't break into a house somewhere in the neighborhood , and __name1__ actually initiated , and escalated , the confrontation , he should n't .
until i know the facts i won't make a decision .
the " fight " was a result of __name1__ purposefully confronting __name2__ with his prejudice ideals ....
ideals recorded on the 911 tape .
wtf are you babbling about ?
do you truly understand who created the term " hispanic " and what it entails , you libertarian lunkhead ?
and as the 911 tapes shows , it was n't " liberals " that brought race into the issue , but __name1__ himself !
get your head out of __name1__ 's ass , will ya please .
racist .
just as i thought ....
another libertarian lunkhead parroting the neocon @/@ teabagger rhetoric ...
and when confronted , you got nothing ( here 's where this libertarian lunkhead excerpts part of my response in an " i know you are , but what am i " retort ) .
why do you hate __name1__ so much ?
in __name2__ we have a thing called __name1__ .
we do not approve of lynch @-@ mobs .
i know that bothers you socialists/progressives , but that 's the way it is .
so get over it .
the more it looks like __name1__ acted in self defense , the less you will hear of this case .
nah , you 're just an average bigot .
__quant1__ can spot em __quant1__ mile away .
are you just being a stupid crank with this neocon @/@ teabagger bs ?
or are you truly just another libertarian lunkhead parroting your neocon @/@ teabagger cousin 's stupidity ?
hey genius , " due process " includes proper police procedure ....
that means you do not just let a man involved in a fatal shooting go scott free without so much as taking them to a precinct for questioning , drug @/@ alcohol test .
the call for justice is a call for __name1__ to be arrested , not " lynched ".
intellectually dishonest libertarians/neocons/teabaggers are quick to distort and misrepresent anything that does not fit into your warped version of life ....
but the facts will always be your undoing .
carry on .
__name1__ on __name2__ , their chief political correspondent , this am asked gov __name3__ of __name4__ why it " took more than __quant1__ month to react ? "
today is sunday the __day1__ th of __month1__ and the shooting took place on __weekday1__ __month2__ __day2__ th .
that 's __quant2__ days ago which is now exactly __quant1__ month ago , and the gov appointed a special prosecutor and a task force to investigate on the __value1__ nd .
so why was n't she able to report this factually , and based on that why should we believe her reporting ?
those idiots can only think of __quant1__ answer to the question because anything else would spoinl their attempt to make this a race issue .
the reason that it took so long is that the __name1__ police investigated the incident and determined that __name2__ 's story checked out and they released him .
that should have been it but the parents of the boy were n't satisfied and then only because __name1__ is black and they thought __name2__ was white , did it become a major story .
now that it is , gov.scott is placating the hysterical lynch mob by having someone look into it .
the fact that after all that , __name1__ is still a free man today makes me suspect that zimmerman 's story still checks out .
mind you , it is only speculation on my part .
please stop treating your supposition and conjecture as fact .
it took the parent of __name1__ __quant1__ days before they got the word from the local police dept . as to what happened to their missing kid .
__name1__ was never taken down to a precinct for an official questioning despite being involved in a fatal shooting .
he still has n't to this day .
no decent foresnics .
wtf is that all about ?
if it were not for the due diligence of local black media ( and then national black media ) along with progressive radio stations , the main stream media would have kept this story on the back burner ....
hell , __name1__ was still the __value1__ to catch on with coverage after the __name2__ 3 started coverage .
gov. __name1__ is involved because of the pressure brought by the various groups and the ( now ) national media examination .
try dealing with the facts instead of your wishful thinking .
__name1__ was taken into custody , and released after the police determined they had no probable cause .
as for the forensics , do you think the world works like csi ?
most of the crap they show is impossible half the rest is junk science , and half of the real stuff they show won't hold up in court .
most police departments can n't do a fraction of the forensics that actually exists , so the police screwing it up is not part of some massive conspiracy .
why do n't you start dealing with the facts before you try lecturing others .
the only person in this process whose due process rights are a concern are __name1__ 's , are you trying to argue the police are railroading him ?
if not , stop talking about due process .
you do n't believe in due process ?
man , you socialists @/@ progressives really are lost .
maybe __name1__ is n't the place for you ?
may i suggest __name1__ or __name2__ ?
bon voyage .
due process begins with proper police procedure , you stupe .
as it 's evident , the cops in that area did n't even do that !
a matter of history , a matter of fact that ...
which now requires scrutiny by other forces ( state and possibly federal ) .
but do continue to babble like a good little neocon/teabagger/libertarian flunkie ....
it would be funny if it were n't so pathetic .
you 're dumb .
seriously , it 's true .
really ?
prove it !
because to date he was not given a blood alcohol test , foresnics as to the ballistics from his gun , nor was the __value1__ tape brought into question as to why did he pursue and confront __name1__ when he told not to .
so beyond a quick q&a , what the hell happened ?
was his gun even confiscated ?
( and how the hell does a guy with a record get a ccwp ? )
who said anything about the csi program , genius .
standard ballistic test to determine powder residue on victims and perps hands has been around for a long time , and is available to even the most remote precinct/station .
if they do n't have it on the premises , they can send it to a regional one that does .....
and remember , it 's was over __quant1__ month before the " main stream media " picked this up , which is more than enough time for proper police work to have taken place .
why do n't you start thinking beyond the talking points that make you feel good ?
aw , liberal cretins are just pissed because __name2__ is actually __name1__ .
it kinda throws a wrench in their ' evil __name1__ kills __name2__ kid ' race @-@ baiting hysteria .
liberal media outlets like __name1__ & __name2__ are absolutely befuddled as to how to proceed .
first they called him ' __name1__ ' and indicted the entire white race .
but now they 're backpedaling and have become distraught .
the liberal media is a joke .
period , end of story .
i am babbling about the facts , something that is strange to you .
sorry , but your history on these threads demonstrate time and again what a quantum neocon gasbag you are .
let 's see if you can do better here .
the tape did not record his ideals , he did n't enunciate them to the operator .
i have listened to the tapes , and the only slur it is possible to get out of the tape is ambiguous .
even if he said it , and was actually referring to __name2__ , it does n't say anything about __name1__ 's ideals , it might .
however , be indicative of state of mind .
are you fucking stupid or just insipidly stubborn ?
here gasbag , bs & deny this :
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgr7gcxxqyg"> actual uncut audio ! !! __name2__ href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kgr7gcxxqyg"> __name3__ __value1__ trayvon __name1__ 911 - youtube </a>
__name1__ makes all types of assumptions that do n't coincide with additional information .
given his history of calls on " suspicious " black males that did not pan out , his state of mind is pretty evident ....
and he did not have to pursue __name1__ .
what matters is who started the fight , not why it started .
if __name1__ turned around and called __name2__ a honky and __name2__ attacked him zimmerman over reacted .
if __name1__ attacked __name2__ because he was being followed , he over reacted .
simple statements of fact ,
you 're simple if you think your supposition and conjecture will pass the muster .
__name1__ initiated the confrontation , as the tape clearly tells that he pursued __name2__ when it was not necessary or prompted by the cops .
referring to __name1__ as an " asshole " and a " fucking ( coon ? )"
along with his generalize assumptions gives a clear indication of his mindset , whether you like it or not .
are you really this fucking dense or are you just being obstinate ?
due process means exactly that .....
the process of investingation before any charges are actually being done .
you shoot someone in a public area when there is serious question as to motive and cause , you should be arrested and taken in for questioning , drug testing , foresnics , etc.
deal with it .
thanks for proving my point , pauly .
have the last word , if it makes you feel better .
you 're dismissed !
ok .
you 're also an angry bigot .
see ya .
pauly is still babbling in his ignorance regarding the true origin and definition of the word " hispanic ".
__name1__ 's own history of calls to the cops and the following set his mindset regarding racial prejudice
pauly is just another stupid libertarian/neocon/teabagger crank .
ignore him .
my brother , i implore you , do not engage with circus barkers ...
for you just stoop to their deplorable level .
they are to be laughed at or pitied from afar , but certainly not fed .
racist .
hey the __name1__ watchers and defenders .
have the __name1__ covered the latest news in the case ...
the video which shows that the killer , __name1__ does n't appear to have a scratch or at least not anything indicating being hurt directly after being arrested ?
did any of their actual news anchors covered it ?
how about their pundits ?
anyone ... ?
they covered that this morning .
sorry ya racist fuck , but __name1__ has covered it on every single last show , that i have seen .
pity you suck so fucking much that honesty can n't seep in .
but you keep praying for __name1__ to get killed .
i 'm sure __name1__ answers prayers as well .
they did n't cover it yesterday .
so they were __quant1__ entire day late in a big news story .
that is equivalent to like __quant1__ week in the news business .
and they 're supposed to be the __value1__ news network .
why is that ?
could it be that they were waiting to get their talking points and marching orders sorted out ?
hmmmmm ..... ?
so what did they say anyway ?
i 'm curious to know .
racist __name1__ wannabe post .
nothing more , nothing less .
your claims are completely inacurate .
i know that from simple observation .
__quant1__ saw about __quant1__ hour total on it on fnc yesterday , and there wre various invterviews including the lawyer( s ) for the family of the victim
ok , fair enough .
what were they saying about it ?
finish your statement/report .
they showed the video just like all the other news did yesterday and then said that the video was to grainy to make any judgment and people should wait until the medical reports about it come out .
ahhh ....
yes , they 've got their talking point sorted out .
pretty much all the rwers were repeating that meme yesterday ....
" it 's too grainy , so we should wait ."
of course they want to wait , that video is damning .
thanks for your response though .
the story is aimed at you , marccy , the red meat in your racialist worldview .
the story is pumped by those who what a virtual race @-@ war , who prosper when the races are at each other ' throats .
wise up .
excuse me miss , but what does that word mean ?
racialist ....
one to whom race is the determining factor in analyzing events and relationships .
ra·cial·ism ( rsh @-@ lzm ) · n .
__value1__ .
a . an emphasis on race or racial considerations , as in determining policy or interpreting events .
b . policy or practice based on racial considerations .
think that is a wise basis for decisions ?
__name1__ was right , “ all your skin folks ain’t your kin folks .
and all your color ain’t your kind ! ”
__name1__ was a __name2__ who was generally sympathetic to the __name3__ and a fan of __name4__ 's self @-@ help politics .
she disagreed with the philosophies ( including __name2__ and the __name3__ ) supported by many of her colleagues in the __name1__ .
you 're being used , marccy ....
the story is used to plant the seed that you must vote for the black candidate because of all those vicious white racists who are out to get you ...
__name1__ ...
' white ' __name1__ .....
get it ?
__quant1__ black men .
__quant1__ club .
and not intimidating or bothering anyone usless black intimidating ?
blacks and white teen systematically beat up each other .
nothing news worthy .
__name1__ do beat up and kill blacks but when did the __name2__ kill or beat up anyone .
__name1__ administration did not see anything illegal or unlawful by the new __name2__ standing on the side walk and white people entering the polling station not afraid .
black man with a stick in intimidating but a white man with a gun is not ?
white woman behind them do n't seem to be intimidated ?
__name1__ were being harassed by white man with big mouth .
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=negbkhyguhu"> " security " patrols stationed at polling __name1__ in __name2__ - youtube </a>
there 's still yapping and squeeling on and on and on about __quant1__ anonymous black dudes with a stick playing dress up .
as if it 's supposed to be some big deal .
white racist mfers walking around brandishing armed guns ....
no big deal .
these racist rwers never cease to amaze me .
racist .
it was on __name1__ sunday .
however it 's a non story other than for political opportunists .
i think the " bigger " story is , how many " leaders " that are for " racial equality " are demanding a lynching .
i guess its okay if you are on the ' right ' side of the rope ?
why is this the biggest news story ?
of course __name1__ thinks that it 's much to do about nothing .
so he bashes the coverage .
he does n't get it .
__name1__ bill __name2__ __value1__ martin media coverage is ' demagoguery ' ( video ) </a>
although this guy does ...
__name1__ is partially correct , although probably not in the way he thinks .
the thing about this case that has turned it into such a big story is that it is something different to everyone .
to some it about racial profiling .
to some it is police sweeping it under the rug .
to some it is about the __name1__ law .
to some it is about concealed carry .
and the list goes on .
some see it merely as a crime .
those on the right who hold different views do n't have just __quant1__ view either .
take what scarborough said just the other day .
he claimed it was not about syg . __name1__ says the opposite .
what __value1__ made this a national case was that the police were not adequately investigating and were openly defending __name1__ .
the injustice of that drew everyone in . __name1__ gets that part right..
where he goes wrong is in his assessment of the continued coverage .
it is far more complex than what he tries to claim .
part of the continued attention is countering the kneejerk claims of people who defended __name1__ .
for example , the faise photos of __name1__ became an entire subset of stories .
the police station video became a big story because it countered all of the claims of __name1__ being severeiy beaten .
another aspect of the continued coverage is due to the genuine puzzlement that __name1__ still remains uncharged in a situation where most people would have been charged .
the slow trickling of information is another aspect that keeps this going .
it took weeks to get the __value1__ calls and even longer to get the police station video .
various other information , such as police reports , came out at other times .
much of the information was due to independent investigation ( that the police should have done ) and thus came out as soon as it was available .
all of this plays into the __quant1__ hour news cycle .
so , what we have is an emotional case that means something different to everyone , and a situation ( brought on mostly by the police ) where information is discovered in a way that perpetuates the story .
wow i dont watch foxnews all day , but i turned it there and they had the story on .
look just because __name1__ doesnt bend over for __name2__ and __name3__ doesnt mean they are anywhere as right as the main media is left .
stop with the talking points .
instead of bashing foxnews , who doesnt edit __value1__ tape to change the story , light rockets under gas tanks to get trucks to explode , tout false documents as real , hire just __name1__ , fire __name2__ just because he wasnt a liberal anymore .
i could go on , but i think you get the point , those are some of the things off the top of my head that our " objective " media have done , funny how none of those " errors " favor the right , hmmmmmm
no it 's you who does not get it .
__name1__ 's father does n't deserve any blame at all .
why did n't __name1__ call his father and say " get out here and take this yahoo off my ass " instead of calling his girlfriend .
who knows ?
thats a good question but the boy is dead now .
which is a real shame that this family has had their son taken from them .
what i find troubling is that acting thug is a survival instinct in the " hood ".
many kids who are n't at all thugs feel that they have to at least act like one to survive .
there is a chance that non @-@ thug __name1__ went street rat on a man he assumed to be unarmed .
maybe it worked in the past .
in states that have these kinds of stand your ground laws , it is best to assume that everyone is armed and willing to use a weapon in the event of a threat .
when " hello " becomes " declare your intent " we will be well on our way to sanity , just as it was in the very beginning when all men had swords and bows .
well acting like a " thug " is not just something you see in the hood anymore , thanks to the world wide spread of hip hop culture you see people acting like that everywhere , i have seen white kids in __name1__ wearing doo rags and sagging their pants , believe it or not i have seen __name2__ teenagers acting like this in __name3__ and using the word " nigga " to each other , this is hardly specific for just blacks anymore , keep in mind people won't act the way they were as teenagers for ever , when __quant2__ was 17 i listened to hip hop , i had braids in my junior year of high school , i had a __quant1__ year old girlfriend with a __quant2__ year old baby , and i went by the nick name " lil al capone ", why do you ask ?
__name1__ was my hero as a teen and i looked up to him , now fast forward __quant2__ years later , i did __quant1__ years in the __name2__ , was deployed twice to the __name3__ , and i now have a good job working the government as a civilian , i have a clean arrest sheet , i was only arrested once for punching a guy in the face who tried to go behind the bar and attack the female bartender , once the police reviewed the rapes i was released with no charge .
the life i am living now is completely different than the one i had at __quant1__ .
why was trayvons body laying __quant1__ hours in the morgue ?
why did n't his father report him missing before he did ?
where was trayvons father when trayvon needed him the most less than __quant1__ feet away .
these are all questions that the __name1__ pd will have to answer and account for .
there 's no excuse why they bungled this up so horribly .
i know of only __quant1__ reason how this could have happened .
marc why was __name1__ 's body not claimed from the morgue until __quant1__ hours after his death ?
why did n't the father at least look out his window when all the shouting was taking place ?
where was the father when the shot was fired not more than a __quant1__ feet away ?
the distance is my guesstamation but the fight was n't far from where __name1__ 's father lived .
that is something news worthy .
title of the news story · where was __name1__ 's father when his son needed him the most ?
how is this relevant ?
do n't blame the father .
fuck you and fuck marc race baiting son of a bitch .
where the fuck was the father who sons less than __quant1__ feet away was dying ?
why did it take the father so long to report his son was missing ?
after all his son had been suspended for __quant1__ days from school .
marc seems to this there should be more news reporting about __name1__ do n't bitch about it when someone ask these questions because the longer this goes with media attention the more trayvon will not look like an angel but a child who did not have any parental guidance
not only are you coming apart at the seams and falling off the deep end , but you 're showing how openly racist you are .
again , good luck with that blaming @-@ the @-@ father @-@ of @-@ the @-@ murdered @-@ victim path that you 're on .
carry on .
why is __name1__ grinding away at __name2__ ?
they are clearly pushing an agenda .
why is the __name1__ defense team grinding away at the deceased victim , __name2__ , unleashing a smear campaign the likes that have never before been seen this century ?
w know , because for those who have followed the story , the father was out to dinner with his fiance .
when they arrived , they used the front entrance , and would n't have even seen any aftermath hours later ( if there were any ) in the common backyard .
he very likely just assumed his child was in bed , sleeping .
the very next morning was when he called in a missing persons report .
the idiot bigfatrebel is still blowing copious amounts of shit out of his ass .
his father may have called friends , etc. i have not read his father waited __quant1__ hours to call the police in any case .
[ quote=paperview ; 5056446 ]
thank you , paper
you 're welcome .
for those who need to see how the layout was , and where __name1__ 's fiance 's house was in relation to the shooting , here :
__name3__ being in the morgue for __quant1__ hours is not the fault of __name1__ pd . __name3__ did not have an id .
so why did n't the father call the pd and report his son was missing ?
did he allow __name1__ to stay out as long as trayvon wanted too ?
more media attention , and more media , period .
more tv channels , internet , mobile phones , etc. etc.
since i do n't pay any attention to __name1__ , i have no idea who he supports or why . nor do i care .
what i can tell you , hand on heart ....
__name1__ will freeze over before i 'd vote for __name2__ .
__name1__ , i could grit my teeth , hold my nose , and vote for - purely for his economic experience .
we need smart businessmen , not career politicians .
i 'll vote for almost anyone over __name1__ .
all of the repugs would be an improvement over barrack __name1__ .....
including __name1__ .
btw , __name1__ has n't been a politician for almost a couple of decades ......
so he 's not a career politician anymore .
however , when he was he 's the only one i can remember that actually got things done .
after all , he is responsible for balancing the budget and actually giving us a surplus .
when it comes to __name2__ , he 's a businessman but he would have been a senator if he could have beat __name1__ .
__name1__ pointed that fact out the other day .
what we need is new ideas and someone who can n't be bought .
i do n't give a shit whether they used to be a politician or not .
and there you have idiots pretending im not right because they can not face the real truth .
you think your all clever because you can insult .
you were the ones who picked the worst president in history .
your opinions are pretty meaningless to anyone who cares about real facts .
in what way did i insult you ?
yesterday __name1__ spent the entire program talking about how progressive __name2__ was .
the way he was talking about him it was like he was actually barrack __name1__ .
__name1__ almost sounded like he has lost his mind .
__name1__ supports __name2__ fundamentalists like __name3__ and __name4__ .
he feels that __name1__ is his choice for president .
__name1__ does n't think that now is the time to compromise on our principles .
well , from what i can see , religion is the __value1__ principle that __name1__ needs from his candidate .
if any of you do n't know , __name2__ is a __name1__ , or more accurately a member of the __name3__ , or lds . i am currently an inactive member of this same church .
i have some disagreements with the church .
some would say it is a cult .
__name1__ and __name2__ are __quant1__ prominent members btw . from what i 've seen it is a cult , a cult that __name3__ is a member of .
he is a prime example of why barrack __name1__ is currently our president .
folks that refused to accept anything other than their idea of a perfect candidate .
someone who has all of the right beliefs and says all of the right things .
i 've talked to these types .
the type of __name1__ that does n't like anyone of other faiths .
__name1__ that have forgotten the teachings of __name2__ or never learned them .
love thy brother as you would love yourself ...
regardless of his beliefs or his race .
__name1__ does n't support __name2__ because he thinks his immigration policies are too progressive .
he accuses __name1__ of being too progressive when it comes to health care .
he 's also another one of these nut cases that mistook what __name1__ said about __name2__ 's plan claiming he actually wants __name3__ social @-@ engineering , which is far from the truth .
__name1__ merely said he would not exchange __name2__ social @-@ engineering for __name3__ social @-@ engineering .
__name1__ has already made up his mind .
he supports __name1__ , and he supports __name2__ , but now he even says he 'd rather vote for __name3__ over __name4__ .
this is insane .
__name1__ would rather lose another presidential election then compromise on his crazy principles .
after listening to him yesterday i got the impression that __name1__ is slowly losing his fricken mind .
the way he was talking about __name1__ it sounded like he was describing one of the most evil politicians ever to walk the face of the earth .
i believe __name1__ does n't understand the way __name2__ thinks .
he 's totally misinterpreting his beliefs and thus doing a disservice to his candidacy and doing his best to usher in another __quant1__ years of barrack __name1__ .
i do n't think __name1__ really cares right now if this happens and that he may be one of the primary reasons it does .
i 'm not gonna voice my thoughts on what exactly is causing __name1__ to be so vocal about __name2__ or __name3__ in the past .
however i can say that it seems like he 's doing more damage to his own professed cause than good .
__name1__ glenn __name2__ tea party is racist __name3__ newt __name4__ - youtube </a>
__name1__ __value1__ __name2__ interviews gingrich | __name3__ | theblaze.com </a>
we should care what __name1__ and __name2__ think at this point ?
the __name1__ seems to be grasping at straws these days not to mention the value they place on irrelevant commentary from both of them .
the country is getting tired of you manufactured war between the __name1__ people
omgorsh
coming from an __name1__ supporter i find that extremely hilarious .
yet whenever a thread about glennbeck pops up you 're all over it like a hobo on a ham sandwich .
your party has been found out .
your bullshit of hating on half of the __name1__ people is getting your failed party no where .
that is why no decent __name1__ candidate ( the very few there are ) would run this go arround .
the __name1__ can suck my sack .
i do n't care what they want .
they sold us down the river when they pitched in with the __name1__ and took our __name2__ and used it to run up the debt .
i support workable solutions rather than ideologies .
i 'm willing to overlook a lot just to get __name1__ out of there .
anybody would give this government legitimacy again .
right now we 're a world @-@ wide laughing @-@ stock .
course no decent candidate ever runs as a __name1__ these days as well .
hmmmm ...
i like __name1__ .
i had always thought he was one of the better looking men in broadcasting ...
i do not always agree with what he says or his angles , but he seems to break things down on his show in such a way that the least informed can potentially better understand ...
there are times he 's been laughable ...
but it is so with most any politically based show , i suppose .
even the washington __name1__ has some callers ....
so that was n't you posting in the other __name1__ thread yesterday ?
every time the __name1__ has to pick a candidate to run for potus we see the same thing happening .
they use the same sleazy character assassinating techniqes on their fellow __name2__ that they use against the __name1__ .
really , folks , the __name1__ is a party with a servere character disordered problem in that respect .
remember when the big lies propagandists turned on one of their own who also happened to be a __name1__ triple amputee to accuse him of being a terrorist sympathizer ?
i mean seriously ...
how vile is that ?
the __name1__ is the party of character asssassination , big lies and big propaganda .
the __name1__ have their own underhanded techiques for internacine wars , of course , but the __name2__ really has the emotional and ethical iqs of a school yeard filled with __quant1__ year bullies .
ravi , honey , i criticized the media spin on his words .
that does n't mean i agree with him , or know who he does or does not support .
really ?
so you did n't even comprehend that he was against __name1__ .
that 's pretty amazing for someone that prances around and calls other people stupid , ignorant , and unable to comprehend the written word .
i was not overly interested in who he was criticizing .
that 's of no interest to me .
what fascinates me is the ability of seemingly logical people to fall for any old bullshit that the media put out .
truth comes second to point scoring with some people ....
not with me .
the right will defend anything to cling to their historically failed ideas .
__name1__ is a progressive .
he has said as much himself .
you also left out __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ .
this is also a primary not a general election .
this is the part where all the candidates get trashed .
are all the talkers supposed to love thees guys up or air out there dirty laundry ?
as for the __name3__ crap , __name2__ and the others are not thrilled about __name1__ .
i fail to see the conspiracy .
i did n't imply any kind of conspiracy .
i simply said __name1__ is one of those unbending __name2__ that will be the bain of the __name3__ .
as far as __name1__ is concerned , i do n't believe he 's a progressive .
that 's just another attempt to trash his ideas .
he 's as much a progressive as __name1__ or __name2__ .
let 's just say he 's more open @-@ minded than your average __name1__ .
he 's also not for bigger government , but more effective government .
this is just an attempt by the fringe elements on both sides to knock off another __name1__ front @-@ runner .
why on earth would __name1__ shut up ?
he does n't want us to come to a choose between __name1__ and __name2__ .
__quant1__ big government progressives .
and we have plenty of time to avoid that " choice " so he is reminding everyone who __name1__ is and what the __name2__ stands for .
we want to change washingon , so we are going to send in the biggest __name1__ insider campaigning ?
we want to close the border by supportng someone who does n't ?
we want to get government out of our lives by supporting someone who has supported the expansion of this government ?
we want to restore the __name1__ by supportng someone who has voted contrary to it when convenient ?
the only thing going for __name1__ is that balanced budget during the __name2__ administration .
he 's smart and he 's a good talker .
but you know what , there is something more important than talking big .
what 's the point of being smart if your working for things that are n't good ?
i want to see this nation change for the better .
i want to see this government shrink .
honestly , i do n't know if any of the candidates will actually do that .
but of all of them , __name1__ is the one that has grown it the most .
he go 's after __name1__ as much as __name2__ .
and __name1__ has called himself a progressive .
i agree that __name1__ puts to much religion into his politics , but as far as bashing the __name2__ candidates he is no worse then the other gop water boys on the radio .
after the primary they will all rally around the one who wins .
this morning i was watching " __name1__ " on __name2__ , which is part of the __name3__ network .
the co @-@ host were interviewing a guy who is part of the on @-@ going occupation of __name1__ st . , and were ( of course ) repeating the media standard line by questioning the man as to why there is no set goals or leadership to advocate such goals .
during his response , the man pointed out that it 's about all types of people pointing out that nothing is being done about the economic inequality and subsequent crimes perpetrated by __name1__ st./banking giants ( individuals and corporations ) ....
and that you had leaders from various backgrounds join in . he stated that __name1__ " a self made man from the streets like me " was joining .....
at which time co @-@ host __name1__ interjected ( twice ) that like __name3__ , __name2__ is a self made man .
come again ?
__name1__ inherited his father 's ownership of __quant1__ newspapers in the __name2__ ( __name3__ ) .
he did not start out in the copy room of some local city paper and work his way up to mogul .
__name1__ grew up doing the preacher circuit for his particular brand of religion .
big difference .
i saw this as just another __name1__ flunkie pushing the " class warfare " line that 's heard from the neocon @/@ teabagger pundits in the media .
by trying to equate __name3__ as a successful " every man ", co @-@ host __name1__ pushes the subliminal context that the __name2__ st. protesters are just " jealous " of " successful people ".
typical __name1__ bs ....
but not unexpected .
anyone comparing al sharkskin to anything other than an elocutionary murderer on a scale comparable with __name1__ and all around steaming pile of
should have their head examined , so yea , __name1__ blew it .
great catch
unfortunately class envy @/@ class warfare works .
the __name1__ are turning __name2__ against __name2__ .
it 's an awful ' divide & conquer ' strategy .
look for them to ratchet this stuff up much more as the election draws nearer .
anything to hold on to power i guess .
it 's very sad .
laughable to say the least .
the right brays on and on about unions , public employee benefits , the poor not paying __name1__ tax , people on welfare and food stamps and people on ssi .
then..
when anything is mentioned about the outrageous behavior of the the top tier in this country..
it 's class warfare .
amazing .
no not really , whats laughable is the overabundance of shallowness you possess as opposed to any scintilla of critical thinking ....
anyone who would compare __name1__ to __name2__ is just well a moron and a major pile of shit .
do n't hate your fellow __name1__ .
being a success is a good thing .
do n't be jealous and bitter .
that only leads to hate and violence .
__name1__ has a plan for us all .
stay true to him and he will stay true to you .
some politicians are now just preying on human weakness .
they are promoting this class envy @/@ class warfare stuff to get and hang onto power .
it 's not healthy for our nation .
turning __name1__ against __name1__ is just wrong .
a house divided will surely fall .
you say do n't hate your fellow __name1__ but have no problem supporting people who go after union workers , and the so called " moochers ".
and __name1__ is right up there promoting class warfare , running a story on makers and moochers is a prime example of that .
so please take your hypocritical bullshit somewhere else .
__name1__ covers various angles of all issues .
you chose only that __quant1__ angle to focus on .
but that 's ok with me .
that 's how you feel .
i was just saying how wrong it is for politicians to promote such jealousy & bitterness towards fellow __name1__ .
it is a deliberate ' divide & conquer ' agenda .
we do n't need to turn on each other .
that 's not the right way to go .
hating a fellow __name1__ because he or she is more successful than you will only lead to more hate & violence in this country .
i really do hope more __name1__ turn to __name2__ in the future .
__name1__ bless and have __quant1__ good day .
you are incapable of comprehension it appears , its not hard , try reading what i said slowly , maybe 3 times , you 'll get it .
hating __name1__ because they are not as successful as you also leads to more hate .
telling them it is their own fault they are not rich( you buddy __name2__ ) is just as much class warfare as anything that has been said by the __name1__ .
comparing people who make more , and pay more taxes to the middle class and lower middle class , and calling them makers and takers is class warfare .
yeah , i got what you are saying .
you are still a pile .
crisis averted then ....
hate to point out the obvious ( i lie ) but when __name1__ inherited those tow papers in __name2__ he had been working as an editor for a different paper in another country .
he then built those tow papers into a media empire that makes idiots like you froth at the mouth .
if that is not a self made man i have never heard of one .
well them you , squire , have never heard of one .
slap out of it ! !!
he took __quant1__ small papers with declining circulation in a small city in south __name1__ and built a media empire and made himself on of the wealthiest men in the world .
explain to me , in detail , and using the small words you can understand , how that is not an example of a self made man .
the ows are just a bunch of spoiled kids that want great pay w/o the education or effort it takes to get it .
none of them are taking personal responsibility , just blaming __name1__ st.
i 'd be embarrassed to have anyone in my family involved in this non @-@ sense .
obviously you 're totally ignorant as to the make up of the people participating in the protests .
they are senior citizens who got screwed out of their retirement ...
they are college grads who got the grades and are now looking at debt w ith no job prospects ....
they are parents , spouses , long time employees who saw their jobs outsourced overseas ....
and all of them have watched __name1__ st. and it 's banking buddies in management making out like bandits , and then bitch that they may have to give up some tax breaks and loopholes .
if i were you , i 'd be embarassed to voice your ignorance in public .
utter fucking nonsense .
i just went from one job to another .
it took me __quant1__ whole month to find it .
there 's jobs , it 's just that those whiny bitches won't take anything they can find .
your lack of information and vast wealth of propaganda , must make it hard to carry on an honest conversation .
sure they are .
stop getting your info from __name1__ .
you guys talk about class warfare , i think the right is more involved in class warfare than anyone else .
the problem is , you are going after people just like you .
dont be dim .
i listen to what they say on camera , on __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ .
they are all a bunch of spoiled kids , or whiny adults that want other people to take care of them .
what the hell does that bolded part mean ?
anybody ?
i forgot how willfully ignorant and purposely obtuse you can be , cali @-@ girl .
let me dumb it down for you : __name1__ was born into the __name2__ equivalent of upper middle @-@ class ....
the next best thing to being " old money ".
so he had advantages from birth ...
he did not have to work his way up the ladder or beat his brains to get a scholarship .
so the comparison to __name1__ as a " self made man " is a crock .
got that , bunky ?
actually , lackytiberal , i was wonder when __name1__ became part of the __name2__ .
twit .
still waiting for tackyliberal to explain what ' in the __name1__ ( __name2__ )' means .
__name1__ is not in the __name2__ .
i stand corrected .
now , do you have the cojones to deal with the facts that back up my opening posts point regarding the idiotic comparison of __name1__ to __name2__ as " self made men "?
i 'm a details person ....
factually accurate details .
lesson : __name5__ : the countries of __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , and __name4__ .
__name4__ : the countries of __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ .
not rocket science .....
or maybe it is .
it seems many __name1__ are incapable __name1__ grasping that fairly straightforward fact .
now , to address your " point ".
__name1__ inherited __quant1__ fairly successful newspapers and turned them into a global media empire .
so , he is a ' self made man ', if you want to quibble over that , fine .
personally , i do n't give a shit about __name1__ or __name2__ 's ' success '....
i have zero respect for either .
how 's that obsession working for ya champ ?
if you are addressing me , please explain how telling the truth and pointing out lies re : __name1__ and the __name2__ an " obsession "?
unless you can prove me wrong , it would seem that you are obsessed with just being contrary to anything i post .
carry on .
anyone reading your manic , endlessly repetitive , __quant1__ @-@ note screeching on this thread alone can see the obsessive rantings of a defective mind at work .
u do n't need a diploma to be a success
if you 're referring to the limbaugh @-@ esque bs you 're about to regurgitate , then i whole heartedly agree .
good for you ....
where do you live ?
where you fired ?
down sized ?
left for better pay ? what 's the unemployment rate in your area ?
what 's your field of expertise ?
what was the job ?
in the same field as the old one ?
are you saying that because you got a job that everyone else that does n't have one is n't trying ?
spoken like a true willfully ignorant neocon @/@ teabagger parrot ....
you got yours , so everyone else is just a slacker looking for a handout .
obviously , the reports of major downsizings by various corporations and industries , the official reports spotlighted by __name1__ and the __name2__ showing how companies are not opening their doors to higher people , and the __value1__ % unemployment rate verified by the unemployment insurance rates reported by all press regardless of political affiliation is lost on your closed mind .
an apt projection of yourself , bunky .
no , you 're not nuts ...
just a pathetic liar and bs artist .
bottom line : my story stands based on facts easily verified in the current news .
all you 've got is some personal claim and some ass backwards assessments as to what 's going on in the real world .
carry on .
no genius , they want more jobs to be available ....
they want the rat bastards on __name1__ st. and their banking buddies to be held accountable for the crimes against society ( theft ) , and they want to stop being used by the wealthy to pay for their largesse and errors i.e. , union busting , lopsided tax breaks and loopholes .
i got that from listening to __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ .....
seems you need to get your head out of __name1__ 's fat ass , clean out your ears , and expand your cognitive reasoning and listening skills .
actually , you 're just another dumb bunny neocon @/@ teabagger who does n't have the guts to admit you 're wrong as you continually pull stuff out of your ass and try to pass it off as " facts ".
the chronology of the posts shows i readily conceded my geographical error ....
which does not disprove the facts regarding my opening or subsequent posts .
grow the fuck up , cali @-@ girl and stop making an ass of yourself ...
even i am beginning to feel embarassed for you .
hate to point out your painfully obvious regurgitation of a false premise ( i lie ) , but his editorial work for a __name1__ tabloid did not lead up the ladder of hard work to being head of one of __name3__ 's leading news paper __name2__ .....
he inherited that when his father died .
__name1__ , the son of __name2__ ( __year1__ @–@ __year2__ ) , a famous __name3__ war correspondent and publisher , studied at __name4__ , __name5__ ( m.a . , __year3__ ) , and briefly worked as an editor on lord beaverbrook 's __name6__ , where he first gained practical experience in the sensationalist journalism that would be a major influence early in his career as a publisher .
his father having died , he returned to __name1__ in __year1__ to take over his inheritance , __name2__ and the news , both of __name3__
no one is denying __name1__ 's personal success ....
but to keep trying to push this bs that he 's a " self made man " is just that ...
bs . only a complete idiot would believe that an editor of a tabloid becomes the overnight owner of __quant1__ major newspapers based solely on his merit and salary .
but then again , in the desperate attempt to defend the neocon @/@ teabagger status quo and legends , a quantum windbag will blow any smoke necessary .
carrry on .
where did i say it did ?
what i said was that he was working for someone else when his father died .
he inherited __quant1__ papers in __name1__ , the capital of __name2__ ( which is a state ) .
he then built those __quant1__ papers into a major media empire by making them profitable and expanding his holdings to other papers in __name1__ , and then the __name2__ .
it was what he did after he inherited them that make him a self made man , not the fact that he inherited them .
if he had been like you those papers would have been dead by now and no one would have heard of __name1__ .
tai chi - __name1__ needs a rest and some heavy meds .
once again , cali @-@ girl displays not only willful ignorance , but a insipid stubborness regarding her ignorance .
__name1__ is a standard major paper in __name2__ ...
__quant1__ years and standing .
__quant1__ knew this from __quant1__ ago , but dumb toots like cali @-@ girl could have easily googled such .
i 'll break my rules and do her homework for her just this once :
__value2__ rupert murdoch biography - facts , birthday , life __value1__ - biography.com </a>
no one is denying __name1__ 's successes , but a " self made man " is n't handed __quant1__ successful newspapers to start building his empire .
like all ignorant neocon @/@ teabagger blowhards , once cali @-@ girl is proven wrong , she suddenly states that she does n't care about the very subject she so ardently sounds off about .
but again , only a complete idiot would try to make __name1__ the equivalent to a local penny saver .
but that 's our cali @-@ girl ...
who 's beating the dead horse of my error in putting __name1__ in the __name2__ despite my conceding and admitting such .
probably the only orgasm the little fool will have this year .
carry on .
you 're ' probably ' an overly emotional whiner .
truthfully , i do n't give a rat 's ass what __name1__ inherited - it 's not my business .
however , you seem to have an unhealthy interest in other people 's lives .
how sad .
ahhh , the final gasp by a defeated neocon @/@ teabagger toadie !
riddle me this , cali @-@ girl ...
if you do n't give a rat 's ass about the subject at hand , then why devote so much time and effort in trying to disprove what i wrote ?
why do you stubbornly keep parroting the same old __name1__ lines when you know you 've been logically and factually proven wrong ?
are you having a psychotic break ?
fucking stupid ?
stubborn and fucking stupid ?
or do you just have an axe to grind with me personally ?
tell you what , if you truly do n't care , then stfu , put me on ia and save yourself the trouble .
but if you do n't , then my assessments of you are pretty much on target , and i won't have to waste any more time on you on this thread .
adios , muchacha !
there is no evil conspiracy here .
__name1__ has been proven to be more fair & balanced than liberal media outlets .
just take a look at the number of liberal @/@ __name1__ commentators they have on air .
someone posted the list earlier .
maybe they could post it again ?
and __name1__ is an incredibly successful businessman .
i do n't see how anyone could deny that .
the only thing i questioned - and rightly - was your comment that __name1__ is in the __name2__ .
twit .
as you can see by this link , paulitician is just some clown with an axe to grind who just regurgitates right wingnut talking points and mantras just to be part of the conversation and push along the right wingnut presence .
just ignore this clown , folks .

the chronology of the posts makes cali @-@ girl out to be a bald faced liar .
and if that were n't enough , there was this from the previous response :
say goodnight gracie ....
shows over for you .
sure they are .
wow , you take moran to a whole knew level .
__name1__ did n't steal , __name2__ gave them __quant1__ .
the rest is the whiny bullshit i was talking about .
wow , if you 're attempting to insult someone , try improving your spelling skills for a better impact .
are you truly this ignorant of what went on in the last __quant1__ years , or are you just some insipidly stubborn neocon @/@ teabagger hack ?
stop , take your __quant1__ thumbs out of your ass and think !
why was the __name1__ st./banker bailouts necessary ?
then do some honest research and see when all this crap started ( hint : __quant1__ years of __name1__ ) .
but i suspect you 're just some dumb kid who 'll repeat his neocon @/@ teabagger nonsense ad nauseum while refusing to look at any facts that will contradict your beliefs .
carry on .
[ if the __name1__ does n't know that barak __name2__ is n't a senator , then i would n't expect them to know very much about very much .
including __name1__ .
geez , at least try to keep up .
at the time __name2__ was fielding for __name3__ __name1__ was a senator and that is the time frame the __name4__ is talking about .
but if for some reason you just can n't get past your lack of confidence in __name2__ why not just do some google research using such keywords as , __name1__ lied , or variations on that theme .
i promise you 'll come away with a much clearer understanding of this self @-@ serving , mendacious little bitch than you presently have .
you will obviously believe anything , you voted for an empty suit and admit it ..........
you are almost as big of a joke as that dildo rdean .
no.
you did n't follow my link .
__name1__
__value1__ href="http://www.dailykos.com/special/about2#dk"> http://www.dailykos.com/special/about2#dk </a>
it goes to the __name1__ 's description of itself , not to the article .
( thus the link is called about daily kos )
they still refer to senator __name1__ as a contributing blogger to their blog .
i keep hearing about the “ liberal media ” and yet , it ’s that same liberal media that never asks the difficult questions of __name1__ .
only when __name1__ bring up the anti gay stance or anti __name3__ or __name4__ stance of __name2__ does it make it on the news .
__quant1__ jobs moved to __name1__ during the __name2__ administration and where is the “ investigative reporting ”?
__name1__ get such a free pass .
so here is condoleezza on __name1__ .
she was asked why the __name1__ left __name2__ and went into __name3__ ?
she said , “ we always wanted a “ small footprint ” in __name1__ .
there were never going to be more troops ”.
oh , yea , that makes sense .
not to you , or to me , but the strategic and tactical goals are not something i am privy to .
do you know what they were ?
when asked why we got __name1__ and not __name2__ , she actually said that us to get __name2__ , we would have needed “ donkeys ”.
i ’m not making this up .
you expect the troops to carry all that equipment themselves ?
she said __name1__ is the __value1__ democracy in the __name2__ , even though the __value2__ democracy was actually __name3__ .
and she ’s a college professor , although a __name1__ college professor , so she can be forgiven .
iran ?
never mind .
you believe that democracy works from the top down , which is why you always vote the way the __name1__ tells you to vote .
it is a lot easier than thinking for yourself , is n't it ?
she said that __name1__ ’s democracy will blunt __name2__ .
except __name1__ has written __name2__ law into their constitution .
__name1__ is the national religion and all legislation is to be based on islam .
this is why women are in burkas .
why women can’t go outside without a male escort .
is it any wonder that their women are addicted to valium ?
after going from being doctors and engineers and dressing like __name1__ women to burkas and being slaves ?
__name1__ won’t blunt __name2__ .
the __name1__ and __name2__ policies have turned __name3__ into __name4__ .
well , since __name1__ is a democracy , and __name2__ uses sharia law , they should blunt each other .
gee , i can actually follow your logic .
and on racism , when asked about __name1__ , and remember , when __quant2__ whites were shown with bottled water and bread , they were called “ survivors ”, but when __quant2__ blacks had bottled water and bread , they were “ looters ”, she said , “ we have to stop talking about race to “ heal ”.
sounds like a typical __name1__ “ plan ”.
shut the victims up and everything will go away .
is the government supposed to interfere with free speech ?
or are you trying to claim the __name1__ herself said these things ?
and no one challenged her on anything .
it was a disgrace .
what exactly were they supposed to challenge her on ?
what did she lie about ?
you 're a fucking racist .
is this a mainstream attitude within the left ?
as i told you elsewhere , if i were a racist i would not have voted for __name1__ .
but the word racist is so over @-@ used and so frequently misused that it 's come to mean whatever the respective user wants it to mean .
so , once again , my understanding of the word racist is it refers to one who dislikes all members of a specific race because they belong to that race -- which excludes me from the category .
by the way , i hasten to add that if i were a racist i would not hesitate to admit it because i 'd have no reason not to .
now , what is your definition of the word , racist ?
what exactly is it you 're accusing me of .
i do not know what her definition of racist is , but if you want mine i suggest you look in a mirror .
<a __name2__ christoper donovan : hate @-@ fueled black mass __name1__ in connecticut spun as ‘ disgruntled man ’ __name3__ observer blog </a>
yet the majority of the msm totally underplayed the racial angle , for reasons everyone by now understands : the killer was black , and the victims were white .
my own local newspaper made absolutely no mention of the racial element in the small brief it ran .
but given that race was what ( rightly or wrongly ) drove the entire incident , the media ’s censorship of this is a gross dereliction of duty .
his own words indicted him as a racist .
he was a thief and got caught so he decided to exact retribution against all of those racists he did n't like .
that 's pretty close to the truth although i think he suffered from other problems and scapegoated others for those problems .
this is common among people who suffer deep depression or other illnesses .
now , if he was drinking on the job he just exacerbated the situation 10 fold because alchohol is simply a sedative that slowly puts your brain to sleep starting with the logical side so your left running on pure emotion .
very bad and has nothing to do with him being black .
i think anyone who goes in to work and kills __quant1__ people is probably suffering from some sort of illness .
regardless of why he did it , i still do n't see how thinking other people treated one in a racist manner makes one a racist .
and funny that wj would accuse someone of being what he so proudly is ....
<a __name2__ christoper donovan : hate @-@ fueled black mass __name1__ in connecticut spun as ‘ disgruntled man ’ __name3__ observer blog </a>
but given that race was what ( rightly or wrongly ) drove the entire incident , the media ’s censorship of this is a gross dereliction of duty .
being black is n't a genetic defect .....
but mentally this guy was all screwed up because of his obsession with race .
this guy was messed up ....
only a social degenerate feels that murder is a solution to depression .
if he had been white and all his victims black .....
ya the press would not have mentioned that at all .
maybe if the company hired more blacks or asians all the victims would n't have been white .
or maybe he would n't have felt justified in killing anyone .
then again maybe he was just a low @-@ life that could n't get along with anyone of the wrong color .
maybe he feels everyone hates him because he 's black
i think race was simply an easy answer for him .
i do n't think he was necessarily racist to begin with .
it 's possible , but we do n't have enough to data to say either wasy so we can only speculate .
you 'd be surprised what extremely sad people are capable of when they start to pin their problems on the wrong people .
they turn hate into violence .
it does n't sound like he killed people simply because they were white .
the irony here is that if it had been a white man killing black people with the same circumstances , you would have made it a racial issue , ravi ....
no doubt about that .
your stereotypes run deep , do n't they ?
i thought i was pointing out your stereotype , ravi .
got any proof of that skippy ?
" you probably want to know the reason why i shot this place up , " thornton said .
" they treat me bad over here , and they treat all the other black employees bad over here too .
so i just took it into my own hands and i handled the problem , " he said .
" i wish i coulda got more of the people ."
the guys a real idiot .
i mean , why did he kill himself ?
i 'm sure __name1__ would have had all the charges against him dropped .
sounds like this nutter was racially motivated to be sure .
but the primary issue here is that he was a nutter who decided to kill people who pissed him off .
what motivated him to target whites is actually not all that important .
nutters often target one group or the other .
woman are the most targeted demographic by serial murderers , regardless of race .
and coworkers ( also regardless of race ) are the people most frequently targeted in work @-@ related mass killing events like this .
if the place had been manned by black people ?
it 's entirely possible this nutter would still have killed everybody he could find .
we 'll never know , really .
maybe the white people drove him crazy at work , but i kinda doubt it .
he was nuts __value1__ .
his targets ( and his stated motivation ) are just based on who was around him to become targets would be my guess .
in this guy 's case ?
it was white people he could blame , and therefore attempt to justify his murderous urge .
co @-@ workers are often the targets in work @-@ related murders ?
sorry , for some reason it 's funny that was pointed out .
he was just a disgruntled common thief who got caught stealing beer ( on video ) , got fired , mass murdered , who happened to be black .
no more , no less .
onto the next roadside attraction .....
exactly
other then the fact that he bragged to his mother that he killed white people .
was that thru a medium ?
cause he 's dead .
actually , he was more playing the victim , the martyr .
you have to open your mind to the distinct possibility that accusations of " racist " against whites themselves come from the racist motivations of non @-@ whites .
i know , you have to connect a few dots there .
but that 's what 's going on .
if you do n't know what happened , why do you comment ?
there was no racism at his workplace .
we 've elected a black president , we are in the " post @-@ racial " era , remember ?
that could be true in some cases but i imagine it is actually pretty rare .
out of __quant2__ dock workers only __quant1__ were black and __quant3__ 'd hate to be __quant3__ of the __quant4__ still there .
maybe but when a guy goes off and kills a bunch of people and after the fact he and his family say it was because of racism .
when that person never reported any such problems to his job or union .
you have to wonder if maybe this is not one of the " rare " times .
only __quant1__ eh , well lest see blacks are __value1__ % of the population .
so __quant1__ would have been an exact fair representation of blacks to white with __quant2__ total employees .
4 is low but not terribly so .
he claimed racism at his other jobs too .
according to them , the only trustworthy news source is __name1__ .
i mean , any station that reports the news that does n't slant their way is obviously liberal biased .
could n't the the right be saying the exact same thing about the liberal biased media ?
__name1__ did a study a few years ago which proved liberal bias .
__name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ did n't do any story on the __name4__ fiasco , nor the follow up with the a.j. i guess it was n't newsworthy enough for the liberal media .
so i 'll ask this again .
which is more likely , be honest ...
that all media , except for __name1__ is biased .
while __name1__ is the only one reporting fair and even coverage of every story
or
or there are biased news on both sides , __name1__ on one side , __name2__ on the other and everything else just falls in between .
step back and give me an honest answer .
which one seems more plausible ?
it might be wise to just throw out the labels and ask why a story is or is not covered .
what seems plausible is that the gatekeeppers are still keeping the gates .
i think white conservatives are the __value1__ i need explaining racism to me .
when you focus nearly 95 percent on racism against whites you draw ridicule from educated people .
then you oppose __name1__ .
__name1__ is a liberals way of saying your inferior in a " nice " way .
ah another liberal being a racist .
implying he does not need to listen to conservatives why ?
because we are all racist ?
you do realize thinking like that is just as bad as thinking an entire race is inferior right .
__name1__ is not news , it 's __name2__ propaganda .
__name1__ is not quit as bad , but their sophomoric ways expose them .
__name1__ at least pretends with the fair balanced line for the moron __name2__ .
fox is biased to the right , i will not deny it , but they are far more fair and balanced than __name2__ or lol __name3__ . if you actually watch __name4__ , not the commentators like hanity and what not .
i mean the hard news part .
they are always very fair , and always have both sides of a story , and both sides represented by their guests .
just got done watching a segment on __name3__ about the __name1__ vs __name2__ controversy .
as you all know the __name1__ is alleging that __name2__ rallies are " rampant with overt racial messages and signs "
so they had __quant1__ __name1__ __name2__ men on .
1 from the __name1__ and one from the __name2__ .
the segment lasted maybe __quant1__ mins , and __name1__ allowed the guy from the __name2__ to about __quant2__ mins of that time .
he repeatedly claimed the __name1__ is rampant with racism .
during the entire __quant2__ mins __name1__ was showing __quant1__ different signs from a __name2__ rally .
over and over .
just __quant1__ , which were mildly racial .
the worst had a picture of what looks like an __name1__ native doing a dance and said __name2__ with the __value1__ as a hammer and sickle .
one said " send __name1__ back to __name2__ ", and the other one was not racial at all but made __name3__ look like a __name4__ or __name5__ style propaganda picture basically .
so after letting the guy from the __name1__ talk nearly the whole time .
they finally let the guy from the __name1__ talk .
he of course said that __name1__ and the __name2__ were purposely focusing on a handful of signs and ingoring , and even deliberately not showing the hundreds of other signs that were not even remotely racist .
now as there is video on the internet of __name1__ doing just that before .
i have no reason to assume anything other than they are doing just that right now .
interestingly enough the __name1__ is also claiming there were more than one sigh that read " lynch __name2__ " and " lynch __name3__ ".
__quant1__ problem .
nobody has been able to produce a single photo of these alleged signs .
in fact , i can not remember the guys name , but someone has offered __quant1__ dollars to anyone who can produce a picture of the alleged signs .
please people in todays world of a camera in every phone .
there is no way in hell there were signs that read " lynch __name1__ " or " lynch __name2__ " and nobody got a picture of them .
simply no way in hell .
this is clearly a complete fabrication , and it is also clear __name1__ and the rest of the liberal media are continuing to cherry pick signs from __name2__ rally 's , and try to paint the tea party as racist .
very disturbing that such a large segment of our media , is not only biased , but actually working for the __name1__ .
actively slanting stories to try and destroy the __name1__ .
they should all be ashamed , and have no right to call themselves objective .
very pathetic .
__name1__ brietbart offered 100k for anyone with video or audio evidence of the slurs allegedly yelled ( 15 times ) at black congressman as they walked outside to the __name2__ with __name3__ and the big gavel when they took the vote for the hc bill ....
the money is still up for grabs .
__name1__ is widely ridiculed by educated people .
it 's entertainment for conservatives .
__name1__ saturday said __name2__ loves its military members the way disgraced football player __name3__ loves dogs .
in his __name2__ special " __name1__ ...
but i 'm not wrong , " the outspoken comedian went on a vulgarity @-@ laden __quant1__ @-@ minute rant against __name1__ and the troops .
__name1__ : for the longest time , every __name2__ election has been based on some sentimental bulls**t : the flag , or the flagpin , or the __name3__ , or the , " it 's morning in __name3__ ."
__name1__ got a blowjob in the oval office .
and the __name1__ insulted president __name2__ on foreign soil .
and when that happens , it hurts the feelings of our troops .
and then __name1__ 's light goes out and she dies .
yes , yes , the love of our troops , the ultimate in fake patriotism .
are you kidding ?
the troops , we pay them like s**t , we f**k them and trick them on deployment , we nickel and dime them on medical care when they get home , not to mention the stupid wars that we send them to .
yeah , we love the troops the way __name1__ loves dogs .
you know how i would feel supported if i was a troop overseas ?
if the people back home were clamoring to get me out of this pointless errands .
that 's how i would feel supported .
but , you know , do n't hold your breath on that one fellas because , you know , when __name1__ invades a country , we love you long time .
seriously , we never , we leave like __name1__ relatives : not at all .
honestly , is this really what __name1__ wants broadcast on its network ?

he 's not wrong .
why do n't you go look at the number of soldiers who have had to stay well beyond their initial employment contract .
or the number of soldiers who get classified as having " personality disorders " instead of __name1__ .
or why do n't you go talk to __name1__ or countless other families who can n't get the truth from the military about their loved ones death or get the benefits that they well deserve .
and the fact we not only went to __name1__ but had troops lose their lives is a tragedy in itself .
he 's not ranting against the troops .
he 's ranting against people like you likely .
oh , and never mind the fact it took __quant1__ to get our troops serving overseas to get proper body armor .
and to this day , some of them still do not have proper equipment .
can you ever imagine being a parent who has to go to a pawn shop to get body armor for your son because the government is too cheap to provide it because they feel it is not cost effective for your son to be worth a couple extra __quant1__ dollars ?
i 'd say you put your foot in your mouth , but you just can n't seem to get your head out of your ass long enough at one time to do so .
__name1__ may be feeling inadequate these days so he 's cutting loose with another lefty rant to get his name in print .
it 's how he makes his living .
having no acting skills and very little talent __name1__ is becoming passe ' and he does n't like it .
could n't have said it any better ...
go __name1__ !
saying he stuck his foot in his mouth , implies that he feels sorry or embarrassed about what he said .
i highly doubt he is either .
and you obviously do n't watch __name1__ very much !
well i guess it is good that his popular show starts next week .
we fuck our people in uniform over all the time .
its crazy .
is n't this standing up for our troops ?
wanting them to get better pay , better medical care , force them to extend deployments ?
foot in mouth ?
can you read ?
and this is different from the others that make their living off of political punditry in what way ?
oh i 'm sorry , i must have missed it , what exactly about this quote is incorrect ? ??
what a retarded poll .
__value1__ off - __name1__ was predominately about local politics ( the same reason that a __name2__ won that __name3__ seat in a __name4__ stronghold ) - local issues and someone who listened to what the people were saying - economy , jobs , deficits etc. partisan morons on both sides are try to make it into party referendums or a referendum on the president .
yet president __name1__ still enjoys wide approval by the __name2__ voters .
the other issue - __name1__ 's feelings about healthcare reform is also somewhat colored by the fact that __name1__ has it 's own affordable healthcare program in place so it 's far less of a priority to it 's citizens than economy and jobs .
if you really think __name2__ is a " radical __name1__ " you really need to bone up on your history .
__name1__ 's approval ratings are plummeting around the nation !
you have got to be kidding , even in __name1__ !
while they are decreasing ( they started off unrealistically high ) - he still maintains pretty decent approval .
even __name1__ said that the election was not a referendum on the president : " it 's not a referendum on the president .
there are many issues ; you 're talking about national security , taxes , spending -- the health care plan certainly is important ."
it is , however a warning shot that he needs to listen to what people are concerned about .
__name1__ exit polls showed strong support for __name2__ :

__name1__ claims that voter anger in massachusettes ( the fail of the health care bill ) is because of __name2__ w __name2__
bwahahahahahahaha
do you fall for this ?
oh massachusettes really showed president __name1__ !
and __name1__ was so busy working for us ...
" that i think we lost some of that sense of speaking directly to the __name1__ people about what their core values are "
oh my gosh thats it ! !!!
i missed one of the __quant1__ speeches and statements __name1__ made during the year ...
i did n't realize my core value to be a radical __name1__ ! !!
meanwhile the __name1__ is trying to paint a happy face on __name2__ by saying __name3__ was a socialist
unbelievable !
okay so now who is falling for all this ?
and just how busy are you working ?
me ?
i 'm on my lunch hour
__name1__ , remember ?
silliness is underrated .
uh , __name1__ 's ratings and net worth would disagree ...
ratings and net worth have nothing to do with the fact that his crying makes him look silly .
all it means is that a lot of people are willing to watch his silliness .
-@ tso
__name1__ 's chin makes him look silly .
yeah , but the chin is a birth defect , lol .
__name1__ 's crying can be controlled .
there 's no crying in political discussion ! !!
__name1__ suffers from __name2__ and thus he can n't fathom that the voter 's anger in __name3__ would ever possibly be directed at him and at his administration run amuck .
his ego blinds him .
__name1__ 's win was a direct smack down of this admin and a complete rejection of the piles of dung being shoved down our throats .
anyone who believes otherwise is delusional .
oh and he keeps blaming __name1__ for the last __quant1__ years .
i agree ....
as 7 belong to __name1__ and 1 to __name2__ .
yep , folks are angry alright .
according to what ?
how do you explain __name1__ voters high personal approval of __name2__ ?
not really , look at __name1__ 's ratings .
-@ tso
not the question i meant for you to answer ...
how busy are you , compared to the president of the __name1__ ?
is that why you are a __name1__ ?
because __name1__ 's ratings are high ?
what are you talking about ?
i listen to __name1__ for a lot of reasons , regardless of ratings .
i listen to __name1__ because he always leads me out of trouble ( that i keep somehow finding )
__name1__ is good
xotoxi 's posts are silly ...
but he still has high ratings and a high net worth ( of rep ) .
with regards to __name2__ , __name1__ has failed you .
if only __name1__ were n't trying to brainwash kids into being __name2__ in the schools , everything would be okay ...
your proof is __name1__ ?
seriously ?
get off my phone !
oh this rocks i did n't know i could see it like this , it 's on now
<a __value1__ or die ' - __name1__ - foxnews.com </a>
now you are going to __name1__ ...
you are an idiot .
this tread will go down as one of the classic dumb ones ...
who is the idiot op again ?
yes ...
tell me how much you get done in comparison to president __name1__ .
well lets see :
jen : dishes this morning : check
__name1__ : health care bill : fail
jen : completed a new article : check
__name1__ : cap & trade : fail
jen : pay my bills : check
__name1__ : balance the budget ...
uh ...
jen : every assignment at my desk this morning : check
__name1__ : getting our troops out of __name2__ : check
oh wait
you just compared your household chores ( favorably ) to what the president of the __name1__ has to do .
bwahahahahahahahahahahaha ! !!!!!!!
yep ( proud defiance ) and to think i did n't use a teleprompter or surround myself with marxists .
it must be hard to be a puppet for __name1__ .
nah , that was __name3__ <a href="http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/shroder/040413"> __name3__ clinton __name1__ islam partnership : evidence of negotiations __name2__ america 's public school children </a>
__name1__ is too busy making sure the terrorists escape being questioned about other plots ...
then stop calling ....
sheesh
compared to __name1__ or all the marxist appointees he has working for him ?
you 're right though , __name1__ does spend a lot of time in front of a teleprompter
now about comparing how much we get done ....
and here i thought your posts could n't possibly get any more fucking stupid .
far , __quant1__ sex offenders - george kennedy , roy smith , and james easter - all of whom were friends of jennifer buchanan , nevaeh ’s 24 @-@ year old mother , have been under police scrutiny and jailed for non @-@ related crimes while the investigation continues more than __quant3__ week after __quant2__ @-@ year old nevaeh buchanan went missing
bitch mother should be arrested as well ...
who the hell hangs out with sexual offenders when they got a little one .....
you would be astounded how common it is .
for one thing , sex offenders lie about their past .
for another , they prey upon the vulnerable , the young , the weak .
drug addicts , people who are n't very smart or have emotional issues , etc.
there is national registery and state registery where you can look up sex offenders and where they live and if they live near you ....
which is why we have to stop telling our young that it 's normal and right for them to pursue sexual relationships outside of stable , committed relationships ...
and why we need to quit telling young mothers they have a " right " to a life .
they do n't have the right to kill their babies , and they do n't have the right to put them at risk in their pursuit of the next thrill ...
whatever that thrill may be .
i think it 's a matter of educating more than anything .
we have to stop the government from promoting promiscuous behavior , we should actively campaign to educate young women about the dangers they can be faced with , and teach them how to keep their kids safe .
and #1 is to avoid bringing people into the home where the kids are .
that should be your kids ' sanctuary , not the sanctuary of the freaks who live in the apartment below .
any one with a kid should know who lives next to them ...
by the registery

sick freaks come in all shapes and sizes !
using kids to make political points regarding criticism from right about criticism from leftist comedian .
it 's the left 's moronic insistence that #1 , children are n't valuable and are disposable , and #2 , they should be viewed sexually , that is at the base of the terrible situation children are in now .
i dont argue with that point at all , i may favor more progressive and liberal views on most things but family i am very traditional and conservative and am against sickos and pervs that do this kinda shit ...
that being said i really dont think sooo much " outrage " should be put on __quant1__ late night talkers attempt on bad sex jokes , there is way more to it then that that makes these people do these things !
it goes on because dumb ass liberals keep defending him .
but a significant percentage of the human population will .
and how many is that and show me your proof that people just won't move to another area .
btw if they do n't move , whose fault is that ?
damned peanuts in the __name1__ last year , damned wheat in __name2__ last year , and damned grains in __name3__ in __year1__ should have all walked to somewhere they could have grown properly .
really dumb statements , skull .
so if the earth warms areas that are too cold to grow crops will not become more fertile ?
the entire earth will become a scorched wasteland huh ?
ok __name1__ .
another inconvenient fact for the man made global warming crowd .
since __year1__ until today there has been no significant warming .
a further fact .
in the early __century1__ 's scientists predicted that over the next __quant2__ years the temperature would go up globally about __quant1__ degree .
and that is what it did .
so we had an __quant1__ year trend that saw a rise of __quant2__ @/@ __quant2__ of a degree world wide .
followed to date by a __quant1__ year period with no appreciable warming .
remind me again how we are all doomed ?
__value1__ climate __value1__ __year2__ in 1998 - __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ august __name1__ new scientist </a>
according to the dataset of the __name1__ ( see figure ) , __year1__ was the warmest year by far since records began , but since __year2__ there has been slight cooling .
but according to the dataset of __name2__ 's __name1__ ( see figure ) , __year1__ was the warmest since records began , with __year2__ and __year3__ tied in __value1__ place .
tracking the heat · why the difference ?
the main reason is that there are no permanent weather stations in the __name1__ , the place on __name2__ that has been warming fastest .
the __name1__ record simply excludes this area , whereas the __name2__ version assumes its surface temperature is the same as that of the nearest land @-@ based stations .
where the monitoring station positions are cuts both ways ..........
there are significant temperature differences just __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ miles either way .
the k00 ks never want people to know about that .
anybody who cant recognize that temperature station data readings are the definitive example of cherry picking = hopelessly duped .
i just realised i never actually answered the op.
amelia , it will be too late when the asteroid impacts somewhere on the planet and wipes out civilization .
too late because we could have done something about that .
on the other hand , other than cooling the planet ( relatively easy to do ) warming it up is far , far , far beyond our ability .
the point is , regardless of when it was , the ecosystem was completely different .
what caused the ' global warming ' then ?
if the __name1__ is warming , which it currently is not , there is nothing we have done to cause it , nor is there anything we can do to stop it .
you think trading carbon credits and enriching a small subset of people in the process is going to ' save ' the planet ?
give me a break .
and i 'm thought a fool for believing in god .
what caused warming in the past is irrelevant and the blanket statement that we can n't be causing it is false .
we know the properties of __name1__ and know that it 's about __quant1__ ppm above historical averages , since the advent of the industrial revolution with no other explanation for its rise .
given those facts , who 's kidding who ?
it 's time for the skeptics to prove something , not just sit back and deny or ignore facts that pile up on a daily basis .
you 're quick to jump on the factoid that " the __name1__ is n't warming up right now ", but even saying that shows the shallowness of the skeptic argument .
any other time we 'd be hearing about " natural cycles ", but when given evidence of just such a cycle blunting a warming trend , we hear crickets chirp !
top that off with " carbon credits " and that just shows that the argument from the skeptic side is political in nature and they 've given up on the science , preferring mere lip service about what happened in the past and natural cycles , but nothing about what 's been happening for the last ~ __quant1__ years !
you can n't take the past as a template for the future , if underlying conditions have changed .
that 's basic science and logic .
okay , you 're a lost cause .
so , we have another dumb fuck that gets his science from __name1__ and other news magazines .
ever hear of peer reviewed scientific journals ?
not to mention placing them in urban heat sinks .
gathering temperature data from an airport tarmac yields a vastly different result than from a park or a forest .
in __name1__ __name2__ , they moved the recording device from the airport to the city hall - less than a __quant1__ mile away , and average temperatures dropped 7° - a huge amount .
former mayor , __name1__ was elected to __name2__ , and was able to effect the change .
__name1__ did an in @-@ depth study on this particular bit of fraud .
it is startling .

ever hear of critical thought , fluffy ?
ok , be branded for the liar you are .
<a __decade1__ what 1970 s science said about global cooling </a>
a new paper exposing the myth of 70 s global cooling · over time , __name1__ has been steadily documenting 70 s research predicting global cooling .
it 's a rich resource but as he admits , could be more accessible .
now he has collaborated with thomas peterson and jr the liar you are.ohn fleck to publish the myth of the 1970 's global cooling scientific consensus , due to be published in the __name1__ .
the paper surveys climate studies from __year1__ to __year2__ ( and in a refreshing change to other similar surveys , lists all the papers ) .
they find very few papers ( 7 in total ) predict global cooling .
this is n't surprising .
what surprises is that even in the __decade1__ s , on the back of __quant1__ decades of cooling , more papers ( 42 in total ) predict global warming due to __name1__ than cooling .
and just wait till you see what they have to say about the business of global warming orthodoxy __quant1__ years from now .
__quant1__ years from now they will be talking about the assholes that could not recognize reality and prevented even preperation for consequences .
and what they say will not be complimentary .
yeah , and __quant1__ years ago some assholes with an agenda or a buck to make said the same thing about anyone who was n't ' sure ' we 'd all be under glaciers by now .
chumps like you are nothing new .
lol ! !!
logic is now a " thought processing error "?!?!
sorry , agw has been proven .
the only questions remaning are " when " and " how bad ".
sorry to have to call you a liar konradv , but alas , you are a liar .
agw has not been proven .
in fact , it has not even been elevated to the level of a theory .
agw remains a piss poor hypothesis lacking a single shred of hard , observable , repeatable evidence that provides a hard link between the activities of man and the changing climate .
i already showed you that there has been no decrease in __name1__ since __year1__ according to the satellite record in spite of a marked increase in atmospheric __name2__ .
the facts simply do n't support the agw claims .
but once again , if you believe there is proof that provides a hard link between the activities of man and the changing climate or that there is anything going on in the climate today that is outside the boundries of natural variability , feel free to post your proof .
by the way , a claim that it has been posted rather than an actual posting will only tend to reinforce my claim that you are a liar .
so says an anamous message board poster .
in the meantime , all the scientific societies in the world , all the national academies of science , and all the major universities state agw is a fact and a clear and present danger to all of us .
oh , who to believe ? ?????????????
all of them ?
all of us ?
and your level of expertise in this field is ?
it is time to tell the truth .
the climate was not born in __name1__ .
i know when one side tries to shut down the debate saying there is a consensus , they 're lying .
i know when the only solution is to spend __quant1__ for minimal , unproven benefit , i know the liar is a leftist .
indeed and well put .......
but no worries here .
these people are losing in sound fashion .
the reason ?
they never want to face answering the question , " at what cost ? "
fortunately for the majority .........
they do the math , and we dont have to worry about these fuckkers fubaring the future of our kids .
the link between mind and social / environmental @-@ issues .
the fast @-@ paced , consumerist lifestyle of industrial society is causing exponential rise in psychological problems besides destroying the environment .
all issues are interlinked .
our minds cannot be peaceful when attention @-@ spans are down to nanoseconds , microseconds and milliseconds .
our minds cannot be peaceful if we destroy nature .
the __value1__ rule of sustainability is - destroy less .
the fewer things we make the more sustainable we are .
a society that destroys ecosystems for " consumer goods " in addition to food , clothing , shelter is the least sustainable - and will exist for the shortest duration .
industrial society has destroyed necessary things [ animals , trees , air , water and land ] for making unnecessary things [ consumer goods ] .
in " industrial society " work turns into overwork , unnecessary work , destructive work .
" growth rate " - " economy rate " - " gdp " · these are figures of " ecocide ".
these are figures of " crimes against nature ".
these are figures of " destruction of ecosystems ".
these are figures of " insanity , abnormality and criminality ".
infinite growth and development on a small planet that is just __quant1__ km in circumference ?
- industrial society is insane .
sushil_yadav · industrial society destroys mind and environment
so i guess we should just go back to our pre industrial ways then .
to bad for about half the worlds population since we could in no way feed and support such a large population with out industry
you have demonstrated a facility for creative writing of a sort .
what pray tell is your solution ?
you are a child ...
someone forgot to check your id .
the article is a summary of the actual report ...
and yes , i can __name2__ __name1__ easily , it 's called __name2__ translator .
try it sometime ...
but then you 'd have to face even more real facts .
so you 've read the actual report ?
it supports everything we have already told you ...
all the facts you ignored .
instead of wasting your time neg repping people just because you were made to look the fool you really should go look at all the facts .
here 's the thing , my theory , you are either some little brat so pissed off at the world you do n't care about learning anything real but need something to blame on the adults of the world ( since you do n't know the use of maroon as an insult it 's very likely ) ...
or you are a __name1__ heir and just want to make certain to get more than you deserve when he dies .
was that a yes or a no ?
here , i 'll try again .
have you read the actual report ?
there are no such things as yes or no questions , all questions must be fully analyzed , unlike your logic we who know global warming is a hoax use our brains for more than inflating our heads , we think and actually look at all the facts before making wild claims .
again , i guess you did n't get the question .
let me try harder
whether to read a report or not , perhaps you should take a gander at it and see what it says yourself .
go on , find it and translate it for yourself .
your eyes won't bleed from the truth honestly .
" unlike the surface @-@ based temperatures , global temperature measurements of the __name1__ 's lower atmosphere obtained from satellites reveal no definitive warming trend over the past __quant1__ decades .
the slight trend that is in the data actually appears to be downward .
the largest fluctuations in the satellite temperature data are not from any man @-@ made activity , but from natural phenomena such as large volcanic eruptions from __name1__ , and from __name2__ .
so the programs which model global warming in a computer say the temperature of the __name1__ 's lower atmosphere should be going up markedly , but actual measurements of the temperature of the lower atmosphere reveal no such pronounced activity .
in theory , one could argue that the computer models are accurate , and that the real measurements have some problem .
however this is not the case .
an incredible amount of work has been done to make sure that the satellite data are the best quality possible .
recent claims to the contrary by hurrell and __name1__ have been shown to be false for a number of reasons , and are laid to rest in the __month1__ __day1__ th edition of __name2__ ( page __value1__ ) .
the temperature measurements from space are verified by __quant1__ direct and independent methods ....
__value1__ , the influence of a man @-@ made doubling of the amount of __name1__ in the atmosphere is small compared to the __name2__ 's natural cooling rate , on the order of only a percent .
second , there is a much more important greenhouse gas than __name1__ , namely water vapor .
water vapor over the __name1__ is extremely variable , both in space and in time .
third , the ways in which clouds and water vapor feed back and ultimately influence the temperature of the __name1__ are , at best , poorly understood .
fourth , while the whole __name1__ is indeed in a state that scientists describe as " radiative equilibrium , " where the incoming sunlight equals the outgoing infrared radiation to provide a roughly constant overall temperature , the surface is far from this radiative balance condition .
evaporation and convection processes in the atmosphere transport heat from the surface to the upper troposphere , where it can be much more efficiently radiated into space since it is above most of the greenhouse @-@ trapping water vapor .
so in short , it is this convective overturning of the atmosphere - poorly represented in computer models of global warming - that primarily determines the temperature distribution of the surface and upper troposphere , not radiation balance ."

could it be that the ocean is cooling ?
<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyid=88520025"> the mystery of global warming 's missing __name1__ : npr </a>
the mystery of global warming 's missing heat · by richard harris
stuart westmorland · oceans hold much more heat than the atmosphere can .
__name1__
there has been a very slight cooling , but not anything really significant , " __name1__ says .
so the buildup of heat on __name1__ may be on a brief hiatus . "
global warming does n't mean every year will be warmer than the last .
and it may be that we are in a period of less rapid warming .
in recent years , heat has actually been flowing out of the ocean and into the air .
this is a feature of the weather phenomenon known as __name1__ .
so it is indeed possible the air has warmed but the ocean has not .
but it 's also possible that something more mysterious is going on .
that becomes clear when you consider what 's happening to global sea level .
sea level rises when the oceans get warm because warmer water expands .
this accounts for about half of global sea level rise .
so with the oceans not warming , you would expect to see less sea level rise .
instead , sea level has risen about __quant1__ an inch in the past __quant2__ years .
that 's a lot .
__name1__ says some of this water is apparently coming from a recent increase in the melting rate of glaciers in __name2__ and __name3__ .
but in fact there 's a little bit of a mystery .
we can n't account for all of the sea level increase we 've seen over the last three or four years , " he says .
__quant1__ possibility is that the sea has , in fact , warmed and expanded — and scientists are somehow misinterpreting the data from the diving buoys .
but if the aquatic robots are actually telling the right story , that raises a new question : where is the extra heat all going ?
if you read the whole article he does n't sound like he knows if he is coming or going but that sounds about right .
lol ...
" global warming 's missing heat ".
that 's funny .
the real brains are more concerned about global cooling , and they are really concerned about it right now .
and physics has firmly established the absorbtion spectra of __name1__ .
and the fact that we have had rapid increases in __name1__ and __name2__ in the past , and the result , in every case , was rapid warming .
that the initial cause was trapp volcanics in no way changes the result , simply because now the cause is the activities of man .
like your stand on evolution , your talking points reveal a deep misunderstanding of how science is done , and how conclusions are reached .
you may want to examine what you do n't understand .
most of us understand science just fine in terms of how hypotheses are tested and how conclusions are reached..
i would say it is you that does not understand science .
it is n't science that you believe in or are practicing .
what you are practicing is faith in the religion that is agw .
after all you do n't really understand the science behind it as well as your cherry picked experts .
therefore it is simply a faith that you have that __quant1__ group of people is right and you have chosen to ignore the rest , much like a __name1__ only has faith in __name2__ ' and ignores budha or the spirits __name3__ 's believed in .
atmospheric __name1__ causes the __name2__ to retain heat .
this was proved experimentally in __year1__ .
we have increased atmospheric __name1__ by __value1__ % in the last __quant1__ years .
we are adding __quant1__ tons of __name1__ to the atmosphere every year .
if our atmosphere was that simple you would have your case made .
except our atmosphere is far from that simple .
it is truly laughable to watch you people trying to convince yourselves that you understand any of this when you obviously dont ' understand even basic concepts like what constitutes an actual correllation .
do yourself a favor , take a math class and learn how to derive a correct correlation co @-@ efficient , run __name1__ numbers over time with temperature over time and let us know what the number is .
then tell us if you have a case .
what we do know about you is that __value1__ and foremost you 're a died in the wool liberal .
global warming is a liberal religion .
that 's really why you believe in it .
not because you understand the science and certainly not because you 've evaluated the contradictory evidence .
why is __name1__ hotter than __name2__ ?
because __name1__ has no atmosphere to speak of .
now you dishonest prick , explain how __quant1__ planets with atmoshpheres nothing like __name1__ even comes close to proving your point .
i challenge you to ask any scientist if he would find credible such a ridculous analogy as this one .
the scope of differing variables between __name1__ is __name2__ is so broad as to render the two incomparable .
watching someone who thinks they 're so smart make comparisons that are so scientifically stupid is truly amusing .
yeah .
let 's nationalize energy so that the same people who are granting waivers from __name1__ to their pals can rig the distribution and pricing so that the well connected get plentiful bargains and the rest of us are screwed .
energy makes the world go around , especially in todays society .
electricity is a must have if you intend on living in the __name1__ , with the notable exception of the __name2__ .
let it be said though that even the __name1__ are having a hard time fitting in and are moving further and further west .
we use electricity for a wide variety of essential everyday needs from running our refridgerators ( food ) , heating our homes ( shelter ) , providing lights so we can operate and function around the clock , and to run our televisions ( information gathering ) .
wether you have electricity or not determines what type of society you live in such as in the industrial world , or the __value1__ world .
the question to ask yourself is ...
can __quant1__ live for over __quant1__ year without electricity ?
every post cataclysmic scenerio puts man back __quant1__ if not longer because of the lack of electricity , society crumbles without it .
electricity comes from a variety of sources , water , wind , solar , nuclear , and fosil fuels .
oil being the most versitile of the lot is the most coveted .
our society has entwined itself with oil and has become so dependant on it that without it we would not last very long .
oil provides the means to do everything from transportation to production to providing electricity , and to heating our homes ( along with natural gas ) .
i believe it would be fair to put oil into the same catagory as electricity when it comes to it 's effect on society if it became absent .
society would crumble .
though it would be easier to get by without oil than electricity the effects would be very comparable .
let it be noted that alot of our electricity comes from oil as well .
given the facts about electricity and oil and their effects and contributions to society i cannot understand how energy in the __name1__ has not been nationalized yet .
in todays day and age with speculators and oil companies record setting profits how is it that this is allowed to continue ?
i would put forth that in the intrests of the population our energy should be produced , maintained , and provided by our government to ensure an affordable price to all .
now wether the government hires independant contractors to help with this or not would remain to be seen .
would this make us a __name1__ society ?
absolutely .
would this be a difficult transition ?
would this be beneficial to the population as a whole ?
would the oil fat cats and energy mongers fight this tooth and nail ?
without question , yes .
in the quest for energy independance i feel that it is a must that we nationalize our energy sector .
to leave it up to individuals to do what is right has not proven to be the answer ( greed ) , leaving it up to __name1__ has also proven not to be the answer ( free market system / capitalism ) , and leaving it up to government regulations ( politics ) is not the answer either .
even dealing with __name1__ has proven not to work ( foreign policy ) .
we as a nation of free people need to re @-@ evaluate our energy situation before we are no longer a free people .
this i believe is what our government was created to do , protect us from enemies foriegn and domestic , and to maintain a fair and level playing field for all .
we are already part way there , we maintain a standing army and now we must follow up with a nationalized energy policy to ensure our way of life , our civilization can survive and thrive .
it 's funny how you say we 'll lose our freedom if we do n't give up our freedom .
where have i heard something like that before ... ?
oh , yeah --
war is peace .
ignorance is strength .
freedom is slavery .
so , to answer your question , no.
not happening .
it is very important for our future .
__name1__ is a failure .
some things that governmenht do , they do very well .
i do not think that nationaling the assets of oil compnaies is remotely a good idea , though .
there might be __quant1__ way to test that theory , though . , and no nationalization of private peroperty is necessary
the __name1__ still owns plenty of land and offshore locations where there 's oil .
instead of selling the right to drill to a private company , let the government try to set up its own oil company .
i suspect that the oil won't be brought up out of the ground any more chearply than the private companies do it .
by nationalizing , the prices would absolutely go , down because if we the people being the govenment decide that oil needs to break even and the government does n't need to make a profit then the price will definitally go down .
gas will become cheaper when it comes to the profit margin .
oil without question is the lifeblood of our economy and thus society .
far too important to be left in the hands of an inept government .
the government does n't have a profit motive .
they do n't care whether they make a profit , break even , or go in the red .
they will simply spend the entire budget allocation on oil production and whether or not its financially efficient will be of no concern to them because another budget will be passed with another allocation in the future .
funding would come from tax dollars , which are theoretically available forever .
so if money is lost producing oil , who cares , there 's money available forever .
as long as oil is being provided , right ?
you could always assume that people would keep the system running properly through their due diligence and their vote , but i do n't see that happening anywhere else with government spending so why think it would be different with government @-@ run oil production ?
op killer right there .
not really .
and it sort of supports the op..
although that 's not the intention .
i 'd go out on a limb and say the oil industry is already nationalized .
it 's become pretty obvious now that the government will financially back stop big companies in the event that they face bankruptcy .
so if __name1__ makes a bunch of stupid mistakes and loses their ass , our tax dollars will prop them up anyway .
this way , we do n't actually have to call it nationalization .
nonsense .
^ this ...
but then ...
what 's that __name1__ referred to as the perfect merger between the corporation and the state ?
would it ?
are you absolutely sure about that ?
why ?
show us the numbers and how the government would insure that there was enough energy and how they would fairly share it .
<a __name1__ the doe just made a __value1__ loan guarantees . </a>
it usually takes a few posts before someone invokes __name1__ , congratulations on doing it on the __value1__ post .
the government was created because idiots like you wanted power to be concentrated in the hands of a select few and no one wanted to see that happen here .
congratulations on becoming the enemy you are calling on the government to fight .
my guess is that it will not only be more expensive , it will actually take longer to drill , and end up being more harmful to the environment .
cfls will actually cut down on mercury pollution produced by coal burning , and __name1__ agrees .
" by using less electricity , cfls help reduce mercury emissions from coal @-@ burning power plants , which are the largest source of human @-@ caused mercury emissions in the __name1__ , " said agency press officer ernest jones .
( related : " clean coal ?
new technology buries greenhouse emissions " [ __month1__ __day1__ , 2006].)
and nuclear power would produce all the emission free electricity we need without having to use mercury for light bulbs .
" recycling programs are already in place in many areas , " noted mercury clean @-@ up expert hogue .
" community leaders do n't need to reinvent the wheel ."
if recycling is not possible , used cfls should be sealed inside a plastic bag and taken to a household hazardous waste disposal site , just as should batteries , oil @-@ based paint , and motor oil , __name1__ recommends .
web sites such as earth 911 and light recycle can provide local disposal options .
oh .....
then mercury is a problem .
nuclear is part of the solution .
its not the whole solution .
it has a byproduct that is very dangerous .
wouldnt you like to see an alternative developed that did not give any other countrys the ability to have this byproduct which can be turned into a bomb ?
yes just like old paint
so ...
in an effort to save the planet we 're using bulbs that are now deemed hazardous waste ?
that 's smart .
you fuckers slay me .
did n't __name1__ and __name2__ run on coal and nucular ?
fear mongering .
i want a stable energy supply that does not need ever increasing taxpayer subsidies so it can pretend to run profitably .
large scale wind is not profitable and is a blight on the landscape .
yet , we have replaced the " old paint " with non toxic paint ....
no ?
and we have replaced non @-@ toxic bulbs with toxic bulbs .
ok ...
i get it .
<a href="http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/05/070518-cfls-bulbs.html"> fluorescent lights ' mercury poses dim threat </a>
that is right wing propaganda .
the amounts in each bulb is tiny and presents no dangers
incandescent bulbs have none .
they 're all i use and all i will ever use .
that 's what i use .
no mercury , dangerous chemicals .
i 've worked with mercury and it 's dangerous , especially the vapors .
yeah , gotta a love a bulb that when dropped you have to open all the windows and leave the house .
you can bet your last dime that when there are no more non toxic bulbs , the environmentalists will come out and start on removing the fluorescent lighting .
defies all logic and the new mercury bulbs are hazardous to the environment .
guess i should start buying candles ....
to find out all we have to do is ask __name1__ and remember that __name2__ voted to the left of sanders while in the __name3__ .
__name1__ help us all if __name2__ ever got to appoint a liberal inflationist __name3__ chairman .
__name1__ did appoint a __name2__ chairman , youi blithering idiot .
it was __name1__ ....
the same guy who worked for baby __name1__ .
if i said he did n't i 'll pay you $ __quant1__ .
bet or run away once again with your liberal tail between your legs .
and using __name1__ as the standard for __name2__ is just ignorant .
hence my response to the o/p .
why ignorant given that bo had __quant1__ __name1__ parents , is for single payer , and voted to the left of __name2__ ? ?

there 's a world of better terms to describe this .....
~s~
if so why be afraid to tell us what they are
not really .
no economic theory , more inflammatory name calling , ...
the use of metaphor in place of actual reasoning .
you 'd get along real well with edward .
of course everyone who has gotten as far as college knows that monetary stimulus is artifical and so creates mal @-@ investment or bubbles that burst and cause recessions .
everyone who has gotten as far as college knows that monetary stimulus is artifical and so creates mal @-@ investment or bubbles that burst and cause recessions .
nope ....
quite a few of us got to and through college with the belief that monetary stimulus can provide a market for goods not yet produced .....
that might be the reasoning for the " stimulus " part of the term " monetary stimulus ".
maybe try going to college and getting an economics degree before telling other people what " everybody who has gotten as far as college " knows ?
so then why be so afraid to tell us the basis for your liberal belief ? ?
you 've taken econ 101 .
i 'm sure you 're well versed in how shocks to monetary velocity that are n't offset , combined with nominal rigidities , can cause unnecessary recessions .
no idea what point you thought you were making .
do you have any idea ? ?
what it is is monetary central planner witch doctors , like those at the __name1__ , trying to tell us that you really can push strings .
what the fuck are you talking about ?
you think __name1__ was a central planner witch doctor ?
he worked with and enabled some of the greatest authoritarian economic witch doctors of all time , including __name1__ ....
in fact one of friedman 's greatest regrets is that he foisted income tax withholding upon the nation .
unlike some , i do n't consider __name1__ to be an economic demi @-@ god .
__name1__ was a lead in the __name2__ boys economics .
think __name1__ ...
pinochet , anyone .
in other words , yes , __name1__ was for central planning in monetary policy .
__name1__ was too .
he himself said his theories would work best under authoritarian style governments .
shocker , he was right .
what most all modern day economists have in common is they believe in the control @/@ plan model of economics .
there is a concensus that economics is a hard science , when it is not .
in order to prove their a priori values correct in mathematics , they must eventually succumb to controlling it all .
economics is a human action and can not be quantified in natural science .
monetarists have some things right , but fall right into the planning trap .
the point is that since you 're so keen on telling everybody to go to college and constantly informing us of your immense understanding of econ 101 , you should know better than anybody the basis you were asking for .
no point in sucking eggs .
__name1__ was n't for central planning at all .
he ideally wanted free banking .
the point of monetarism was that given that central banks exist , which is n't to say that they should , they should be constrained by binding rules and have any discretion taken away from them .
strange to call that being " for central planning ".
but that 's part and parcel of the whole libertarian @/@ anarchist internet culture .
anybody that holds opinions based on contingencies that occur in reality rather than constantly pounding the same extreme views is a " statist ".
problem with __name1__ is that he failed to recognize what basiat did in " the law "...
that given the choice between work and plunder , most people would choose the latter ...
which exposes the fatal conceit of monetarists : they actually believe that you can put imperfect humans in charge of the money supply without them rigging the game to benefit themselves and their friends .
i sure you 're well versed in the fact that you still can n't push a rope .
false analogy .
it 's the entire underlying premise of economic central control in general and __name1__ economics in particular .
fluffing that flawed premise with a flurry of incomprehensible semantics can n't change the fact .
and now we have a strawman .
is there any fallacy you won't invoke ?
he advised pinochet only about how to manage monetary policy .
in fact , he gave him the same advice he gave our presidents .
he said that ?
then why be so afraid to prove it ?
and your best example of this would be ? ?
so i take it you 're not at all familiar with __name1__ or monetarism then .
he wanted a k @-@ percent rule so that a computer could control the money supply .
the entire point was removing human discretion from monetary policy .
no strawman at all ....
i know bullshit semantics when i hear them ...
i 'm well trained and versed in the practice .
amongst the biggest bullshitters on the planet are neo @-@ keynesian economists and their kissing cousin __name1__ monetarists .
a matter of weeks after screwing the pooch in __name2__ __name1__ is doing what __quant1__ knew he would do even before he was elected .
__name1__ just spent __quant1__ years rebuilding the military and __name2__ like the liberal he is decimates it .
if a __name1__ wins in __month1__ the cycle will repeat itself .
__name1__ wants us to think the threats are gone .
actually __name1__ is proving they 're worse .
however , __name1__ has a plan .
gut the military to pay for his social programs and then hope nobody starts anything with whatever resources we have left .
today we were told not to talk about our opinions on this matter while at work .
sounds like the orders we received when i was still on a team .
do n't bad @-@ mouth the ignorant sob or face charges .
screw it .
an __name1__ and a n __name2__ are sitting in this bar and the the american turns to the guy and asks " __name3__ il 's son is now your leader " he says sarcasticly .
" how can you put someone with zero leadership expirience in charge of your military ? ?"
the n __name1__ turns to him and says with a grin " you should talk ......
at least our president is n't afraid of victory ".
" facts are stubborn things " - __name1__
i do n't suppose it occured to you to provide us with some empirical evidence to support this charge of yours , did it ?
__name1__ ’s $ __quant1__ budget calls for military spending increases and deep cuts to social service programs
__name1__ href="http://www.democracynow.org/2011/2/15/obamas_37_trillion_budget_calls_for"> obama </a>
of course __name1__ did nothing with __name2__ 's budget because theer was n't enough of a free ride for the rich in his plan .
i wrote on here when __name1__ was named secdef that he was sent there to dismantle the place .
military end @-@ strength goes way down during __name1__ administrations .
no surprise here .
this time it will be worse .
they are going after pay , retirement , and health care benefits .
not cool mr. prez .
remember the __name1__ budget that cut money to the va ?
during his wars while the wounded were still rolling in .
i do remember .
i have no problems with the increased funding for the va , tbi treatment , ptsd , veteran unemployment initiatives , and other such efforts by the current administration .
i also have applauded the __value1__ lady and __name1__ for their pro @-@ miltary platform .
my comments are concerning the maintenence of a strong military and the career designated personnel that operate it .
i 've lived throught the bad years and the good ones and prefer the good ones .
i 'm not whining about losing my benefits as they can n't touch my __quant1__ retirement check except for the __quant2__ cola .
they can and probably will mess with my health care , although i do n't mind a modest increase in premiums .
__name1__ funding and dod monies come from different pots .
man this is the worst time for this , we need our military to be in its best shape right now .
yeah because we gotta kill them brown people , they 're taking over !
not what i said ass wipe .
most of the expense of the rebuild went to new equipment , new armored vehicles , fuel for ships and planes , upgrades on garrison facilities .
now all of that will go to waste .
civilian job positions are n't being filled .
new facilities needing maintainance are already falling into decay .
there is only so much fat you can trim from an already lean fighting force .
but __name1__ thinks he can bullshit us into thinking he 'll make the military better .
he just wants something smaller and less expensive .
he wants to turn us into a second @-@ rate world power .
none of his flowery words will prevent that .
are you fucking serious ?
" lean "?
we spend more money on our military than the next __quant1__ largest militaries combined .
thats because of our cost of living expenses .
we pay our troops and civilian employees @/@ contractors a hell of a lot more than other countries .
all the equipment it uses is much more expensive as well since most of it is manufactured here .
yet many countries have far a bigger military ( troop size ) than the __name1__ .
my son is a sgt in the army , ft __name1__ .
we spent __name1__ with him and his family , and he talked about __name2__ wanting to cut their pay .
he 's been to __name1__ 3 times , and now training in __name2__ .
they should never cut the pay of our military .
they risk their lives for __name1__ ....
__name1__ want 's our country to die ....
and our great leader want 's it too .
of course odumber wants to cut the pay or make people get out with __quant1__ years in so they do not get their retirement or medical benefits they worked so hard for .
so he has money for his pet projects and the people in __name1__ get their pay raises
yeah thats true we do spend more than the next __quant1__ largest militaries combined .
but if i am not mistaken we protect far more interests and humanitarian aid is included in the dod budget .
also at a time where soldiers are averaging multiple deployments in their __value1__ __quant1__ years i dont think a troop reduction is really called for .
maybe a war reduction __value1__ then we can talk about cutting troops .
but positioning another battle fleet by __name1__ while the tentative outcasting of __name3__ troops by __name2__ has left over 23000 soldiers in __name4__ plus more in neighboring countries because nobody believes we will be gone long does not signal a promising end to wars in the __name5__ .
why would we shift our views to __name1__ ie __name2__ and __name3__ when they pose no threat and our naval and air superiority are not in question ?
i love it when liberals claim they " care " about the military .
fucking laughable .
we need to expand and take better care of our military , not gut it and decrease it , not having enough troops on the ground in __name1__ and __name2__ is why things got so fucked up in those places to begin with , we did n't have enough troops to everywhere we needed to be to provide security and we left pockets of those countries open for the insurgents to control .
with the end of __name1__ most elements of the military were slightly pared down , but not as would have normally occured because of the ongoing __name2__ with __name3__ .
__name1__ started a a major gut of the military and intelligence capabilities after the __name3__ ( supposedly ) ended which was continued ( and accelerated ) under __name2__ .
__name1__ @/@ __name1__ and all subsequent actions afterwards dramatically increased the military and intelligence communities and now that 's winding down the paring starts all over again .
we have always followed this route , hell after the __name1__ the federal army alone went from __quant1__ men to __quant2__ almost overnight .
the same growth , paring process happened with __name2__ , __name2__ and __name1__ .

__quant1__ __name1__ , __quant2__ __name2__ killed in helicopter crash
by solomon moore · __name1__
__name3__ , afghanistan ( __name2__ ) -- a military helicopter crashed in eastern afghanistan , killing __quant1__ __name1__ special operation troops and __quant2__ afghan commandos , the country 's president said saturday .
an __name1__ official said it was apparently shot down , in the deadliest single incident for american forces in the decade @-@ long war .
the __name1__ claimed they downed the helicopter with rocket fire while it was taking part in a raid on a house where insurgents were gathered in the province of __name2__ late friday .
it said wreckage of the craft was strewn at the scene .
__name1__ confirmed the overnight crash took place and that there " was enemy activity in the area ."
but it said it was still investigating the cause and conducting a recovery operation at the site .
it did not release details or casualty figures .
" we are in the process of accessing the facts , " said __name2__ __name1__ capt. justin brockhoff , a __name3__ spokesman .
but a senior __name1__ administration official in __name2__ said it was apparently shot down by insurgents .
the official spoke on condition of anonymity because the crash is still being investigated .
president __name1__ mourned the deaths of the __name2__ troops , saying in a statement that the crash serves as a reminder of the " extraordinary sacrifices " being made by the __name3__ military and its families .
he said he also mourned " the __name1__ who died alongside our troops ."
the death toll would surpass the worst single day loss of life for the __name1__ @-@ led coalition in __name2__ since the war began in __year1__ - the __month1__ __day1__ , __year2__ downing of a military helicopter in eastern __name3__ province .
in that incident , __quant1__ __name1__ and __name2__ special operations troops were killed when their craft was shot down while on a mission to rescue __quant2__ seals under attack by the __name3__ .
__quant1__ of the __name1__ being rescued were also killed and the __value1__ wounded .
it was the highest __quant1__ @-@ day death toll for the __name1__ personnel since __name2__ .
with its steep mountain ranges , providing shelter for militants armed with rocket @-@ propelled grenade launchers , eastern __name1__ is hazardous terrain for military aircraft .
large , slow @-@ moving air transport carriers like the __name1__ @-@ __name1__ are particularly vulnerable , often forced to ease their way through sheer valleys where insurgents can achieve more level lines of fire from mountainsides .
__name2__ president __name1__ on saturday gave the __value1__ public word of the new crash , saying in a statement that " a __name3__ helicopter crashed last night in __name4__ province " and that __quant1__ __name5__ special operations troops were killed .
he expressed his condolences to president __name1__ .
the helicopter was a twin @-@ rotor __name1__ , said an official at __name2__ headquarters in __name3__ .
the official , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said he was receiving his information from an __name1__ officer in __name2__ .
the crash took place in the __name1__ district of __name2__ province , said a provincial government spokesman , shahidullah shahid .
the volatile region borders the province of __name1__ where the __name2__ capital is located and is known for its strong __name3__ presence .
__name2__ spokesman __name1__ said in a statement that __name2__ fighters downed the helicopter during a " heavy raid " in __name3__ .
he said __name1__ attacked a house in __name2__ where insurgent fighters were gathering friday night .
during the battle , the fighters shot down the helicopter , killing __quant2__ __name1__ and __quant3__ __name2__ , he said , adding that __quant1__ insurgents were killed in the fight .
there have been at least 17 coalition and __name1__ aircraft crashes in afghanistan this year .
most of the crashes were attributed to pilot errors , weather conditions or mechanical failures .
however , the coalition has confirmed that at least one __name1__ @-@ __name1__ helicopter was hit by a rocket propelled grenade on __month1__ __day1__ .
__quant1__ coalition crew members were injured in that attack .
meanwhile , in the southern __name3__ province , an __name1__ government official said saturday that __name2__ troops attacked a house and inadvertently killed __quant1__ members of a family , including women and children .
__name1__ said that __name2__ fighters fired rocket propelled grenades and small arms fire at coalition troops during a patrol friday in the __name3__ district .
" coalition forces responded with small arms fire and as the incident continued , an air strike was employed against the insurgent position , " said brockhoff .
he added that __name1__ sent a delegation to meet with local leaders and investigate the incident .
__name1__ district police chief shadi khan said civilians died in the bombardment but that it was unknown how many insurgents were killed .
__name1__ , a __name2__ stronghold , is the deadliest province in __name3__ for international troops .
__name1__ has come under harsh criticism in the past for accidentally killing civilians during operations against suspected insurgents .
however , civilian death tallies by the __name1__ show the insurgency is responsible for most war casualties involving noncombatants .
in south __name2__ , __name1__ said two coalition service member were killed , __quant1__ on friday and another on saturday .
the international alliance did not release further details .
with the casualties from the helicopter crash , the deaths bring to 365 the number of coalition troops killed this year in __name1__ and 42 this month .

poor souls
__quant1__ coalition troops killed this year ?
man , that 's a lot .
i did n't realize the casualties were that high this year .
our msm does n't seem very interested in covering the __name1__ war much .
i 'm really not sure why .
that 's bad but this is the unnecessary war __name1__ started .
this is war and people die in wars .
over one million __name2__ deaths caused by __name1__ occupation
<a href="http://www.projectcensored.org/top-stories/articles/1-over-one-million-iraqi-deaths-caused-by-us-occupation/"> #1 . over __name2__ million iraqi deaths __name1__ by us occupation | project censored </a>
it was reported on the __name2__ that the special ops were __name1__ team 6 ...
the same team that got __name1__ .
a real national tragedy .
i do n't know if there is one already but i propose a very public memorial erected for these best of the best and bravest of the brave that have fallen .
yes , i just heard that too ...
for christs sake ...
rip .
the anti @-@ military left has some diehards in __name1__ that are pissed at obama for not surrendering to __name2__ , but many of the left @-@ wing goons put down their pitchforks because they feel protesting obama will hurt their overall __name3__ agenda with non @-@ military issues .
they are willing to sit on their hands for __name1__ in order to ruin our economy and society .
if this happened on __name3__ 's watch we would have anti @-@ war protestors on tv and marching around the __name1__ , but not a peep with the " holy one " sitting in the __name2__ .
there won't be a pr tv moment for __name1__ with this news story connected to __name2__ .
this is true .
i 've always said the " __name1__ @-@ __name1__ " are by far the biggest frauds in __name2__ .
where are all those ' human shields ' they sent over to save __name1__ ?
not seeing them being sent over to save ole __name1__ huh ?
why not ?
do the math .
it 's all about that ' d ' & ' r ' thing for these people .
wow .
if true , this is shocking in so many ways .
how were the __name1__ able to locate and kill this team ?
it seems like it had to be an inside job .
the __name1__ had to be involved .
i do n't believe in coincidences .
they report it every day , but there 's not much to report since reporters are n't allowed in many of these operations .
we do n't want __name1__ or some other reporter drawing attack plans in the sand again , do we ?
another idiot ....
" __name1__ started this war ."
yeah , __name1__ was behind __name2__ @/@ __name2__ , right ?
oh , it was only __name1__ that wanted to get back at those behind __name2__ @/@ __name2__ .
liberals were n't claiming __name1__ was the " legit " war during the __year1__ election ?
you asshole just make things up week to week trying to look smart .
how many of the dead were draftees ?
or even better , when are they going to __name1__ to protect the people there ?
no flotillas for the mass slaughter victims in __name1__ or __name2__ ?
you want to laugh at what hypocritical , racist trash the far @-@ left anti @-@ war scumbags are , check out __name1__ 's site , there is not a fucking word mentioning __name2__ .
or even better , call the __name1__ @/@ marxist lowlifes at __name4__ , the other fucking trash __name2__ @-@ allied group that made a name for itself fighting __name3__ " and his wars ."
ask them why they are not protesting the war crimes the syrian regime is committing in __name1__ , and they 'll manufacture every bs nonsense excuse in the book .
what are you babbling about now ?
draft ?
i do recall __name1__ wanted a stupid draft ...
yes it does seem that seal team 6 has been decimated in this attack .
how did this happen ?
how did the __name1__ know where to find these guys ?
this smells of an inside job for sure .
__name1__ had to be involved in revealing the location of this chopper .
a slight disagreement .
the war in __name1__ was completely necessary .
if a mistake was made there , it was when the __name1__ administration diverted our military forces to __name2__ in __year1__ before the __name3__ war as wrapped up .
now we are almost having to start over again there .
it is important that we do the job right so we do n't have to go back in 5 or 10 years .
not trying to be disrespectful at all , but ...
my dad was in the __name1__ .
he said it was his way of draft dodging during __name1__ .
but he did boot camp , served , swabbed the deck , carried a weapon , arrested people for illegal fishing , stuff like that .
he still whistles the __name1__ tune .
__name2__ not actually in the __name1__ ...
it was part of the __name1__ (!) and now , __name2__ .
i trust the __name1__ is rough and ready .
they guarded me every time i went to work across __name1__ !
but honestly , if someone is trying to be a bad @-@ ass , i figure they go for the __name1__ , __name3__ 's __name2__ or __name4__ , etc. if not , well , __name5__ .
though i knew a guy who joined the __name1__ so he could join their rescue team , reputed to be pretty incredible .
personally , i did n't finish __name1__ .
just thought it was cool that __quant1__ of them are __name1__ .
highly unique military circumstance .
interservice rivalry aside , the __name1__ has some jobs that are as tough as any special operations duty , and can get you killed , whether you get shot at , or not .
the __name1__ school has a typical attrition rate exceeding __value1__ % , and it would n't surprise me if some of them were able to get through __name2__ and become seals.; a lot of the mental and physical skills required are similar .
the __name1__ has about 300 rescue swimmers deployed world wide , and you 'd be surprised at some of the things they do routinely .
( it sure includes some things this former airborne infantry grunt would not particularly care to attempt .)
you gotta wonder why joyce would disrespect his own father 's service .
things might have changed but as recent as the late 90 s if you were from another branch of service and completed all the training you had to resign from that service and join the __name1__ in order to be a __name2__ team member .
__name1__ rescue swimmers are as bad ass as they come .

okay , this apparently is the pov you hold .
the rest of the post you made contains the regrets and hindsight of men and women involved in the decision to use the a @-@ bomb on __name1__ ....
and i have no trouble believing they carried a powerful sense of conflict and regret over that choice till they died .
they would not have been human if they did not .
i seem to recall even __name1__ regretted invention of the a @-@ bomb .
but emotion alone does not control the questions of ethics and the a @-@ bomb .
personally i think it is irrelevant whether or not __name1__ had a " superior economic @/@ political system " to the __name2__ 's in __year1__ .
i do n't happen to believe that they did , but either side in a war seeks conquest .
i like to think at least some military people place ethical limits on their warfare behavior .
in that vein , what i am asking is this :
* was the a @-@ bomb a useful weapon ?
did the war end faster because we unleashed it on __name1__ ?
* why was it necessary to drop __quant1__ a @-@ bombs ?
and most urgently :
* did humans learn anything from the a @-@ bombing of __name1__ that military types today can or should reflect upon before firing off the nuclear weapons in their arsenals ?
ill bet your dad was relieved it was over .
if __name1__ had not dropped it and he ( your dad ) died then your family found he had a weapon that could have ended it , they would have wanted truman drawn and quatered .
also you would n't be here today !!!!
the jap army did not believe we had more that __quant1__ weapon .
also they were starving their own people to stay in the fight .
__name1__ generals did not believe we had more than one a @-@ bomb ?
that seems incredible ...
almost suicidal .
if i were __name1__ , i 'd be hating on those generals .
civilians should not be cannon fodder without reason .
is n't surrender required ( ethically ) when civilian lives are at stake ?
yeah , we should drop the bomb on those with whom we are no longer at war .
the japs were more brutal than the __name1__ 's

would anyone like to correct his error in thinking ?
i could explain about learning from history , but i do n't think si modo can take in any data from chicks .
__name1__ based his decision on the actions of the __name2__ at __name3__ , __name4__ , and __name5__ .
civilian casualties were respectively __value1__ % , __value2__ % and __value3__ % .
__name1__ casualties , while lower than __name2__ casualties , were severe and the battles protracted .
__name1__ is a very small rock , but it took __quant1__ months to clear .
they were budgeting __quant1__ __name1__ deaths per square mile .
i have no problem with using the bomb to end it .
the original target was __name1__ because there was good reason to believe the germans would come up with the bomb if we did n't .
( the were too pig headed and blinded by ideology to do so , lucky for us ) it was in __name1__ that the __value1__ big breakthroughs came .
i think the __name1__ project was a waste of resources .
they should have spent the resources more wisely .
but having built it , and given the goofiness and intransigence of the __name1__ government , using it was the best way to end the war .
the japs were trying to build their own abomb .
what if they had suceeded ? ??

__name1__ is running its series " __name2__ " now , and i can hardly bear to watch .

the __name1__ did not engage in systematic genocide with their army .
i know -- a little -- about things such as the __name1__ .
thank __name1__ , daddy was not a pow and came home in __quant1__ piece , at least physically .
but are you really saying the __name1__ deserved brutality from the __name2__ in a way that the __name3__ did not ?
it 's just hard to imagine any human evil will ever rival the __name1__ .
__name2__ pows were treated well by the __name1__ .
they didn't ' go on suicide missions , and they would surrender .
what was happening to the __name1__ was separate from other war efforts , which the german soldiers likely did n't even know about while they were fighting the war .
__name1__ tortured and abused pows , if not straight up kill them .
they killed and brutalized so many civilians in the lands they captured .
they were by far much more fucked up than the germans .
holocaust aside
in the context of the time and the number of people who had already been killed on both sides , i would say the __value1__ bomb was ethical to end the war .
i still can n't understand why it was necessary to drop a __value1__ bomb only __quant1__ days later .
we had already made our point with __name1__ ...
__name1__ was overkill
read the source documents .
after the __value1__ bomb the generals that ran the government refused to surrender .
the emperor refused to act after the __value1__ bomb also .
it is all there .
the __value1__ bomb is what convinced the emperor to order a surrender .
retiredgysgt , in a rather lazy fashion repeatedly points to __name1__ 's collection of __quant1__ documents on the atomic bomb and end of __name2__ 2 saying ' the proof is in there '.
rather like tossing a dictionary at a newspaper editor and saying ' here 's tomorrow 's front page story '.
so where in the comprehensive __quant2__ lengthy sections could that magical , much sought @-@ after golden fleece @-@ like ' good reason ' to consign the __quant1__ civilian population of __name1__ and the 250.000 civilian population of __name2__ to the horrors of a nuclear blood bath be hiding ?
perhaps it was document 29 , where on __day1__ of __month1__ foreign minister __name1__ sent the following ' extremely urgent ' message to ambassador __name2__ :
" we are now secretly giving consideration to the termination of the war because of the pressing situation which confronts __name1__ both at home and abroad therefore , when you have your interview with __name3__ [ in accordance with previous instructions ] you should not confine yourself to the objective of a rapprochement between russia and __name2__ but should also sound him out on the extent to which it is possible to make use of __name4__ in ending the war ."
and then on the same day :
__name1__ @- as a proposal for ending the war and because of her concern for the establishment and maintenance of lasting peace - has absolutely no idea of annexing or holding the territories which she occupied during the war ."
__value1__ href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsaebb/nsaebb162/29.pdf"> http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsaebb/nsaebb162/29.pdf </a>
these documents reveal many desperate attempts by japans envoys to establish a surrender up to the very end and on __month1__ __day1__ th ( document 52 ) .
all the while __name1__ interceptors secretly listened in , and made __name2__ 's office aware of the full content of these __name3__ attempts yet they went ahead anyway , choosing to test __quant1__ of each type of their new atomic devices , __value1__ uranium , then plutonium on the living human __name4__ pigs ; the old men , the helpless women and innocent children behind enemy lines , away from the theatre of war , away from where the soldiers were .
__name1__ sneaked in , from a safe height and in cowards fashion dropped their devastating bombs on non combatants then ran away .
and as president __name2__ ate his lunch on the __name5__ with fellow mass murderers __name3__ and __name4__ , news of the bombing of __name1__ came in . jubilantly , he announced to the retinue of sailors around him..
" this is the greatest thing in history ! "
( heaped bodies after __name1__ atomic @-@ bombing of civilian area .)
it has always bothered me that we bombed cities full of non @-@ whites , but not __name1__ , where the __name2__ existed .
maybe the a @-@ bomb was not finished before ve day .
maybe .
but the __name1__ confined japanaese americans to internment camps and did not do so as to __name2__ americans or __name3__ americans .
it seems to me there must have been a tremendous temptation to drop the a @-@ bomb someplace , just to show the world what we had .
without using it in warfare , who would ever believe this gruesome weapon even existed ?
all these things , together with the __value1__ bombing , have made me uneasy .
i want to believe __name1__ 's decisions were ethically defensible .
his comments to those around him do not offend me .
it 's understandable that he wanted vj day at any cost .
but still the doubts persist -- that we bombed a couple of __name1__ cities and killed millions , instantly or later by radiation poisoning , because we could and not because we had no other choice .
i do n't know what my daddy saw or knew .
i lost him when i was quite young , and like most ww __name1__ vets , he would never discuss what he 'd been through .
but my mommy and daddy were pinkos .
they sympathesized with or actually joined the __name2__ __name1__ .
i rather think if he 'd been all good with __name1__ 's decisions , daddy would not have been such a radical after the war .
waste of time on that asshat .
quartermass has not given opinion in that last post , namvet .
he recited facts .
either he has the facts right or he does n't .
if he 's right , what use is it to go on pretending it was all good ?
that 's the point .
no reply to back up what he says .
he 's using the ole copy and paste trick .
come on .
he 's a troll .
__value1__ thing .
the atomic bombs were not ready until summer __year1__ .
__name1__ surrendered in __month1__ .
we had no reason to drop said bombs on __name1__ .
the reality is that it took both bombs to get the emperor of __name1__ to over ride his army controlled government and order an immediate surrender .
with those bombs we would have starved __name1__ through the winter killing untold thousands followed by an invasion of a home island which would have seen millions of dead japanese civilians and soldiers .
__name1__ was teaching her civilians to arm themselves with bamboo spears and human wave charge any invasion .
the continued invasion of __name1__ could have seen the potential elimination of the japanese race .
the lie that __name1__ was ready to surrender is revisionist history .
__name1__ under the army had no intention of surrender .
what they " offered " through the __name4__ was a cease fire with __name1__ keeping everything she still possessed and the return of japanese home possessions like __name2__ and __name3__ .
__name1__ was offering to let us just stop attacking them .
they would retain all of their __name1__ , __name2__ and other possessions and we would return their home island captures .
here is a link to source documents verifying that __name1__ was not offering a meaningful surrender , that even after __value1__ atomic bombs the army controlled government refused to surrender , that the emperor failed to act until after the __value1__ atomic bomb and that the army attempted a coup to prevent the emperor from surrendering .
<a href="http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nsaebb/nsaebb162/index.htm"> the atomic bomb and the __name1__ war ii : a collection of primary sources </a>
the atomic bombs were necessary unless one thinks we should have just let __name1__ keep everything from before the war and not disarm .
they saved millions of lives .
you 're full of shit .
the proof is not in what you stated , it is what you completely avoided .
there are __quant1__ simple yet often overlooked fundamental aspects that prove the bombs were not meant to get __name1__ to surrender .
( 1 ) we had their offer to surrender before we dropped the bombs .
it was the same offer we accepted after we targeted civilians with the a @-@ bombs and dropped them .
( 2 ) the bombs were not dropped to intimidate __name1__ .
there were dropped to intimidate __name1__ .
midcan makes a good point .
if you are one of the dead , how it happened is no longer of any interest .
we did have the history of the way the __name1__ were fighting .
we were looking at civilian casualties in the range of __value1__ @-@ __value2__ % for the living on both sides , the bomb was a lifesaver .
but we are n't ever going to fight a war with an enemy like that again .
and we have never fought a war in that manner since .
the reasons the cliche " the bombs saved lives " are many of the same reasons __name1__ supporters were reduced to defending bush by saying " history will prove him correct ."
well , it 's been __quant1__ year .
what say you ?
he still seems like a lying fuckwhit to me .
and the sad thing is , while he lied about __name2__ having the a @-@ bomb , it now appears he failed to stop __name1__ from getting it .
oh joy .
it 's been a few years .
do we still need undiluted jingoism in everyone or else they 're a troll ?
__name1__ surrendered before the nukes were ready but even if that were not the case we would not have used them in __name3__ because __name2__ did not pose the same threat for post @-@ war in __name3__ as in __name4__ .
regarding death camps , we did n't bomb those because as a nation we were anti @-@ semitic to the point that many quietly thanked the implementation of the final solution .
we even turned away __name1__ refugees seeking asylum in the __name2__ who were eventually killed by __name3__ .
some claimed we did n't know about them and even if we knew we had no way to get bombers to their locations due to distance .
bullshit .
there are ariel photos showing we were bombing around the gas chambers .
there are __quant1__ main reasons we suddenly became pro @-@ __name1__ in __year1__ .
the __value1__ was creating a nation in the me the __name1__ could use as an entry point to resources in the region .
keep in mind , about __quant1__ generations before __name3__ the __name1__ created the nation of __name2__ .
literally , both by borders and name .
maintaining control was very difficult with so much geographical isolation .
enter __name1__ .
the __name1__ now has a geographical advantage but more importantly , it obtained a geopolitical goldmine that is still in use today .
the __name1__ had several negotiated settlements on the table .
none of them conformed to the conditions set out and agreed to by the allies .
curvelight , if this is the truth , then why has no bright lawyer ever sued the __name1__ on behalf of __name2__ for damages of one sort or another ?
you mean like we 've been paying off civilians in __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ etc ?
or like how __name1__ is paying off a @-@ bomb survivors ?
( not a typo--yes .
__name1__ has been paying a @-@ bomb survivors )
i would guess because it would n't get any traction .
a recent example is how a federal court rejected a lawsuit based on " national security ."
a __name2__ citizen was kidnapped by the __name1__ , taken to secret prisons , and tortured before it was discovered he was completely innocent .
his whole hellish nightmare lasted for months .
upon his release he sued the __name1__ for the above crimes and the case was dismissed for " national security reasons ."
without fact checking , i 'm confident in saying lawsuits have been attempted and denied .
the surrender offered by __name1__ prior to the bombs is the same surrender we accepted after the bombs .
and your full of it .
they refused any offer to surrender .
they were negotiating with __name1__ for one .
the bombs were dropped to end the war .
using science instead of __name1__ blood .
one of you is right and the other is wrong ...
on the facts .
is there no good source document to go look @-@ see who 's right , namvet ?
has there never been a proceeding in the __name1__ or any sort of international court ?
over 5000 __name1__ __name2__ were arrested and confined , several thousand were not released until __year1__ .
his facts support what i told you .
the __name1__ simply offered to end the war in place .
they would evacuate all territory captured after __month1__ __day1__ __year1__ and we would return all territory held by them prior to __month1__ __day1__ __year1__ .
that simply was not going to happen .
it is idiotic to think it would happen .
once again we did not have a functioning a bomb to drop on __name1__ before she surrendered and to tell you the truth we had no need to do so , they were not unreasonable fools like the __name2__ .
we did however firebomb most of their cities killing hundreds of thousands of civilians .
how about documents on this .
from the __name1__ archives .
there is no doc that says we offered or agreed to any surrender prior to the bombs .
it was still unconditional surrender !!!!
<a href="https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/bomb/large/index.php"> https://trumanlibrary.org/whistlesto...arge/index.php </a>
straight up lie .
provide a single source to your claim the __name1__ offered unconditional surrender before the emperor ordered it after __quant1__ atomic bombs .
i have in the source documents the actual meetings of the __name1__ government and their refusal to surrender after the __value1__ bomb and their refusal after the __value2__ until the emperor intervened .
__name1__ never claimed __name2__ had a bomb .
that is left wing lying at its finest .
as for stopping __name2__ , are you saying we were wrong for stopping __name1__ from returning to research on the bomb by invading but we should have invaded __name2__ ?
you are a liar .
provide a source document .
i have provided a source document of the __name1__ governments meetings and then did not offered to surrender at all before either bomb was dropped .
they offered through the __name1__ to end the war in place exchanging territory they captured for territory we captured .
after the __value1__ bomb they offered much the same .
provide us a link to a source document .
i gave you a link to source documents .
they include the __name1__ governments meetings involving just this .
read them .
after __name2__ leaders flatly rejected the __name3__ president __name1__ authorized use of the atomic bomb anytime after __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ .
<a href="http://www.trumanlibrary.org/teacher/abomb.htm#docanal"> atomic __name1__ @-@ truman press __month1__ __day1__ august __year1__ , 1945 </a>
this is what i mean .
either this is an accepted , established historical fact or it is n't .
we should n't be debating what happened .
i thought we knew what happened .
i 'm very confused by these different scenarios you guys present .
if we a @-@ bombed __name1__ needlessly , it was not ethical .
or was it ?
do we agree on that much ?
i say no.
even though we benefitted from the object lesson @/@ demonstration of __name2__ military power , the use of the a @-@ bomb -- twice -- just to flex our post @-@ war muscles was not ethical , if it was not also necessary to force __name1__ to surrender .
madeline there were millions of __name1__ lives at stake here .
you make the call .
kill the enemy or you own ? .
then you have to face the the suriving families .
who will call you a murderer .
which is it ? ???
personally , i do n’t think without the dramatic blow of the atomic drops many __name1__ military units would have surrendered even if the emperor had told them to .
the military often dictated terms to the government , they had large armies undefeated in __name1__ , mass killing civilians every day , they might have just fought on dragging the war out and costing everyone more life , ( an invasion of __name2__ would have cost far more life than the drops on both sides ) and allowing the __name3__ to expand their sphere of influence in __name4__ .
indeed there was a plot to __name2__ attack the surrender ceremony on the __name1__ that was stopped by the emperor ’s son , ( __name3__ , __name4__ ) so even after the drops there were hard core elements willing to fight on .
the drops ( __name1__ did not know how many more bombs we had ) made resistance of any kind almost unthinkable .
also , how does president __name1__ tell a parent your son died , even in a war prolonged by days or weeks , and i had a weapon that could have ended the war immediately but did not use it .
he could n’t .
the drops also certainly put a break on __name1__ ambitions , they had to think and be cautious about gobbling up territory in the direct post war chaos .
they probably stopped an immediate military conflict with the __name1__ .
agreed !!!!
ests were a __quant1__ __name1__ dead in the invasion .
ests were always wrong .
probably more like 3 or 4 times that number .
this weighed heavily on trumans mind .
drop em .
you are arguing the wrong point .
there was no surrender on the table before the a bombs were dropped .
the only thing the __name1__ offered was a cease of hostilities and the return of captured territory .
they would hand over what ever they still had from after __month1__ __day1__ and we would hand over what ever of theirs we had from before dec 7 .
it is a bald faced lie that the same surrender existed before as after and that we ignored it to bomb them .
my link is to source documents .
we have the actual conversations from the __name1__ government .
call me selfish , but if it saved even just __quant1__ __name1__ life , __quant1__ 'd have dropped the a @-@ bomb myself .
i am not asking for a pie @-@ in @-@ the @-@ sky ethical debate .
i merely want to know , was it necessary or not ?
had __name1__ surrendered before we bombed there ?
retiredgysgt says he can prove they did not , that he has source documents to back up his position .
well , is there any doubt that he does ?
is there some question about these documents ?
this is why there should have been a court proceeding .
i am just mystified as to why none was ever conducted .

i posted that link because it has a compilation from magic that tells a different story from the trumanesque romanticism of using the bombs .
apologists say it was necessary to use the bombs to get __name1__ to surrender unconditionally .
that 's bullshit because even after the bombs __name1__ did not give an unconditional surrender .
after using the bombs it was not __name1__ that compromised on the conditions of surrender .
it was the __name1__ .
think about it .

seems you do n't read what you post .
its obvious you deal in fiction and theories .
im finished with you
he is lying .
i have provided you with source documents .
the actual conversations that occurred in the __name1__ governments meetings about surrender , and after the a bombs .
the only thing the __name1__ offered before the a bombs was a cease fire to move their troops from captured territory while we removed our troops from captured territory .
we demanded an unconditional surrender just as we did in __name1__ .
the only concession we final relinquished on was allowing the emperor to remain the emperor .
go ahead , i have provided the actual conversations of the __name1__ government , he has offered nothing .
ask him for evidence .
you just admitted we accepted a conditional surrender from __name1__ .
if we were willing to accept a conditional surrender , the same one offered prior to the bombs , then why did n't we ?
here are some links for you to ignore :

dumb ass .
go argue your retarded lies somewhere else .
once again i have source documents of the japanese government and the __name1__ government .
the __name1__ never offered to surrender .
further the emperor surrendered unconditionally , we made the choice to allow him to remain emperor .
the fact you are either ignorant or dishonest about such a well known fact shows your gross inability to debate the issue .
__name1__ did not offer an unconditional surrender after the bombs :
" on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ , __name1__ offered to surrender to the __name2__ , the only condition being that the emperor be allowed to remain the nominal head of state ."
<a href="http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/surrender.htm"> http://www.cfo.doe.gov/me70/manhattan/surrender.htm </a>
retiredgysgt , i watched __name1__ on television saying that __name2__ had " weapons of mass destruction ".
i hoped he meant the a @-@ bomb ....
chemical and biological weapons of mass destruction scared me stiff .
he lied about that and sat around twiddling his thumbs whilst __name1__ acquired nuclear technology .
i despise __name1__ .
i think he and __name1__ should be arrested as traitors .
some of my friends have kidlets in active duty over in __name1__ and __name2__ ...
all because __name3__ __name1__ 's lies and __name2__ 's greed to score big contracts from the dept . __name3__ .
__name3__ href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmstchtuney"> __name1__ - __name2__ saddam hussein has weapons of mass destruction </a>
how can any patriot defend __name1__ ?
__name1__ was right .
according to everything we and the rest of the world knew __name1__ had biological and chemical weapons .
he never accounted for them and we knew he had them .
further his dual use facilities allowed him the ability to make more .
provide a single clip anywhere where __name1__ ever made a claim __name2__ had nukes .
you won't find one .
what we were worried about and rightfully so , was that __quant1__ sanctions were lifted he would only be a couple years away from a bomb .
captured documents prove that is true .
__name1__ nor __name2__ lied to anyone , that is left wing propaganda and outright lies .
read the __name1__ consent to use force .
__name1__ was very clear why we were going into __name2__ .
we have had __name1__ in control of both houses of __name2__ since __month1__ __year1__ , they promised if we elected them they would provide proof __name3__ lied and that he broke laws .
it is now __year1__ and no such charges have ever been brought forward .
in fact every commission __name1__ and __name2__ that investigated the issue has ruled __name3__ did not lie .
a quality debate on __name1__ would take some digging on my part -- flinging povs won't do any good without facts .
if you 'd like to , we can start a new thread on him .
i did n't mean to hijack this one..
i was enjoying the tutoring by you guys on __name1__ and __name2__ .
my apologies .
you 're quite the dumbass for ignoring what i said :
" i posted that link because it has a compilation from magic that tells a different story from the trumanesque romanticism of using the bombs ."
i do n't know and do n't care what else is on the site .
the information for magic is independently verifiable .
looks to me like you know you cannot defend your position so you seek a way out , however dishonest , rather than stand your ground .
__quant1__ still do not understand how such a hugely significant historical fact can be in doubt , this many years later .
curvelight : what exactly about retiredgysgt 's documents makes them less than reliable in your view ?
retiredgysgt : why are curvelight 's documents unreliable ?
are you claiming they have been altered ?
they are not authentic ?
what ?
you just cannot both be right on the facts .
it 's logically impossible .
he is playing with words .
the __name1__ made the following offer through the __name2__ ...
they would cease hostilities and we would cease hostilities .
they would evacuate all territory captured since __month1__ __day1__ __year1__ and we would evacuate all territory that was __name1__ before dec 7 1941 .
further no other action would occur to __name1__ .
no foreign presence in __name1__ , no reorganization of their government , no dismantling of their military .
we refused .
after the __value1__ atomic bomb they floated a similar plan and we again refused .
after the __value1__ bomb the emperor intervened in the governments deliberations .
the army which controlled the government absolutely refused to surrender .
even after __quant1__ atomic bombs .
the emperor over ruled them and ordered an immediate unconditional surrender .
curvelight is pretending that the offer to a cease of hostilities was a offer to surrender .
he is further claiming that because we eventually allowed the emperor to remain as a figure head in __name1__ we should not have dropped the bombs .
he is using the same intercepts as my source documents and claiming they do not clearly say what they say .
further i have in my source documents the actual meetings of the __name1__ government and what was and was not agreed to .
who wanted and did not want peace .
the army ran the government and was not going to surrender .
even after the emperor agreed to surrender the army staged a coup and tried to seize the voice recording where the emperor ordered the surrender and prevent the emperor from further addressing the nation .
well , curvelight , what say you ?
if retiredgysgt is right then the pov you and quartermass have posted here seems less than completely intellectually honest to me .
if retiredgysgt is correct on the facts , then as far as i am concerned , he is right on the ethics as well .
this business of flinging urls around is n't getting us anywhere , curvelight .
what exactly is defective about the documents relied on by retiredgysgt and namvet ?
why are they not good evidence of what transpired ?
are the doctored ?
are they incomplete ?
is there doubt about their authenticity ?
i just posted the evidence __name1__ did not offer an unconditional surrender but you want to claim i 'm ignorant of the facts ?
lol ...
no to all those questions .
he even uses magic intercepts for his claims .
he is twisting the information and in some cases outright lying .
but what is the point if you refuse to even read the documents ?
i have glanced through all the urls , sir .
each seems to support the factual allegations the posters have claimed they would .
but both scenarios cannot have occurred , and at this point , i am kinda sorta thinking this is as far as i 'm gonna get .
i 'm heavily inclined to believe what you have posted , retiredgysgt , but i still have some doubts .
more or less the same place i was in when this thread started .
the question of the bombs ' role was not in trying to figure out how to end ww2 .
they were used to figure out how to start what became known as the __name1__ .
oh yeah , that makes a lot of sense ......
you could not think of any better way to demonstrate what an idiot you are .
you 're one of many who lack basic knowledge about the end of ww2 .
the bombs were used to prevent __name1__ from surrendering through a deal with __name2__ .
why ?
the __name1__ would have had to share the spoils of war and we were not about to do that .
also , we were never really allies with __name1__ as our only common goal was defeating the __value1__ __name2__ in __name3__ .
but feel free to continue calling people an idiot because they say something beyond your comprehension capabilities .
it makes you look oh so cool !
excusatio non petita , accusatio manifesta
shircia , fov huzy deramia !
once again you fucking moron i have the meetings from the __name1__ government .
they were never going to surrender to the allies before the a bombs and there were no deals to surrender to the __name1__ as the __name2__ did not believe they would attack them .
the info they are pointing to is an incomplete picture .
in many ways , what you are saying about both scenarios being impossible to co @-@ exist is exactly what was taking place .
there was the " official " position that the nukes were the only way to force japan to an unconditional surrender then there was the more factual position that japan was trying to surrender .
in both countries there was a power struggle between the military and civilian leadership , but their agendas were in role reversals .
in __name1__ the civilian side was more apt to seeking peace than the military but in the __name2__ it was the military that was pushing for peace more than the civilian leadership under __name3__ .
in regards to your op question about the " necessity " of the bombs , what does it tell you that every top __name1__ leader has agreed that the bombs were not necessary ?
and yet you ignore the fact that until the __value1__ atomic bomb was dropped the __name1__ had no intention of surrendering and even after the __value1__ attack it took direct intervention from the emperor to force the __name2__ to surrender .
once again pea brain the __name1__ never offered to surrender .
the offer to the __name2__ to intercede for them with the __name1__ was not a surrender .
and after the __value1__ bomb they made no credible offer either .
i have the facts to back me up .
the meetings of the __name1__ government .
" this memo showed that the __name1__ were offering surrender terms virtually identical to the ones ultimately accepted by the __name2__ at the formal surrender ceremony on __month1__ __day1__ -- that is , complete surrender of everything but the person of the emperor ."
<a href="http://www.ihr.org/jhr/v16/v16n3p-4_weber.html"> __value1__ @-@ 4_weber.html </a>
have you never realized the __name1__ was designed to inhibit __name2__ 's surrender so the a @-@ bombs could be used ?
no wonder you are such an idiot : poor , poor curvey believes
__name1__ elmer barnes </a> whose career as a professor and then as a journalist was aborted by his contentiousness and his cavalier disregard not only for accuracy but also for truth .
he produced no original scholarly work but synthesized information from his vast reading in a series of prolix and repetitious works on the history of __name1__ civilization .
was it ethical to use the a @-@ bomb on the __name1__ ?
if so , was it ethical to bomb both __name1__ and __name2__ ?
i do not know what is ethical about war .
i have never considered the ethics of war .
i doubt if any soldier even considers this .
his main concern is necessity and self preservation .
as to the dropping of the __value1__ a bomb ...
i wonder if any jap wrote a poem about the excessive sunburn that the population of __name1__ experienced ?
indeed , that which was of the sun did shine on the land of the rising sun ............
but there are warfare ethics , are n't there ?
do n't we have them laid out in the __name1__ ?
do n't we teach them at the __name1__ , etc.?
so the documents relied on by curvelight are suspect , samson ?
i have to admit , i hope that you and retiredgysgt and namvet are right , and quartermass and curvelight are wrong .
this country has enough to feel shame over without a gratitutous a @-@ bombing or __quant1__ to add to that black list .
curvey 's only resource is some nut @-@ case @-@ historical @-@ revisionist .
please check your inbox .
i 'm grateful to you , and so you have a present .
i never referenced __name1__ as a source you lying fuck .
so you 're relying on samson to tell you my sources instead of asking me ?
how much sense does that make ?
__quant1__ source is an article from __month1__ __year1__ :
" in an article that finally appeared __month2__ __day2__ , __year2__ , on the front pages of the __name8__ and the __name9__ @-@ __name9__ , __name1__ revealed that on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ , __quant3__ days prior to his departure for the __name7__ meeting with __name5__ and __name6__ , president __name2__ received a __quant1__ @-@ page memorandum from general __name4__ outlining __quant2__ separate surrender overtures from high @-@ level __name3__ officials .
( the complete text of __name1__ 's article is in the winter __value1__ @-@ 86 journal , pp. 508 @-@ 512.)"
samson claimed my " only resource " is barnes when in fact i 've never referenced barnes at all .
so you just thanked samson for outright lying .
madeline , have you ever responded to the fact our top military leaders all agreed the bombs were not necessary ?
curvelight 's " source " is __name1__ 's __name2__ article .
let 's see what good ol ' __name1__ is all about , shall we ?
__name1__ :
<a href="http://www.adl.org/holocaust/weber.asp"> the professional denier </a>
more than any other propagandist , __name2__ , __quant1__ , embodies the __name1__ @-@ denial movement .
an articulate , media @-@ savvy spokesperson with a master 's degree in history from __name2__ , __name1__ got his start in the radical right in __year1__ , when he took the position of news editor for __name3__ , a publication of the neo @-@ nazi national alliance .
in __year1__ , __name1__ also began to contribute regularly to __name2__ , __quant1__
tabloid produced by __name2__ 's __name1__ organization .
his involvement with the __name1__ also intensified steadily over the years ; initially working as a contributor to the now @-@ defunct ihr newsletter , __name2__ began serving as emcee for the group 's __quant1__ conventions in __year1__ .
in __year1__ he became a member of __name1__ 's editorial advisory committee and in __year2__ he became editor of the __name2__ .
following ihr 's break with __name2__ and the subsequent departure of most professional staff members in __year1__ , __name1__ became director of the organization with __quant1__ professional staff person serving under him .
ahh , yes .
only those as hopelessly stupid as curvey would use __name1__ as a resource .
maybe he has a __name1__ article he 'd like to present with more credability ?
perhaps some alien in the form of elvis has an opinion about ethics and the a @-@ bomb that curvey would like to share ! !
what journal is this curvelight ?
now i am determined to know what the fuck is the deal with these competing documents .
give us the complete citation and i will ask my research librarian to pull it for me .
thankies .
curvelight , i am not the arbiter here .
all usmb @-@ ers get to have the same weight given their opinions .
i 'm just asking questions because i 'm dumbfounded that there is ( apparently ) disagreement as to the historical facts .
well curvelight ?
is this true ?
you 've relied on reporting by a discredited man ?
__name1__ is not my source either you dumbfuck .
that 's the __value1__ time you 've falsely accused a source i 've not used .
but you want to call others stupid ......
lol .
it is an indisputable historical fact that the top __name1__ leaders agreed the bombs were not necessary .
what do you think about that fact ?
i 'm beginning to doubt the sincerity of your op since you have side stepped this at least 4 times .
you have no leg to stand on .
__name1__ never made an attempt to surrender before the atomic bombs .
the only thing they did is offer through the __name1__ to a cease fire and a return to pre war borders .
they would vacate all captured territory that had from after __month1__ __year1__ and we would evacuate all __name1__ territory captured that was owned by them prior to dec 1941 .
that is the only offer made .
poor , poor foolish curvey , linked to __name1__ 's __name2__ article , and does n't even understand who he 's quoting ....
they were wrong .
once again the __name1__ had no intention of surrendering .
even after __quant1__ atomic bombs the army which controlled the government refused to surrender .
" indesputable fact "
like the holocaust , huh ?
your sources also claim that it did not happen .
idiot .
or , they never agreed to any such thing : curvey 's source is bogus : you may as well be arguing with someone that claims it was an " indesputable fact " that martians agreed the a bombs were not necessary , and quotes an article from the __name1__ .
i do n't give a damned if it was ethical or not .
it ended the war and saved millions of __name1__ lives .
bottom line for me .
and i not going with this innocent civilian crap .
they were working in factory 's and making weapons to kill us .
the japs murdered __quant1__ of women and children in occupied countries .
or do we let that slide ? ??
they got what they deserved .
" i fear all we have done is to awaken a sleeping giant and fill him with a terrible resolve ."
fleet admiral __name1__ after the __name2__ attack
yes , women and children died in the __name1__ and elsewhere .
they also died in __name1__ , at the hands and bombs of the allies .
civilians in battlefields do die .
if the __name2__ __name1__ engaged in widespread genocide of the peoples of the __name3__ , i have not heard that .
genocide in @/@ by __name1__ yes , but __name2__ no.
but since when are unarmed civilians , especially children , cannon fodder ?
how many infants died in __name1__ and __name2__ , namvet ?
what weapons did they help manufacture ?
what sort of warfare ethics aims to kill civilians ?
the pov i take is that if we only dropped the a @-@ bomb to show off our shiney new weapon to scare the __name1__ , etc. , it was wrong .
if we did it to force the surrender of __name1__ , it was right .
oh my . well that means your did n't watch the vid on unit 731 .
i put that up for you to prove this .
this is the last i can do to prove it

jap atrocities against civilians are pretty common knowledge .
gez madeline come on .
ever since wars were fought thru the ages .
you did hear about the holocaust ? ???
and their being murdered as i type this .
come on madeline .
everything the military need to fight a war .
then the generals and admirals decided who to use it on .
including civilians .
the japs were building their own nuke .
for who ????
for the last time the bombs were dropped to save __name1__ lives .
this is the last time i respond when you rely on another poster to state my source instead of asking me directly or ignoring the fact i 've pointed to the same article at least three times :

to whatever weight you give usmb @-@ ers , i hope i can add my __quant1__ cents and experience .

i think it 's fair to call myself an expert on the subject and i was mentored by one of the nation 's foremost scholars on the subject..
yes , madeline , i suggest you actually go to the sources of these claims and see what the articles really say , rather than relying on half @-@ quotes .
once again they did not offer pe4 ace .

they offered to just stop the war with no other consequence to them .

a former ambassador to __name2__ , __name1__ ’s knowledge of japanese politics and culture informed his critical stance toward the concept of unconditional surrender .
he believed it essential that the __name1__ declare its intention to preserve the institution of the emperor .
as he argued in this memorandum to president __name1__ , “ failure on our part to clarify our intentions ” on the status of the emperor “ will insure prolongation of the war and cost a large number of human lives.” documents like this have played a role in arguments developed by __name3__ that __name2__ and his advisers had alternatives to using the bomb such as modifying unconditional surrender and that anti @-@ soviet considerations weighed most heavily in their thinking .
by contrast , __name1__ has argued that the __name2__ leadership would “ probably not ” have “ surrendered if the __name3__ administration had clarified the status of the emperor ” when it demanded unconditional surrender .

commenting on another memorandum by __name2__ , george a. lincoln discussed war aims , face @-@ saving proposals for __name1__ , and the nature of the proposed declaration to the japanese government , including the problem of defining “ unconditional surrender.” lincoln argued against modifying the concept of unconditional surrender : if it is “ phrased so as to invite negotiation ” he saw risks of prolonging the war or a “ compromise peace.” __name3__ has observed that those risks help explain why senior officials were unwilling to modify the demand for unconditional surrender .

straight up lie .
the __name1__ never offered a surrender .
they offered an end to hostilities .
you are either lying or a fool .
even after the __value1__ bomb they never offered to surrender .
the __name1__ ran the government and refused to surrender .
even after __quant1__ bombs they refused to surrender .

this review of __name1__ capabilities and intentions portrays an economy and society under “ tremendous strain ”; nevertheless , “ the ground component of the japanese armed forces remains japan ’s greatest military asset.” __name2__ sees statements in this estimate about the impact of __name3__ entry into the war and the possibility of a conditional surrender involving survival of the emperor as an institution as more evidence that the policymakers saw alternatives to nuclear weapons use .
by contrast , __name1__ takes note of the estimate ’s depiction of the __name2__ army ’s terms for peace : “ for surrender to be acceptable to the japanese army it would be necessary for the military leaders to believe that it would not entail discrediting the warrior tradition and that it would permit the ultimate resurgence of a military in japan.” that , __name3__ argues , would have been “ unacceptable to any allied policy maker ”.

another intercept of a cable from __name1__ to __name2__ shows that the foreign minister rejected unconditional surrender and that the emperor was not “ asking the __name3__ ’s mediation in anything like unconditional surrender.” incidentally , this “ magic ’ diplomatic summary ” indicates the broad scope and capabilities of the program ; for example , it includes translations of intercepted __name4__ messages ( see pages 8 @-@ 9 ) .

__name1__ not ready to surrender .
madeline ,
i suggest she do that too .
that 's why i not only provided her with links , but with several scholarly book recommendations that are far more comprehensive , thorough , well @-@ researched and sourced than any website would be .
if she 's genuinely curious about this , it 's a subject i 'm fascinated by and spent a significant portion of my life researching , so i 'm trying to make finding the knowledge for herself as easy as possible .
also , you 'll notice i cited all of my quotes and they can be easily verified .

an intercepted message from __name1__ to __name2__ showed that __name3__ remained interested in securing __name4__ ’s good office but that it “ is difficult to decide on concrete peace conditions here at home all at once.” “[w]e are exerting ourselves to collect the views of all quarters on the matter of concrete terms.” __name5__ , __name6__ , and __name7__ , among others , have argued that the “ magic ” intercepts from the end of __month1__ and early __month2__ show that the __name8__ were far from ready to surrender .
according to __name4__ , for months __name1__ had believed that the “ outlook for a negotiated peace could be improved if __name2__ fought and won __quant2__ last decisive battle , ” thus , hirohito delayed surrender , continuing to “ procrastinate until the bomb was dropped and the __name3__ attacked.”[38 ]
again no plan to surrender .
documents 55a and 55b : early high @-@ level reactions to the __name1__ bombing
document 55a : cabinet meeting and __name1__ 's meeting with the emperor , __month1__ __day1__ @-@ __month1__ , __year1__ · source : __name2__ ( ministry of foreign affairs ) ed.
shusen shiroku ( the historical records of the end of the war ) , annotated by __name1__ , volume 4 , 57 @-@ 60 [ excerpts ] [ translation by toshihiro higuchi ]
document 55b : diary entry for wednesday , __month1__ , __year1__ · source : takashi itoh , ed . , sokichi takagi : nikki to joho [ sokichi takagi : diary and documents ] ( __name3__ , __name4__ : misuzu @-@ shobo , __year2__ ) , 923 @-@ 924 [ translation by hikaru tajima ] · ground zero at __name1__ today : this was the site of __name2__ hospital ; the atomic explosion occurred __quant1__ feet above it ( photo courtesy of lynn eden , <a __value1__ www.wholeworldonfire.com </a> )
excerpts from the foreign ministry 's compilation about the end of the war show how news of the bombing reached __name1__ as well as how foreign minister 's __name2__ initially reacted to reports about __name3__ .
when he learned of the atomic bombing from the __name4__ , __name1__ believed that it was time to give up and advised the cabinet that the atomic attack provided the occasion for __name2__ to surrender on the basis of the __name3__ .
__name1__ could not persuade the cabinet , however , and the army wanted to delay any decisions until it had learned what had happened to __name2__ .
when the foreign minister met with the emperor , __name1__ agreed with him ; he declared that the top priority was an early end to the war , although it would be acceptable to seek better surrender terms--probably __name2__ acceptance of a figure @-@ head emperor--if it did not interfere with that goal .
in light of those instructions , __name1__ and prime minister __name3__ agreed that the __name2__ should meet the next day .
[ 42 a ]
an entry from admiral __name1__ 's diary for __month1__ conveys more information on the mood in elite __name2__ circles after __name3__ , but before the __name4__ declaration of war and the bombing of __name5__ .
seeing the bombing of __name2__ as a sign of a worsening situation at home , __name1__ worried about further deterioration .
nevertheless , his diary suggests that military hard @-@ liners were very much in charge and that prime minister __name1__ was talking tough against surrender , by evoking last ditch moments in __name2__ history and warning of the danger that subordinate commanders might not obey surrender orders .
the last remark aggravated navy minister __name1__ who saw it as irresponsible .
that the __name1__ had made no responses to __name2__ 's request for a meeting was understood as a bad sign ; __name3__ realized that the government had to prepare for the possibility that __name4__ might not help .
one of the visitors mentioned at the beginning of the entry was __name1__ who became minister of the interior in the next cabinet .
again hardliners controlled the government and had no intention of surrender even after the __value1__ atomic bomb .
the emperor wanted better terms before he would agree .
do you think you 're somehow disproving , or even arguing , with what i said ?
they were never willing to surrender unconditionally , i made that quite clear .
they were however willing to surrender with the sole condition that the emperor retain his throne , we refused that sole condition , dropped __quant1__ atomic bombs on their cities , and then allowed the emperor to retain his throne anyway .
that is a lie , they demanded __quant1__ conditions .
after the __value1__ bomb and the __name1__ attack the emperor changed it to __quant1__ condition .
prior to the atomic bombs they only offered a cease fire and return to __month1__ __year1__ borders .
i was fully prepared for you to try and jump on that and had __name1__ 's quote from his book ready to use in response .
what you fail to understand is his prediction that it would not go off has absolutely nothing to do with the fact he said the bombs were not necessary .
quentin already posted __name1__ 's quote so i do n't need to .
so will you respond to the fact our top military leaders all agreed the bombs were not necessary or will you continue to be dishonest and claim i 'm citing sources i 've not cited ?
wait ....
are n't you the same person that had no idea of the significance the bombs had with __name1__ ?
do you know what else happened on __month1__ __day1__ th , __year1__ ?
from everything i 've read , and talking with people at my grandpop 's lodge , this is the version i believe .
i think the __name1__ administration did the right thing to save __name2__ lives as terrifying as it was .
madeline ,
i purposefully cited half of __name1__ 's quote because his prediction the bombs would not detonate have no bearing on his position they were not necessary .
there was no risk of a failed detonation whether the bombs worked or not .
if they did n't go off they would have simply looked like conventional duds .
it 's not like the __name1__ military would have said " look !
the nukes did n't go off ! "
although any poor sucker who would have opened a dud would not exactly be radiating with joy .......
i cannot get any pro @-@ bomb person to answer a couple of questions so maybe you can .
if we dropped the bombs to force an unconditional surrender , then why is it the __name1__ changed its surrender terms instead of __name2__ ?
do you realize that after the bombs were dropped it was not __name1__ who changed their conditions for surrender but the __name2__ ?
if it was worth nuking __quant1__ civilian populations to try and force an unconditional surrender then why did we give up ?
the nukes did n't change __name1__ 's terms for surrender so why did n't we invade ?
why did n't we continue firebombing , blockades and air raids ?
the emperor only agreed to the provision of a a surrender with him in control after the __value1__ bomb , not before .
there is no surrender agreement prior to the __value1__ atomic blast .
all they offered was to cease hostilities and return to the __month1__ __year1__ lines .
even after the __value1__ blast the emperor did not force the __name1__ to give up .
he told them to continue to work for better terms .
they offered __quant1__ terms which were rejected .
after the __value1__ bomb and a __name2__ invasion the __name1__ still refused to surrender .
it took the emperor to intervene and even then the __name1__ tried a coup to stop him
show us in the __name1__ where the emperor 's disposition is stated upon agreement of surrender .
they wanted to surrender on their terms .
what was our offical policy ? ???
i have no idea .
invasion would have cost __name1__ lives .
if it came down , as i understand it did , to __name1__ servicepeople dying or __name2__ , it is a no brainer .
remember __name1__ .
you 're full of shit as i just posted the fact __name1__ offered the terms for surrender and we accepted .
also ......
__name1__ , __name2__ , and __name3__ all stated the bombs were not necessary for a surrender .
could you explain why we should believe you over them ?
your facts and your documentation are wrong .
check it out for your own creditability 's sake , curve .
what facts are wrong ?
if you know then you should have stated what they were and proven them wrong .
you ignored the earlier posting , so i moved it to here .
because you have not bothered to read the declassified material from the __year1__ strategic planning ops for the __name1__ invasion that have been released in the last decade .
it turns out that __name1__ , __name2__ , and __name3__ were all wrong , and that __name4__ made the right decisiohttp://www.historyofwar.org/articles/wars_downfall3.htmln · .
now did you really suggest that __name1__ offered to surrender in __month1__ __year1__ ?
really ?
oh , my .
your argument is a false analogy .
choose something more equivalent .
a land invasion may well not have succeeded .
the casualties were going to be incredible even if the allied armies managed to consolidate beach heads , much less push inland .
the bombs were necessary .
there is no real argument about this anymore .
it 's one of those flat historical facts that is indisputable .
that must be why you work so hard to avoid simple questions .
quentin posted a boat load of facts you people won't even pretend to address .
if new facts invalidate the old facts , the discussion is over .
starkey : mutter bugret sherlock mutter onna bun mutter mutter gu gu ca ca ( the discussion is over )
he posted no facts .
he cl ; aimed as you have that __name1__ offered to surrender before the atomic bombs , that is a bald faced lie .
all __name1__ offered was to cease the war and return to the __year1__ start lines .
and after __quant1__ bomb they still demanded their terms be meet .
it took __quant1__ bombs , a __name1__ invasion and the direct intervention of the emperor to end the war .
even then the __name1__ attempted a coup .
he posted no facts ?
holy fuck .
dishonest people like you should have to pay other posters .
you completely ignored the question in 196 .
you claimed my facts are wrong but have n't done a fuxxing thing to support that claim .
damn namvet .....
are you ever honest on this issue ?
i posted the vids and docs .
not good enough ? ???

you babbling imbecile .
if your capable , and i doubt it , read the entire post shit for brains
more proof this has to be __quant1__ of the worst fucking boards on the net .
when cunts like you know you are wrong you do nothing but whine and ignore the info .
curve , you would make an ideal representive for this countries enemies .
it was understood at the time that unless the japanese surrendered , we would lose as many as a half a million to a million of our fighting men to finally defeat the __name1__ empire .
and the __name1__ were not going to surrender .
the citizenry was being trained in how to fight to the last man , woman and child .
it took the atomic bomb to prove to them that it was futile .
and even the __value1__ did n't turn the trick .
compared to how many of our soldiers ' lives were at stake -- not even counting the many fold more __name1__ lives that would be lost -- the math alone underscores a tragic ( but real ) morality in going atomic .
a horrible , horrifying and wrenching decision by president __name1__ ?
absolutely .
but immoral ?
based on the quantification of human life , the decision was far more moral than the alternative .
this is the same exact line that 's been proven wrong on several levels .
the bombs did not make __name1__ change its conditions for surrender .
at .
all .
the conditions of surrender were not __name1__ 's .
they were ours .
the atomic bombs sure as hell did make __name1__ acquiesce to them .
your bogus and unsupported claim that this " line " has been " proven [ sic ] wrong on several levels " is bullshit .
of course , bullshit is your sole stock in trade , so it 's no surprise you 'd say such dishonest shit .

i 've never claimed __name1__ offered an " unconditional surrender " you lying fuck .

you 're a fucking dumbass no matter what issue you try to debate and you prove it once again .
the official __name1__ policy before the bombs was an " unconditional surrender ."
after the bombs it was the __name1__ that gave in to __name2__ 's terms you ignorant fuck .
" on __month1__ __day1__ , the __name1__ announced that it would accept the __name2__ surrender , making clear in its statement that the emperor could remain in a purely ceremonial capacity only ."
embarrass yourself some more snitch bitch .
[ quote=samson ; 2319282 ]
you keep ignoring the fact __name1__ clearly stated the bombs were not necessary for __name2__ to surrender .
why ?
because you are n't here to discuss anything .
you 're a parasite .
your puerile and always ineffective effort at ad hominem has never bolstered even __quant1__ of your ridiculous arguments and in this case it constitutes just another massive fail by you in your long line of massive fails .
we called for unconditional surrender and we got it the day after we dropped the __value1__ of the __quant1__ atomic bombs .
that we chose to be even moderately magnanimous does n't change the equation at all .
not even a tiny little bit .
the __name1__ were permitted to keep their titular head , the emperor .
we granted them that much .
but the unconditional surrender we had demanded came only when they saw clearly that we could completely destroy them .
( ironically , the __value2__ atomic bomb was the __value1__ in our then very tiny " stockpile ."
but thankfully , the enemy was in no position to realize this .)
i have not embarrassed me , you stupid pussypuddle .
i embarrassed you , even if you remain too stupid and dishonest to recognize it or admit it .
of course , as always , you embarrassed yourself , too .
you always do .
snitch bitch .
i just posted the fact __name1__ offered a conditional surrender and we accepted their conditional surrender which means it was not an unconditional surrender .
keep embarrassing yourself snitch bitch .

you keep editing the full quote :

your argument is a fail , at all levels , curvelight .
so , am i to take it that we 've abandoned the ethics discussion on this thread for rehashing history ?
just fyi , this particular bit of history was already re @-@ hashed on another usmb thread about __quant1__ months ago .
maybe y'all wanna search for it and pick that argument up where it died off .
pussypuddle :
you are not permitted to re @-@ write history , pussy drippings .
we demanded and got an unconditional surrender .
we elected ( for reasons of our own ) to allow __name1__ to keep it 's titular head .
that 's the fact , jackass .
it does n't convert the unconditional surrender into anything else .
sorry .
end of story .
all your pathetic attempts to contort it or twist it and lie your absurd ass off about it will never change it .
i realize you are far too much of a gutless pussy to ever admit that you are wrong ( well , in fairness , you did have to concede one time that you were wrong ) but that does n't change rality here : you remain wrong , menstrualmess .
now , of course , you being the abjectly and always dishonest lying cowardly pussy that you are will deny the plain words of the text , but the __name1__ signed by __name2__ ending wwii is really quite clear :
we , acting by command of and on behalf of the emperor of japan , the japanese government and the japanese __name1__ , hereby accept the provisions in the declaration issued by the heads of the governments of the __name2__ , __name3__ , and __name4__ __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ at potsdam , and subsequently to by the __name5__ , which four powers are hereafter referred to as the __name6__ .
we hereby proclaim the unconditional surrender to the __name3__ of the __name2__ __name1__ and of all japanese armed forces and all armed forces under japanese control wherever situated .
__name2__ __name1__ of __name3__ - wikipedia , the free encyclopedia </a>
it was difficult for the __name1__ to grant unconditional surrender to the __name2__ .
it appears to be even harder for you to admit an historical fact .
i 've already posted the fact __name1__ offered a conditional surrender we accepted snitch bitch .
when i said " keep embarrassing yourself " i did n't mean for you to make it your only mission in life .

i have , however , completely exposed and humiliated you ; but you are such a lying pussypuddle that you are not even aware of how humiliated you should feel at this point .
__name1__ did not " offer " the surrender , either , you retarded asshole @-@ licker .
we offered it and they were obliged to accept it .
you cannot get anything straight .
poor demented curvey .

i will continue to ignore your bullshit dishonest spin as long as you continue to ignore the historical reality .
__name1__ signed the un conditional surrender , pussypuddle .
need to read it again ?
end of story .
straight up lie .
before the bombs __name1__ wanted us to agree to a cease fire and a return to our __year1__ start lines .
they wanted no foreign presence in __name1__ , no change of government and no change of the military .
after the __value1__ bomb they still tried to make demands they want __quant1__ things only __value1__ of which was the emperor .
after __quant1__ bombs and a __name1__ declaration of war they agreed to surrender and we agreed to let them keep their emperor as a figure head only .
the final surrender was unconditional .
as evidenced by the documents the __name1__ signed .
you have yet to provide us with all the supposed surrender attempts by __name1__ in __year1__ .
you keep making the claim but provide absolutely no evidence of such .
there is nothing that can be posted that you would pay attention to unless it appeared to re @-@ affirm your pre @-@ maturely developed position .
i 've already posted evidence that you flat out ignore but demand more ......
targeting civilians or civilian population centers is always unethical ; using weapons of mass destruction makes the situation unimaginably worse from a moral standpoint .
by __year1__ , __name1__ 's military had been crippled to the point of ineffectiveness .
a bombing campaign against strategic military and industrial targets could have been carried out with minimal casualties among the __name1__ as well as among __name2__ 's civilian population .
one of the reasons the sites were chosen was based on creating an atomic barometer .
they needed to drop the bombs in places that were very much in tact to measure the damage and fall out .
that is exactly what happened : __quant1__ atomic bombs and the __name1__ invasion ended the war with very little casualties to __name2__ .
no atomic bombs , no surrender .
you are now engaged in the immorality of stubbornness .
your assertion has flatly been disproved .
you can n't admit it , which says very poorly about your character .
you have made a claim , that __name1__ offered to surrender in __year1__ numerous times before either bomb was dropped .
prove it .
the only offer they ever made was through the __name1__ and that was not a surrender it was a cease fire with a pullback to the __year1__ line for all sides .
and according to this offer nothing else would be done to the __name1__ .
after the __value1__ bomb was dropped they made an offer with __quant1__ demands .
we rejected it .
after the __value1__ bomb and the __name2__ declaration of war and invasion __name1__ 's emperor ordered an immediate surrender with no conditions .
the __name1__ accepted and changed the term to keeping the emperor as a figure head .
__name1__ surrendered unconditionally .
this is rock solid proof you ignore facts you do n't like because i 've linked a government website showing __name1__ offered a conditional surrender but you continue to ignore it .....
like your twin starkey .
flatly disproved ?
lol ....
you have ignored the government link __quant1__ posted showing __name1__ 's offer of a surrender on __quant1__ condition and we accepted .
but you keep on ignoring that ..........
hell .....
you do n't even attempt to support your claims like saying all the top military leaders were wrong for saying the bomb was not necessary .
your website misinterprets the facts , thus the conclusion is wrong .
you would fail any paper you had to turn in on this subject with that interpretation .
the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that you are intellectually anoxeric , refusing to ingest all the evidence .
this is not being persuasive , but demagogic on your part .
curve , the rest of __name1__ is not out of step , you are .
he cannot admit it , which only makes him pitiful .
you are a liar .
i provided the minutes from the __name1__ government , i provided the __name2__ intercepts , they made a surrender offer only after the __value1__ bomb .
you have claimed they made numerous requests including just keeping the emperor .
prove your claim .
true .
but like a bad dog which has shit on your rug , he can have his nose rubbed in it :
bad pussypuddle .
bad bitch .
vj __name1__ __name2__ .
i do n't think dead japs were on their minds
__quant1__ years ago my dad shot this film along kalakaua ave . in __name1__ capturing spontaneous celebrations that broke out upon __value1__ hearing news of the __name2__ surrender .
__name3__ __quant1__ mm film : __name2__ bless __name3__ , right ?
i was able to find an outfit to do a much superior scan of this footage to what i had previously posted , so i re @-@ did this film and replaced the older version there are still images from this amazing day , in color , at __value1__
just remember that it takes a village so that conloons like curve do n't ran amuck across the countryside being chased by people with pitchforks and torches .
what yo @-@ yos they are .
lol ...
same stoopid shit .
you say a post is wrong then throw in ad homs and do n't even attempt to support your claims .
that is exactly what happened :
no , it is n't , unless you believe that the instant vaporization of hundreds of thousands of people can be written off because of their nationality .
what a disingenuous claim .
i suppose this type of callousness towards the slaughter of civilians should be expected from an avowed zionist .
__quant1__ atomic bombs and the __name1__ invasion ended the war with very little casualties to __name2__ .
baseless .
nationality is an artificial distinction .
the location of a person 's birth does n't make his life any more or less valuable than his neighbor 's .
hundreds of thousands were not vaporized in either city dumb ass .
and yes the __quant1__ bombs ended the __name1__ war , with out them we would have been forced to invade them .
curvelight would never have been born .
hmmm
what a goof .
the nation states have superseded the papacy and the caliphate , and geography grounds an individual 's character and values system .
the proper course was taken about __name1__ and __name2__ .
where is the evidence how many were saved by leaflets ?
you 're also glossing over the fact we targeted and killed countless civilians out of pure evil .
how sad , the __name1__ died , i did not read all the posts in this thread so maybe the next fact has been covered , if so forgive me .
how about the hundreds of thousands of lives the __name1__ saved in __name2__ by dropping leaflets warning the japanese that we were going to drop a bomb on nagasaki , hundreds of thousands fled and lived
war is not ethical or moral .
i dont think killing is ethical or moral for any reason ever .
we had to fight the war period , it was not our choice , the war forced us to do unethical , immoral acts .
is it justifiable to act unethically , yes .
is it justifiable to be immoral , yes .
we did not start the __name1__ , we were forced to defend ourselves , unfortunately the lesser of __quant1__ evils is to kill the enemy before the enemy kills your children .
do you watch a man rape and kill a child or do you do the unethical immoral act of killing the man , justice demands man break the moral codes of society .
did they win the debate ????
doink
there was no debate you dumbfuck .
then why the opinions moron ????
your the knight in shinning armour condeming the world for its actions .
you were there ? ???
tell us all about it .
since your all right and we 're all wrong .
you are a lying sack of puss filled vomit .
but then you prove that every day here do n't you ?
strange these american barbarians , as curve refers to them , spent billions raising the japs and __name1__ 's from the post war rubble and rebuilding their countries .
and turning __name1__ into one of the biggest economic giants in histroy .
can you explain this strange behavior ?????
why did the top __quant1__ military commanders say the bombs were n't necessary ?
are you joking ?
stop dodging you raggedy cunt and explain why you claim to know better than those __quant1__ commanders .
once again you fall flat on your ass .
you stated all military leaders opposed it .
now your down to 3 . you can n't even find your ass with both hands .
get your story straight shit for brains .
why ? ??
your dead brain is surrounded by a brick wall
none of whom fought the __name1__ .
please .
it 's like you get paid a lot of money to embarrass yourself .
you claim to know better than them , do n't even attempt to explain why , then ignore their views because they did n't fight the __name1__ ?
holy fuck you are stoopid .
no the stupid one is you .
none of the generals or admirals that fought the __name1__ are on your list , now are they ?
the __name2__ war against the __name1__ was so different from the __name3__ war as to make the experiences learned from one pointless in the other .
the reality is a simple one .
the __name1__ intended to force an unconditional surrender .
the __name1__ on paper were beaten but refused to give up and had millions of troops under arms with millions more civilians able to be called on .
the __name1__ government was fanatical .
run by the army they had no intention of surrendering .
we were looking at a main island landing the __value1__ part of __year1__ .
this would have cost millions of lives mostly __name1__ .
none of the __name1__ officers had a clue what the __name2__ were like .
holy fuck you keep increasing your stoopidity factor .
__name1__ was the supreme commander in the __name2__ from __year1__ @-@ __year2__ you dumb bitch .
why do n't you tell us all how the supreme commander of the __name1__ did n't " have a clue " about the __name2__ .
not to mention ...
if not fighting the japs eliminates the possibility of an opinion ....
then why do you claim to have one you fuxxing cunt ?
yep , there is curve 's rational , bright brain .
you moron .
everyone is laughing at you .
curvelight , you are clearly emotionally disturbed and cognitively impaired .
the rest of the world is overwhelming in step , and you are out of step .
you are wrong , period .
good job on sticking to ad homs when you can n't support your claims .
you never showed why all the commanders were wrong and your __name1__ melthod is fuxxing stale .
the __name1__ method is your idiocy , and the event proved the few commanders who opposed it to be wrong .
this discussion proves that your cognition is definitely impaired .
so move along , your case is summarily dismissed .
eots is waiting for you in the conspiracy forums .
once again you fucking donkey dick sucker ......
you said :
" curvelight has made the claim we never intended to invade __name1__ ."
so show where i made that claim you lying fuck .
so curvelight .....
since the __name2__ was prepared to invade the __name3__ , the __name1__ were unwilling to surrender and were training their civilians to human wave attack the landing beaches with bamboo spears , and you never claimed the casualty figures were false .....
you would rather have seen several million dead __name1__ and upwards of a million casualties on the allied side , rather then drop __quant1__ bombs that killed far less people ?
and you want us to believe that dropping the bombs was unethical ?
you are a coward .
an intellectual coward and an ethical coward .
you keep making ignorant claims that are not true and i can link to them through out this thread .
you claimed __name1__ made numerous attempts to surrender before the bombs were dropped .
an out right lie you can not support .
they made __quant1__ attempt and it was not a surrender but a cessation of hostilities with __name1__ relinquishing captured territory after __month1__ __year1__ and the allies returning captured japanese territory .
you claimed that __name1__ made the exact same offer to surrender before the bombs were dropped as the one we finally accepted , which was unconditional .
another bald faced lie .
you claimed __name1__ did not surrender unconditionally , when we all know and have the surrender documents to prove they did exactly that .
you claimed that the __name1__ fabricated casualty estimates for an invasion of __name2__ .
implying further that we had no intention of invading and that __name1__ was already beaten .
another lie .
and i disagree .
the question is a simple one .
do we kill a few hundred thousand in order to save millions or do we just kill millions .
that is an ethics question .
you may not like the ethics but it is ethical .
your saying it does not make it so .
your question implies you have the right to decide who lives and who dies , you do n't .
the only life you have a right to make that choice about is your own .
absolutely incorrect .
decisions of the most horrific choices are caused by tyrannical governments and leaders that force men and women of good will to make such choices .
please , naivete informs your statement .
please think very carefully before uttering such statements .
you 're full of shit and i 've proven several times the bombs were not necessary but you keep on wrapping your ignorance up in a form of patriotism indistinguishable from butt monkey crack .
no , it was not unethical .
you have not proven anything .
once again , you claimed the __name1__ made numerous attempts to surrender before the bombs were dropped .
a lie .
you claimed that __name1__ made an offer exactly like what was given them after the bombs .
you claimed that __name1__ was offered a conditional surrender .
again a lie .
meanwhile , i provided proof __name1__ made __quant1__ attempt to end the war before the bombs were dropped and that was no surrender offer .
i provided proof that even after both bombs were dropped and the __name2__ declared war the __name1__ government refused to surrender .
it took the direct intervention of the emperor and that was nearly foiled by an attempted coup by the army .
try again you coward .
so you can not provide any factual evidence to support your bogus claims ?
we already knew this , keep on lying it is hilarious .
" i think it was a good thing that __name1__ dropped the atomic bomb on __name2__ .
that is all i have to say about my parents " · -@ watchmen
maybe you 're onto something .
i was thinking the __name1__ should absorb the __name2__ , but then we do n't need you so it would be only an act of charity .
we could pawn you off on the __name1__ but they do n't need you either .
matter of fact seems everybody can do their own flying and fighting on the ground but you powderpuffs .
probably be best if we divvy up your assets among the __quant1__ useful services and just send y'all home since you could n't pass a pft and the sight of an actual bayonet would make you faint .
or perhaps y'all should be re @-@ absorbed back into the army where you came from .
you know ...
back when the __name1__ was worth a fuck ?
that 's cold , gunny .
my service was not in vain .
i maintained nuclear missiles , something that keeps the cockroaches from fucking with us .
plus , i can fold hospital corners like a fucking pro .
me , too .
i hand wash and fold laundry like a demon on steroids , too .
hell the nav even showed me how to hang up my wash on a clothes line with little pieces of rope .
now there 's some skills i can take to the bank , eh ?
i 'm like totally qualified to run a pre @-@ industrial laundry service .
and remember , the motto of the editecian laundry service , you pampered hopelessly non @-@ domestic letherheads , dogs and flyboys ...
no tickee ?
no forking washee , and that 's no shit .
ha , that washing woman is the daughter of a bar girl from __name1__ who migrated to kinville .
the washing woman 's daughter now runs a mojo house .
i love you no shit , now buy your own fucking drink .
all the men in my family have always been __name1__ .
and all of them are some hard motherf'ers .
i 've never known an army guy that even came close .
for my tax dollars i think we should expand the __name1__ and take the funding necessary from the army .
no need for a long term mission if everyone is dead .
i have a brother in __name1__ right now .
at night when i say my prayers i make sure to include the __name1__ because i know what he 's capable of .
do n't get all sensitive on me now .
you know who the remark was directed to and why . i grew up in the __name1__ .
my father is a retired chief , and my grandfather ( his father ) a retired __name1__ sgtmaj .
i have nothing but respect for the other services .
but when it 's time to play the interservice rivalry shit @-@ talking game , and it 's aimed my way , i 'm returning fire .
ooh @-@ rah !
cool logic , just because you never met any so called " hard motherf'ers " in the __name1__ it does not mean they fail to exsist .
but of course coming from a family of __name1__ i will exscuse your bias opinion .
well , we could discuss the army 's judgement .
both of my brothers are army zeroes .
that 's almost like being in the real army , is n't it ?
one has to wonder just what the hell the army was thinking with that dynamic duo ; especially , the __name1__ grad .
do i suspect a bit of sibling jealousy ?
well i do suspect that the siblings are a bit jealous of the gunny being , well , a gunny .
yeah , like being a sailor is almost like being a __name1__ !
all you swabbies look the same to me !
sorry , could n't resist .
on a side note , for those of you who think there are no hardcore army folks , you need to quit hanging out with the remfs !
why did __name1__ wait so long in getting our people out of __name2__ ?
i thought the other day when they were saying " no problem " they were actually evacuating as they spoke .
they had to be .
now __quant1__ hear as things are boiling over they are just thinking about taking a ship over there going through the __name1__ fror __quant1__ month long trip ?
did anyone tell __name1__ it 's dangerous over there ?
tens of thousands of __name1__ !
i have family waiting in the __name1__ right now .
they report that there are no planes coming in or out , and that there are tens of thousands of people at the airport .
the __name1__ reports that we are evacuating - so i called them to see where they got the information - and they said the embassy - as you can imagine - getting through to the __name3__ embassy in __name2__ is impossible at this time .
my family has been told by __name1__ ( today ) that there is no evacuation order in place , and that there is nothing we can do but wait .
so i really do n't think this is even happening .
__name2__ did quite a bit of coverage this morning with __name1__ .
she does excellent work in the middel __name1__ .
she flew in yesterday , but said no flights out .
the airport seems safe .
the rioters are pretty focused on the police and the president .
some reports coming out for __name1__ not to go to the airport but to find their own way via car to other cities or countries if they have the resources .
feeling very bad for them..
the __name2__ dealer was no more a perpetrator than the __name1__ imam .
the __name1__ dealer would not think to open up a store on the site of a mass murder .
nobody would defend the decency of his decision to do that , including me .
the __name1__ imam , he does n't have the same decency and respect .
cool .
using that logic , if some __name1__ goes postal in some small town in __name2__ , we 'll demolish the church ....
impossible .
__name1__ has never been responsible for any atrocities throughout the history of mankind .
/sarcasm
i 'm betting if __name1__ were responsible for atrocities you 'd love them more .
sic .
than why the outrage over the mosque at ground zero ?
im not outraged over it .
revere
that aside your analogy is flawed .
if __quant1__ people were killed by a gun , then you have a point .
to make your analogy similar you would have to have somebody open a place that sells aeroplanes .
iow , a mosque had nothing to do with it ....
actually , mosques were used to plot attacks , here and all over the world .
that 's not in dispute .
that sounds like a crime !
you know , the kind of thing where , if you could prove it , you could actually get people locked up for !
revere
it is in reality .
visit us here occsassionally ....
we miss you .
__name1__ was .
revere
[ img ]
[/img ]
they killed another __name1__ in __name2__ today .
how many think it would be cool for us to fly airplanes into the pyraminds and erect a big __name1__ church on the site ?
raise your hand !
so now you 're comparing one of the __quant1__ wonders of the world with the twin towers ?
more worryingly , you are comparing a __value1__ rd world shithole 's morals/mores/norms with that of the __name1__ .
how does that feel ?
the site of the wtc is hallowed ground , just like where the __name1__ sunk .
there are remains of __name1__ brutally killed in both of those places .
it deserves the same reverence , decency , and respect .
so just how far is the standoff from __name1__ to the point where you want to afford __name2__ their constitutional rights ?
there are hundreds of mosques in __name1__ , and several offers of alternate sites .
it 's not an issue of __name1__ rights , it 's an issue of the lack of decency and respect shown by __name2__ imams .
it 's absolutely an issue of constitutional rights .
revere
he 's not far from wrong .
but he won't be able to tell you why ...
if you claimed to be respectful and decent , why would you thumb your nose at familes of survivors who asked to to build your mosque elsewhere ?
i felt similar to you at the outset .
then i realised that you are punishing people through no fault of their own .
so , those good " __name1__ " folk in __name2__ who killed those __quant1__ civil rights ' boys back in the __decade1__ s should have their local church demolished ?
where did __name1__ discuss the __name2__ bombing with __name3__ ?
the local __name1__ ?
and if so , is that to be demolished , too ?
who are the __name2__ clerics stepping forward to claim they ordered these atrocities , as __name1__ imams always do ?
who are the __name1__ imans doing the same ?
no it 's not .
it 's mainly commercial real estate .
and you can n't walk on any ground in __name1__ city..
someone has n't croaked on .
i bet if we blew up some big __name1__ statues they 'd love us .
i bet if i said __name1__ represented all __name2__ you 'd blow a foo @-@ foo valve ...
you know , when bodies get mixed up at __name1__ , the military haters are out in force with all of their " respect for the dead " lip service .
when you ask them for a little decency and respect in a place where human tissue was flying out of destroyed aircraft on the buildings below as far as far as jet parts , they can n't deal with that .
you ready to call for the __name1__ to quit the __name2__ ?
so , how much stand off does __name1__ get ?
and do we limit any new buildings ( short of a monument ) or just the religions that offend us personally .
does n't affect the fact that i 'm not
i am not sure i understand the context overall ....
but i 'll give it a whirl .
i saw that as a twitter btw , in any event if __quant1__ guys like this guy went out and committed the same crimes , then there is most probably a common causality , here this is n't the case , he appears unbalanced and ....
the end of him is the end of this singular event via his madness that drove him to it .
i think the mosque and what we see as motivating factor behind khobar towers , the embassies , the cole , 911 , hasan are linked , it does n't disappear with just __quant1__ terrorists .
if a legitimate group of survivors families asks for respect , then a religion of peace should honor that .
if they do n't , then they 're offensive assholes .
they are not asking to clear out all of lower __name1__ of mosques .
i weep at this non @-@ story
agreed .
what is legitimate ?
what about the families who said they did n't mind or even supported the mosque ?
some of those survivors were of the __name1__ faith .
the context is to simply point out that __name1__ says __quant1__ thing , but does another .
for the larger issue , if you are going to take that route , then is __name1__ an inherently evil @/@ violent religion ?
what thing has she done and what other thing has she done ?
as far as evil ?
no of course not , but its best we be on our guard , theres only one or 2 threads that ties the overarching threat together ...
*shrugs* what are we supposed to do forget the minute after a t act is committed or self bungled or unsuccessful for whatever reason ?
the mosque issue itself ?
i wish they would employ understanding and display sensitivity myself ...
my opinion of it might change if they showed respect to the survivors and families who perished at the wtc .
barring that , they 're nothing but self @-@ centered ideologues .
so what ?
that does n't negate the majority of survivors who do n't want it there .
the quote in the title is hers .
opposing the mosque is the thing that she has done .
if " crimes begin and end with the criminal who committed them ", then why hold an entire religion accountable for the actions of __quant1__ people .
link to poll of survivors .
thanks ....
what is " show respect "?
apparently , reopening a __name1__ .
because that is what this house of worship and community center will replace .
seriously , does n't this hurt ?
it 's a great argument .
if you do n't agree , refute it .
the cheap shot does n't cut it maddie .
okay , let me see if i can explain , missourian .
for the days since the terrible shooting in __name1__ , revere and __quant1__ have been arguing .
i have said the violent rhetoric should be foreclosed , and he has said i am undercutting free speech .
he does not at all agree that an atmosphere of such speech may make such tragedies likely to recur .
" only the shooter is responsible ", he keeps saying .
but in the case of the park 51 __name1__ , he seems to do a complete backflip .
now all __name2__ __name1__ , all mosques , are somehow responsible for __name3__ @/@ __name3__ .
now , a tenuous connection ( that only exists if you agree with his beliefs about the role of religion in that tragedy , and i do not ) between those who commit a crime and those whose speech may support their ideas ( and other premise i 'm not buying ) should be used to foreclose freedom of religion .
consistency is not exactly revere 's hallmark here .
he still makes a good point ...
one i 've made myself .
i have as yet to meet a __name1__ i did n't like .
and even tho __name1__ man and i often disagree , i like him personally .
but i still oppose the gz mosque for the exact reason revere put forward .
just like i would oppose a __name1__ shrine built at __name2__ during __name3__ or a __name4__ outlet opening next to the __name5__ in tuscon next month .
when __name1__ extremist are no longer plotting to kill us , we can revisit the subject .
i 'm having trouble with you analogy .
no one is saying an existing mosque should be demolished .
the debate is whether or not a new mosque should be built at that very location .
so , i am having trouble understanding how you come up with demolishing the church in __name1__ .
immie
i think in his twisted mind denying the killers the privilege of building a mosque to establish __name1__ dominance over __name2__ culture at ground zero is the same as demolishing a mosque that already exists .
i guess .
it 's sick and twisted , but i think that 's it .
grump is a sad , hateful little bigot .
i 'd like to say he grows on you with time , but except in the sense that a fungus or viral infection grows , it just is n't true .
yep __name1__ through their history have a propensity of building mosques on conquered lands ...
hence the project 's __value1__ name of ' cordoba '...
and the scumbags certainly built a mosque in __name1__ , __name2__ after their conquest .
you cannot apply vicarious liability to one group and not to another , missourian .
that is why i have said revere puts himself into a pretzel shape .
in what ?
__year1__ a.d.?
i guess you are n't aware of the history of christianity in the __name1__ , or in __name2__ ?
idiot ...
you are unaware totally are n't you ?
nice try at obfuscation .
the object of __name1__ is clear .
you reamain ignorant .
poor little maddie ...
thinks because it 's the __century1__ st century their conquest is gone ...
*moron*
what group did __name1__ belong to ?
would n't you expect them to build mosques in their own territories ?
they controlled __name1__ for quite awhile back then .
i 'm sure there were plenty of __name1__ churches built during and shortly after the various __name2__ in what had formally been __name3__ territories .
the __name1__ community center in nyc that has been termed the ground zero mosque is not a monument of __name1__ victory but rather a place of worship that __name2__ muslims would like to build and according to our own constitution they have the right to build it if they own the property .
i still feel that it would be disrespectful to build on ground zero .
he was an __name1__ , and evidentially had some interest in politics .
one would expect that ?
they had a victory on __name1__ soil .
why do you think the fervant push to build so close to where they murdered so many ?
it 's a statement by them ...
as they have done throughout their history .
none .
he was a nutcase in his own right .
bullshit .
to say a lone gunman with no particular political views and no backing is the same as the thousands of zealots , fueled by $$ and rhetoric of their imams are the same is juvenile and dangerous .
stop defending terrorism , madeline .
it 's not a good thing .
even if you do it by pretending it does n't exist .
it does exist , and it 's a fucking crime .
__name1__ is a controlled and carefully orchestrated terrorist movement .
__name1__ lunatic acting on his own is not .
there are no groups of right wingers dancing in the streets waving signs that say " death to liberals ! "
or people stepping forward to support this guy 's family .
if he dies tomorrow , he won't be considered a martyr ; there will be no mother saying " i 'm proud of what my son did ! "
i can n't believe you cannot fathom the difference .
and ps , this is a perfect example of blood tithing ...
you insisting that right wingers are as bloody as the __name1__ .
that is blood libel , you know .
a victory on __name1__ soil is not in the same league as conquering the u.s.
we have had victories in __name1__ and __name2__ but we have not taken over the land .
one might say that __name1__ won a victory on __name2__ @/@ __name2__ , but in reality all that happened was that __name3__ suffered a terrorist attack .
if a victory is won by simply killing people then you can say they won a victory .
my definition of a victory in war is winning the battle and pushing your enemy out of the territory which was fought for .
i do not believe the __name1__ @/@ __name1__ terrorists accomplished that task .
nor have i seen any proof that those who are associated with the so @-@ called __name1__ were in anyway associated with the murderers of __name2__ @/@ __name2__ .
you say that this is a statement by them .
maybe that would be the case if they were actually planning on building on the grounds of the __name1__ .
how far away is far enough ?
__quant1__ blocks ?
__quant1__ blocks ?
all of __name1__ ?
how about all of __name1__ state ?
immie ?
it does n't matter .
they brought down the very symbol of __name1__ capitalist culture .
the twin towers .
they at the time almost caused an economic collapse .
to them it was good enough .
why was the initial __name1__ name of this mosque called ' __name1__ project '?
why was it changed later ?
i know why !
pick me !
i know you spoke with passion , allie , but it is upsetting to read " stop supporting terrorists , madeline ".
a false allegation , allie .
unless you happen to think that freedom of religion = supporting terrorists .
you stepped on my feelings a bit there , girl .
so if a crime begins and ends with the criminal , according to __name1__ ,
does that mean that in the case of a __name1__ being murdered in medieval times by someone who had heard the stories of jews killing children for their blood ( the blood libel of __name2__ 's speech )
that crime only began and ended with the murderer and his act ?
that crime did n't begin with the stories concocted to demonize __name1__ ?
that crime did n't begin with vitriolic , inflammatory , inciteful rhetoric spread through that society ?
really ?
did she really intend to refute her own argument in the same speech ? ????
what are you parsing ?
what point are you trying to relay ?
you are mixing events .
as to the mosque genius ?
the __name1__ people have an aversion to allowing the religion of the killers from that day holding sacred ground .
or are n't you that fucking bright and showing your lackluster brillience at being a statist moron ?
there 's a different sort of blood libel .
i just answered you .
she 's not a hypocrite ?
why not ?
dude do n't ask me vacant leading questions like that .
you wanna discuss this or just emote and play games ?
__quant1__ answered the query of gth a page or __quant2__ back , ....
here , becasue i like you , i 'll re @-@ post it right here ;
whatever .
jeezus what is wrong with people ?
dude , tell me about it
here we are dissecting a sermonette from someone who got rolled , trashed , burned and taken to the cleaners in a day and half by everyone from __name2__ __name1__ and wapo to __name2__ real honest to goodness pajama laden denizen of grannies basement blogger ...
i mean the gall ?
how dare she barge into a story to defend herself against charges of inspiring murder ?
oh come on madeline , of all people , you should understand this issue .
here 's a question for you :
if someone were to propose tearing down __name1__ or the __name2__ memorial and replacing it with an " earth @-@ friendly __name3__ car dealership "....
how would you react ?
come come now ...
be truthful .
seems to me the proper analogy is how would i feel if someone tore down a __name1__ and built a house of worship ?
why was n't this land " sacred " before the __name1__ wanted to build a new mosque ?
how " sacred " is the land next door , which sports a titty bar ?
just as i thought ...
you 're avoiding the question .
i 'll ask again , just to watch the next dance you do to avoid it .
this analogy involves land that was not deemed " sacred " before __name1__ , but now is .
the analogy is appropriate .
that is the worst analogy ever .
dude , tell me about it ,
" how dare she barge into a story to defend herself against charges of inspiring murder ? "
is that what she was doing ?
cus i thought she was using this as a means to demonize liberals and democrats and show her mindless minions that liberals and democrats are really evil and really deserve what ever they get ...
( even death )
my bad
i am merely showing the illogic and inconsistency in what she said , point by point , fact by fact ( and which no one is so far disputing , so what i 'm saying is apparently indisputable ) .
what 's wrong , exactly , with what i 'm doing ?
yet that same __name1__ dealer will go to an nra gun show and sell bumper stickers that say ;
make __name1__ a better place , kill a liberal · and " hunting permit for liberals " · and stickers that show a donkey with a target on its ' back
is that decent and respectful ?
you seriously think the left does n't have equally distasteful bumper stickers ?
yup · i did a very thorough search on line for ;
liberal and democratic bumper stickers
and
conservative @/@ republican bumper stickers
i found many sites for both .
from the liberals i found things like ;
save the whales · stop polluting · hate is not a family value · etc....
from the conservative sites i found ;
nuke liberals · nuke __name1__ · nuke __name2__ · club liberals , not ( sandwhiches , seals ) · make __name3__ a better place , kill a liberal · i accelerate for liberals · liberal hunting permits · targets with pictures of liberals ( __name4__ , hilliary ) on them
transparent agenda ...
you 're doin ' it right .
__name1__ said , specifically that journalists and pundits were
" manufacturing a blood libel that serves only to incite the very hatred and violence they purport to condemn ."
she is thus stating , unequivocally , her opinion that journalists @/@ pundits can in fact incite violence with their words .
but she also says :
acts of monstrous criminality stand on their own .
they begin and end with the criminals who commit them , not collectively with all the citizens of a state , not with those who listen to talk radio , not with maps of swing districts used by both sides of the aisle
thus contradicting what she said above that .
in short , she does n't have a clue what she 's talking about .
i am not defending her .
i have not read what she said beyond this site nor do i care what she said .
however , the way i see it is that by blaming the pundits i.e. " hate speech ", rather than jared lee loughner , we are taking away the focus on what it should be and that is that mr. __name1__ committed murder and quite frankly i believe he was mentally disturbed .
if any blame should be placed on anyone 's shoulders besides __name1__ 's it should be placed on the shoulders of the people and places that refused to help a man who needed help mentally .
i do not believe that anyone can successfully argue that this man was not mentally disturbed .
blaming politicians , pundits and internet speech is not the answer here .
the focus should not be upon us being more civil to each other ( although it would be nice if we were ) but rather on what caused __name1__ to snap last saturday .
i must say convincing me that our incivility to each other played any kind of a part in this will take a miracle .
immie
i have n't really seen anyone make that either @/@ or distinction .
i 've yet to hear anyone exonerate __name1__ of his crimes on the grounds that the media , not he , was solely to blame .
yup ...
why do n't you do it for yourself ?
are you afraid of reality ?
not a thing .
however ; seen in the light of the fav .
bugaboo de juer , the big " h ", how much energy did you expend on her behalf or anyone 's for that matter who was accused of driving this guy over the edge into a murderous rage when in fact it was none of the above , zip nada bupkas ...
and had nothing to do with the right or left , not __name1__ and her graphic , not __name2__ 's rage against __name3__ etc etc etc.?
no one really wants to talk about anythiing else .
that 's why i 'm talking about this .
but she also says :
i do not think anyone is doing it deliberately or even saying so .
i think that when we point fingers at everyone else we are exonerating him ...
basically it is the unintentional consequences of casting blame on everyone else .
that is how i see what is happening , anyway .
if crimes " begin and end with the criminals who commit them , "....
__value1__ you 'll have to explain what one has to do with the other .
ps : i have n't read through the thread , just the op.
the __name1__ church also had a propensity to build churches on lands that had been conquered by christian armys , etc.
hell , the __name1__ church converted __name2__ and __name3__ at the point of a sword .
is n't that what i said ?
see highlighted parts .
__quant1__ posts and you can n't figure it out ?
i do n't need to figure it out .
one has nothing to do with the other and the very premise of the question is a non @-@ sequitur .
if others here were stupid enough to take the bait then that 's just more of the same .
you are somehow equating the religion of a set of perpertators to a henous crime ...
that seem right to you , in the land of the free ?
the mosque is n't on the sacred site of a mass murder .
it 's located at the formerly sacred __name1__
as well as being as close to ground zero as they could get , correct .
the mosque is located at the hallowed ground that used be known as __name1__ , just a few doors down from the sacred pussycat lounge
i 've worshiped at both locations .
i think your confused the pussycat lounge had woman dancing .
i guess the families of the __name1__ victims who wanted the mosque to be built arent legitimate .
in wingnuts mind , they probably helped plan the attack that killed their loved one .
of course they helped , do you believe that the moslems who started this war were alone .
i was unaware the families of the hijackers came together to build a mosque .
hey , if you can n't think laterally , or want to be the messageboard pedant , then have at it .
go troll some other thread fool .....
what great victory did the __name1__ acheive at the sacred __name2__ ?
i ask because i 'm concerned that they may have taken over the pussycat lounge , two door down .
i worship there regularly
is that the depth of your argument ?
do you know why the imam chose the building ?
you are aware that it 's being hit on __name1__ @/@ __name1__ was a factor in his decission right ?
you do know the signifficance of it originnally being the " __name1__ project " right ?
are you aware of __name2__ tradition in building mosques at the site of great victories for __name1__ ?
do you have any idea what that will mean to our enemies , what they could do with it , and why we closed and deported shinto priests who had a shrine near one of the sites attacked in __year1__ ?
links please .
btw , just as a side note .
if i was to click on your name and check out what forums you post in , they would n't be conspiracy theory ones would they ?
if so , i 'll bow out now ...
if the history of the __name1__ shrines in hi from the __name1__ shrines will do , including the lawsuit they filed and won to get the property back after the war ...
by __year1__ , __quant1__ festivals were being celebrated for all __quant2__ shrines ; __name1__ , __name2__ and otaki jinja , with an ever @-@ growing membership of over 1,200 families .
however , the __name1__ attack on __name2__ on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ threw the whole nation into turmoil .
in the worst abuse of government authority in the history of the __name3__ , more than 120,000 __name2__ __name1__ were interned in relocation camps .
__name2__ leaders of the community in __name1__ were immediately rounded up and sent to internment camps on __name3__ , __name4__ , __name5__ , __name6__ , __name7__ , __name9__ , the __name8__ and the mainland .
all religious and cultural activities were terminated as the war continued .
in __year1__ , the interned rev. isobe was deported to __name1__ , forcing officers to call a special meeting on __month1__ __day1__ , __year2__ to decide the fate of the shrine .
__name1__ officially announced the temporary closure of the shrine and its activities on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ .
after the war , members enthusiastically restored shrine activities on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ , despite the absence of a priest .
however , the shrine faced another crisis on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ , when its property was seized by the federal government .
an emergency meeting was called and a special committee formed to initiate measures for the return of the shrine and its property .
on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ , an announcement for the sale of the __name1__ property appeared on local newspapers .
the shrine immediately solicited the services of the law firm , robertson , castle & anthony and filed a suit on __day1__ , __year1__ against attorney general __name1__ , the state of __name2__ and the federal alien land office .
the case was heard in __name1__ on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ with a favorable ruling for the shrine .
__name1__ was once again able to continue all activities at their property in __name2__ .
members jubilantly celebrated the __name1__ on sunday , __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ , __quant1__ long years since the last festival in __year2__
__name4__ __name1__ kotohira __name4__ __name3__ dazaifu tenmangu </a>
i thought it was pretty much well known .
this is not unprecedented anyone believing it is , does not know history very well .
no , i 'm after the links that said the iman wanted to build a mosque at ground zero due to __name1__ @-@ 11..
your inability to refute the truth is nothing to be ashamed of .
afterall , it is the truth and all .
and your ability to troll threads in order to garner attention upon yourself is legendary .
but carry on !
for the same reason the local __name1__ dealer would not open up a store in the same strip mall where __quant1__ people got shot , __quant2__ killed .
it 's the decent and respectful thing to do .
so what does it then say about __name1__ 's having just accepted an invitation to speak at a gun show immediately after the az shootings ?
that she has no decency and respect ?
was the gun show at the strip mall where the shootings occurred ?
was it even in the same city ?
how about state ?
brilliant question , geauxtohell .
this theory demands that we buy into the theory that the __name1__ @-@ __name1__ perps were just nutters and in no way were they motivated by the hatemonging they were exposed to , right ?
that theory makes about as much sense ( read none ) as the theory that this perp killed the politician for no reason other than he was crazy , i suppose .
you 're right ...
he may have had a wedgy
the night before the rampage , authorities say , __name1__ , __quant1__ , dropped off at a drugstore a roll of __quant2__ @-@ millimeter film containing images he had shot of himself posing with a __name2__ semiautomatic pistol while wearing a red g @-@ string
__value1__ href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/us/15giffords.html?_r=2&pagewanted=1&hp&adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1295035206-ruizhksnkwumbsmhzblkaa"> http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/15/us...kwumbsmhzblkaa </a>
attempting to assign a motive to this nutbag is just silly .
to the op and those that seem to be in agreement with it 's bogus implication ...
willful ignorance and half @-@ baked hyperbolic nonsense is not a compelling argument .
let me help you out .
he is saying that the right blames crimes committed by __name2__ on __name2__ rhetoric while claiming that " conservative " rhetoric has no effect on anyone .
i know .
and it 's still bogus for __quant1__ reasons .
1 ) nobody says conservative rhetoric has no effect on anyone .
in fact , it 's desired effect is to influence how people vote and it does an ok job in that regard .
2 ) to compare any __name1__ political rhetoric , no matter how allegedly ' violent , ' to the edicts issued by obl and other __name2__ terrorist leaders is about as fucking retarded as it gets .
take a step out of the trees once in a while and look at the forest .
there is absolutely no evidence that supports obl or terrorists being connected to the mosque in question .
use a ladder next time and climb out of the tree instead of falling on your head .
what part of the reality that __name1__ terrorists use their religion to justify their terror , murder and mayhem , do n't you grasp ?
and what part of of the reality that christians use their religion to justify their terror , murder and mayhem do n't you grasp ?
i did n't say there was .
try reading for comprehension next time .
can explain how you connect the ground zero mosque and violent crimes committed by __name1__ terrorists ?
i do n't believe there is one but you seem feel differently about it .
okay everyone !
manifold says this is a non @-@ issue .
might as well pack it up ..............
the " effect " people are talking about is n't simple political rhetoric designed to sway votes .
it 's whether or not political rhetoric can cause people to do violence .
i actually think __name1__ acted the way he did out of some sort of form of psychosis .
i do n't blame __name1__ , __name2__ , __name2__ , or anyone else for the crazy things that crazy people do .
you obviously missed the point of the op.
for the record ( and those slow on the uptake ) , i am not comparing __name1__ political rhetoric to anything that comes out of obl 's mouth .
so i agree with your last sentence .
the point is this : __name1__ made a stink about the mosque that is __quant1__ blocks away from ground zero due to the fact that it was close to ( as we all know ) the site of the twin towers that were destroyed by fanatical __name2__ terrorists .
the people behind the mosque had nothing to do with the __month1__ @-@ __day1__ attack .
however , they were held accountable for it all the same .
then , __quant2__ year or so later , some crazy asshole in __name1__ shoots up a bunch of people , to include a __quant1__ year old girl and a congresswoman , and the left wing punditry ( erroneously ) claims __name2__ is inciting these events with her " vitriol " and shares some blame over the event .
__name1__ get 's all high and fucking mighty and makes the statement : " crimes begin and end with the people who commit them ".
see the hypocrisy ?
ok , thanks for the explanation .
however , i believe i 've found the disconnect and bolded it above .
i do not recall anyone suggesting that those behind the ground zero mosque were to be held accountable for __name1__ @/@ __name1__ .
if there were , my guess is it was a tiny tiny fringe minority .
but by all means , provide some links and prove me wrong .
i 'd be much obliged if you can .
there have been plenty of posts in this thread , with links , that argue that the people behind the mosque should be held accountable for __name1__ @/@ __name1__ .
why do n't you ask for something else that has already been posted ?
he designed his mosque ...
oh , yeah , he must be a terrorist .
and hosts a web site extolling his virtues ....
i guess you sort of left that out .
indeed .
link ?
<a href="http://www.sakeenah.org/celebrate.shtml"> sakeenah : celebrating goodness </a>
not hard to find seeing as how the links were identified in news stories .
i guess its one of those things you actually have to not want to know to avoid knowing ...
good job on that !
if they are n't being held accountable , then why would anyone give a damn if they build a mosque within a __quant1__ block radius of ground zero ?
personally , i didnt ' give a crap about the mosque .
but i can understand how some might have found it insensitive .
but i do n't see how finding it insensitive constitutes holding those behind it accountable for __name1__ @/@ __name1__ .
they are accountable for their own actions , and when those actions either by design or by consequence aid or abbet an enemy in war they are accountable for it .
the only question would be whether or not it 's by design or consequence as in the former they could be held criminally responsible for treason and in the latter civily responsable for whatever damages are incurred from their negligence ( which may also be criminal ) .
unless of course you are of the legal opinion that a person is not responsible for unintended malconsequence resulting from their actions ( and in some cases innaction ) , which would be wrong .
how is it insensitive if the mosque has nothing to do with the __name1__ @/@ __name1__ terrorists ?
good one !
i see another wingnut is too scared to defend his own words
why do wingnuts always run when challenged ?
as far as i can tell it would mean that people who had nothing to do with __name1__ @/@ __name1__ were doing a victory dance for something that they had nothing to do with .
oh , i 'm sorry .
i did n't realize you were being serious .
i did in fact laugh out loud when i read your post .
the answer seems obvious to me , but let me give you an analogy that might help you out ...
how would it be insensitive for me to call a black man a nigger if i had nothing to do with slavery ?
suss that out and maybe you 'll get it .
yup .
and i agree that it 's a pretty silly accusation , but believing this and also believing that crime begins and ends with those who commit them is not contradictory or hypocritical , as the op implies .
good one !
last time i went by the area , the mosque was n't calling black people " nigger ".
please explain how it is insensitive to build a mosque on the former site of the __name1__
i can n't explain why something that does n't offend me is offensive .
but neither you nor i get to tell other people what they are allowed to find offensive .
again , the point i 'm trying to make is that being offended by the mosque and also believing crime begins and ends with the criminals who commit them is not contradictory or hypocritical , no matter how much you and geaux want to pretend that it is .
gee , earlier you said that building the mosque is insensitive and that the reason was obvious and simple .
now , it 's suddenly impossible for you to explain why it 's insensitive
keep dancing
those responsible for __name2__ @/@ __name2__ were __name1__
those who want to build a mosque are __name1__
some view this as insensitive .
that much seems obvious , you hacktard .
it 's the why that i can n't explain .
but you 've clearly demonstrated that you are incapable of objectivity and it 's been duly noted .
thanks for showing your hand so easily ...
i agree with you , quantum windbag , and so do most legal commentators i have read .
there does n't seem to be any novel con law question presented on these facts and it 's a puzzler why the __name1__ took the cert .
have you read the 4 th __name1__ opinion and the transcript of yesterday 's questioning ?
it seems the __name1__ is looking at whether the 4 th __name2__ was correct in disregarding the public v . private nature of the individuals and event and focusing on the type of speech instead .
there 's also a side issue of amicus waivers .
interesting stuff if you have n't looked at it .
the attorney for the church is the daughter of the nut case pastor .
the public v . private nature is the argument for the church as the ruling in the __name1__ v . __name2__ case is what they are hanging their entire argument on .
how they can claim the father of the soldier is a public figure is absurd .
that is the entire case .
the father is not a public figure and is a private citizen .
the jury verdict must stand .
actually what they 're arguing if you read it closely is that __name1__ should be expanded to private individuals , or conversely that the definition of public figure should be changed to include anyone who has personal information available publicly - in this case , through the deceased 's obituary .
why they dropped the sufficient evidence objection and it had to be raised on amicus is beyond me , that 's the key to the entire case .
the __name1__ people were never suspected to be all that bright though .
eta : on the other hand , the snyders are arguing they were a captive audience at the funeral , when they testified they never even knew the __name1__ was there during the funeral .
both sides could have used better attorneys on this , the arguments dance around the real issues and ignore the facts - on both sides .
no , may i have a link ?
i wonder where they are going with this ...
sure sounds like libel and slander is gonna get refined , eh ?
nah , the __name1__ got a summary judgment on defamation at he district level and the snyders never appealed .
they won on intentional infliction of emotional distress and civil conspiracy .
so handle them the same way we handle the freaks that harass women going into clinics - establish a mandatory buffer zone around the site and let them spew whatever they want from outside that perimeter .
it worked in the snyder case .
the __name1__ assholes were kept a few __quant1__ yards away , they got to wave their little signs and the family never even knew they were there .
i can see mebbe clarifying when someone becomes a " public figure " for purposes of libel and slander law -- but even that is a stretch , as i am not persuaded anything the __name1__ wrote on its signs or shouted at passers by could be legally regarded as libelous .
beyond that , i am not convinced the __name1__ can find anything new to say about the __name2__ on these facts .
" harrassment " is a matter of criminalizing conduct , not speech .....
i doubt the synder family could have filed a police report on the __name1__ for any harrassment type crime in connection with their son 's funeral .
how can a reasonable person be " put in fear , etc." by a protest they were not aware of until the paper reported on it the next day ?
actually if you read the decision the snyders were awarded $ __quant1__ ( reduced to $ 2.1million ) not because of the newspaper coverage , but because mr. snyder sought out and watched the __name1__ 's " documentary " video of the protest on their website .
true story .
the 4 th __name1__ used milkovich as their primary case with cantwell quoted as the secondary .
but what they actually overturned the __name1__ on was sending the question of law as to whether the speech should have __name2__ protection to the jury rather than deciding it from the bench - which is what they did by focusing on type of speech rather than nature of speaker and audience and concluded it was protected .
the only problem may be that they used __name1__ in their tort analysis after saying public v . private did n't matter .
the concurrence at the __name1__ level also raises the ( valid , imo ) point of lack of sufficient evidence to prove harm but on an amicus waiver , over which there seems to be some confusion .
that 's an interesting side issue that may be addressed .
cool stuff .
here 's the 4 th __name1__ decision if you have n't read it .
it 's a __name1__ but you do n't need __name2__ access :
__value1__ href="http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/081026.p.pdf"> http://pacer.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinion.pdf/081026.p.pdf </a>
excellent .
the court must take into consideration the technology of the times in their ruling .
i just had a case where a youth committed suicide and the bullies posted more negative crap about this kid on the web site dedicated to a memorial for the youth .
the parents of the youth would go on the web site to see all the kind remarks about their child and then see the negative crap also .
usually free speech cases like these take a long time to rule on and do not have split decisions .
that 's just crazy talk !
*laughs*
thankies for the link !
of course they are because without the " expansion " they have no argument .
however , they argued yesterday that tv interviews the father gave " expanded " the father to a piblic figure from a private one de facto .
the problem i have here is that the __name1__ 's site is n't a memorial site for matthew snyder , it is their own property to disseminate their point of view .
by the time mr. snyder did his __name2__ search he knew from media sources __name1__ had been present , but he chose voluntarily to view it anyway .
iied is a very narrow and hard to win tort for a reason , you do n't want to open the door to multi __quant1__ dollar judgments for anyone who says something that hurts a person 's feelings , whether directed at them or not , whether made in their presence or not , whether intent to harm that individual is real or whether it is a promotional piece for their movement and the intent to harm is simply imputed because the offended party went out of his way to find it .
if this were any group other than __name1__ , would you feel the same way ?
think about that , because whatever ruling comes down will affect all religious , quasi @-@ political and groups out there as far as whether they can picket , protest , or use any material on their website or in their publications naming groups or individuals or that could be considered offensive to named groups or individuals .
it 's the voluntary and knowing nature of mr. snyder 's exposure that bugs me .
i just do n't feel comfortable with expanding iied that far , __name1__ assholes or no.
i am surprised the __name1__ is not representing the __name2__ . doubtless they 'll file an amicus brief .
if the parties ' lawyers have fucked up the law and the facts , this is __quant1__ more reason why __name1__ normally would not grant cert .
there has to be a present risk of harm , editec .
reasonable time , place and manner restrictions on __name1__ rights are constitutional , but only if they pass muster on this point .
__value1__ href="http://ftp.resource.org/courts.gov/c/f2/771/771.f2d.920.82-1913.82-1865.html"> 771 f.2d 920 </a>
and those already existing time place and manner restrictions were utilized at matthew snyder 's funeral , with the result that the family never even knew __name1__ was there .
so why do we need broad new restrictions on speech , or liability expanded for speech , when existing restrictions already work ?
apparently the restrictions did not work as harm was done .
it was proven in a lower court by a judge .
granted that was overruled in a higher court , that is how we got here .
i highly doubt the __name1__ took this case , only to agree with the appeals decision .
a narrow ruling with a ban on political speech focused on a private individual without a political opinion on the speech in question does no harm .
in this case , the soldier was the private individual and could not speak in his own defense .
i think something about private events that have no reasonable expectation of being completely out of the public might be part of it .
i 'm not so sure .
to my knowledge iied has n't been expanded anywhere to cover knowing and voluntary viewing of offensive material in the media or online , but with all the tort cases out there it 's hard to say for sure .
i 'm uncomfortable with it though , for a lot of reasons .
the example of defacing a memorial site that gadawg brought up is __quant1__ thing , that 's essentially vandalism of another person 's property and the parents would be viewing it unawares .
but what about when the " victim " voluntarily seeks out a site knowing in advance the content will be offensive and then claims __quant1__ because he was in fact offended ?
there are a couple other problems with this argument .
the __value1__ is the sufficiency of the evidence , which was considered so vital on appeal it caused a split in the bench not over whether the evidence was sufficient but whether they could rule it was insufficient on an amicus waiver ( read the 4 th __name1__ ruling ) .
the __value1__ being that the question of whether the speech was protected , a question of law , was given to the jury - which is only to determine questions of fact .
the judge is to hear arguments and determine all questions of law .
that alone pretty much guarantees this will be remanded for either summary judgment or retrial - under what instructions is what remains to be seen .
the court has both liberal and conservative points to make .
the opinions will be interesting .
the church is going to lose .
tough case , but privacy and harassment enter the picture too .
<a href="http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/rightofprivacy.html"> the right of privacy : is it protected __name1__ the constitution ? </a>
or we may see snyder v . phelps __value1__ coming soon to a court near you ....
stay tuned .
well said but i trust the jury verdict .
they are the voice and interpreters of this tort and did their duty .
this is about a family and their grief __value1__ and religion , or lack of it as __name1__ clearly shows , plays no part in it for me .
calling for people to commit crimes against a group is hate speech .
basically it 's a kind of incitment to riot and it ought to be illegal .
by statute as you indicated .
excellent .
very good thread here sports fans .
the only problem with trusting the jury on this one is that they were given a question of law to determine .
it was left up to them to decide whether the __name1__ applied .
no jury should be deciding questions of law , those are to be decided by the judge prior to giving the case to the jury to determine the questions of fact .
so if the jury was in fact instructed incorrectly , chances are they will not come to the correct conclusion .
the jury instruction given on this clearly put the question of __name1__ protection in their laps .
i still think for this reason alone it will be remanded for a new trial with instructions no matter what the outcome , unless __name1__ wins outright ( probably not ) in which case it will be remanded for summary judgment .
there was n't a jury verdict based on the proper findings from the proper source .
nor should the jury be interpreting the nature and scope of the tort - again , that is a question of law .
the jury is to be instructed as to the law to be applied to the facts they determine , not the other way around .
determining the law and instructing the jury in that law is what the judge is for .
respectfully , i have investigated over 1000 cases for trial in __quant1__ years .
the jury is charged on the law and in this case material fact was the free speech 1 st __name1__ protection .
that is a jury decision as to the facts : · __name1__ v . howell " the jury must beleft perfectly free in reaching a conclusion upon the testimony introduced , untrammeled by any intimidation from the judge as to whether a certain fact at issue has been proved or not " · concerning the 1 st __name2__ __name3__ argument and jury charges by a judge : · norris v . clinkscales " a judge violates this provision when he expresses in his charge his own opinion upon the force and effect of the testimony , or any part of it , or intimates his views of the sufficiency or insufficiency of the evidence , in whole or in part .
under the __name1__ the force and effect , or weight and sufficiency , of testimony and facts must be left exclusively to the jury , uninfluenced by any expression or intimation of opinion on the __name2__ __name3__ or any other __name3__ .
the whole family are lawyers .
right .
the jury has full power over questions of fact , of evidence and testimony , weight and credibility .
the judge can n't influence them in any way over that .
this is different from questions of law .
for example , the jury does n't decide whether an objection is sustained or overruled .
they do n't decide what evidence is admissible .
they do n't decide what the law says , they are told what it says and they are to determine the facts exactly as you have described and apply those to the law as they are instructed by the judge in order to reach a conclusion .
what types of speech are covered by the __name1__ is not a question of fact for a jury to determine .
it 's settled law that is to be determined by the judge and then the jury instructed as to what speech is and is not protected and under what circumstances .
they then go over all the facts , evidence and testimony and decide whether those facts as they determine them fit the law as they were instructed .
we are on the same page .
i know the rules of evidence .
you fail to understand they were already past that when this went totrial .
the jury was charged on the law .
what is free speech is a judicial decision and that is where they are now , only after appeal .
but the __name1__ , where the 1 st __name2__ is , does not allow judcial interpretation at trial on issues of material facts in evidence .
that is a jury issue .
did you read jury instruction 21 in the 4 th __name1__ opinion ?
if not you should .
to paraphrase ( there 's a link in one of my earlier posts on page __value1__ , i think ) the jury was simply told the level of protection varies on the type of speech , with no instruction on what the levels are or what types do and do not receive protection .
and yet the level of protection for different types of speech is a matter of law , not fact .
so the jury was in fact given a question of law to determine - the judge did not spell out the law but left it up to the jury to decide what is and is not protected speech .
see the problem here ?
shows the statists all around the country .
fucking emotional pussies
i think an __name1__ ruling on where speech becomes harassment might be helpful though .
i dunno .
it 's a very , very hard one .
i do n't want free speech curtailed , but i also loathe the actions of these guys ....
and those that harass women going into abortion clinics .
there are better ways to speak your mind than to scream like banshees at ordinary people going about their private business .
the case before the court would not allow that sort of finding from the facts , because the family never saw , or heard , phelps and his church .
i would think that harassment has to be immediate before it is actionable .
they heard it after the fact quantum .
harm seems to have been established in the lower courts .
i think drawing a bystander into a political speech for your benefit and the other private party 's harm is the key here .
i think you have that backward .
snyder is the one pinning his whole case on the public @/@ private division , and the news about that funeral was very public .
the family even invited the __name1__ , making it even more public .
__name1__ is getting sued by a grieving parent .
what the fuck law or act ( of __name1__ or of a state ) is even implicated ?
freedom of speech has never been understood to restrict the ability of people to sue other people for things like libel and slander .
it cannot be properly understood in that way , in fact .
only the so @-@ called " 1 st __name1__ ' absolutists '" think in such ridiculous terms .
so if a citizen can sue another citizen over something said or written , then why can n't a citizen sue another citizen for the intentional infliction of emotional injury caused by the outrageous conduct of the party getting sued ?
if the plaintiff succeeds in the lawsuit at the __name2__ level , there will have been __quant1__ violation of the __name1__ 's guarantee of freedom of speech .
the fucking scumbags of __name1__ will merely have had their depraved , disgusting and outrageous behavior properly called into account .
they remain perfectly free to express their idiotic beliefs either way .
fuck them .
god hates them .
i know .
he told me so .
how much free speech will anyone have if someone can sue anytime they are offended ?
i like how free speech rights all point to protecting objectionable speech .
free speech was meant to protect a political minority from the majority in getting their message heard .
it was not meant to protect pornographers , hate speech against a minority or politically motivated attacks on a small group of private citizens , who are not even part of that discussion .
some speech is simply unnecessary to the ends of a political debate .
i expect that the ruling will fall on the time tested principle of liberty up to the point it displaces the liberty of another .
so , if i print up a political track that talks about sex in a graphic manner , that is fine , but if i leave politics out , is is n't ?
how exactly is that supposed to work ?
they can n't sue just because they are offended and that was not the basis here .
harm from deliberately seeking out offensive material .
that is like me going in the store and asking for a __name1__ , and then demanding my money back because it contained pornography .
i do n't think that will fly .
the point was , free speech many times is protecting something that is objectionable for no other reason than that .
i fail to see how political discourse is harmed in its true form by dropping the pretense that objectionable stuff can protect the other .
slander is action against against an offensive statement that claims to be true .
the statement that god killed mathew snyder because he hates fags , and demonstrates that hatred by killing __name1__ soldiers who defend fags , is extremely hateful , and demonstratively offensive , but i doubt it meets the legal definition of slander .
the jury had the chance to hit back at a bunch of despicable people for a horrific belief , but those beliefs , and their right to express them , is a fundamental right in this country .
you may not like it , but it also helps you say the exact same type of thing about phelps and his church .
i have some good friends that ride with the __name1__ .
at age __quant1__ , the more i think about it and the madder i get , to hell with the __name1__ rulings .
baseball bat to the head of a __name1__ protestor would make me feel better .
i 've shown up to counter protest at a few funerals myself , i understand the feeling .
and if the case were different , if it were about their actual conduct at the funeral and getting in the family 's face , i 'd be on your side completely .
maybe it 's the lawyer side of me taking over and reminding me to step back and look at this objectively , without regard for the parties involved .
because that 's how whatever comes out will be applied in the future ....
objectively and without regard for the parties involved .
yes , they have to decide the case in front of them , but it will be applied as precedent to all kinds of situations .
if the facts were different then it would be so easy to say i want those bastards to pay and feel justified in doing so .
but they 're not , and you have to take the case you get .
my __name1__ temper is in check , somewhat .
i was there when my brother came back from __name1__ in __year1__ after __quant1__ tours and the community acted like he was n't there , saw the hooray parades for __name2__ which was great to see but made me even madder because of what my brother went through and now this bunch of clowns .
keep in mind also that i despise all religous kooks .
i quit riding __quant1__ ago otherwise __quant1__ would be there with them .
heard some true stories but when asked publicly i go to my sgt. schultz routine .
been to __quant1__ where they showed up , __quant2__ where they said they were coming but did n't .
i 'm a firm believer in nonviolence myself , but i hear nothing , i see nothing , i know nothing .
you can do that now but a jury will not allow damages unless the case is strong .
as this one is because we have a grieving family and the chyrch actions are outrageous and not the norm of just " offending " someone .
it is nice to think that , but juries have allowed damages to people that fell through the roof breaking into stores .
where exactly do you think the line between outrageous and offensive is ?
does it exist only for positions you think are offensive ?
can i draw it for positions you think are right ?
the further down that slope we go , the harder it is to pull back .
it is a lot easier to not start down it at all .
you are right .
there may be better ways , but these scum bags won't get the same attention , by using them .
i guess it will be up to the victims to start designing ways to have privacy , without an arena for the scum of the earth ......
that is the whole point of my op.
people can insulate themselves from speech they find particularly offensive a lot easier than society can step in and define what is , and is not , offensive .
the whole controversy over pornography is a perfect example of this .
when the court ruled that pornography was anything that did not have socially redeeming qualities the result was far from what all the people who set out to protect us from ourselves wanted .
instead of eliminating an entire industry , we ended up with an era of porn that included a short disclaimer about the social perils of promiscuous sex , and the exact same movie we would have seen before the ruling .
a simple voice over changed it from porn to permitted speech .
why is it that __name1__ will bend over backwards to appease the __name2__ country 's ?
why is that we must walk around such issues like the 9 @/@ 11 __name1__ , and the __name2__ qur’an bonfire ?
is it from fear of an attack from a peaceful religion , it 's a known fact they have killed __name1__ before without any provocation in the past .
like some of these attacks from the following link .
__value1__ href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/target/etc/cron.html"> __value1__ : target america : terrorist attacks on __year1__ , __year2__ @-@ 1988 </a>
not sure how we appease __name1__ countries .
no one is walking around the mosque issue .
hell , its been a huge discussion for both sides of the issue .
theres nothing wrong with that .
thats the __name1__ way .
the __name2__ __name1__ burning has been the hot button issue of the last __quant1__ weeks .
not walking around that .
to say people fear something because they discuss events is just not correct .
to hate another people because of their religious beliefs is fear .
im not afraid of anothers religious belief or color or creed or sexual preference .
i love __name1__ and fear nothing .
glad to hear that you do not fall into the media and __name1__ hype of fear .
if the crazy preac hers burns a few __name1__ books so what if they get piss so what ?
if they kill so what ?
that was their plan all along .
they do not need a reason to kill .
watching __name1__ has made you stupid , dude .
i do n't understand why we do n't purposely piss everyone off ....
who do they think they are anyways ?
do n't they know we rule the world ?

<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5wwc9eq1u0"> you tube </a>
supporting __name1__ has made you delusional son
according to the imam behind the mosque they can not move it , because moving it will lead to anger , hate , and violence around the world .
from so called tolerant , peaceful __name1__ .
lol
noted so what else is new ?
" to know a person 's religion we need not listen to his profession of faith but must find his brand of intolerance ."
__name1__
the idiocy inherent in this op is that somehow tolerance and respect for all religions is a bad thing .
no one is bending anywhere , this is __name1__ , there is religious freedom , is that not clear by now .
the __name1__ element on the right wants to limit freedom for all religions over __name2__ , they obviously know none of our history of interfering in other nations .
if you occupy or interfere in a nation 's internal situation you open yourself up to retaliation .
have any of the idiots who hate __name1__ ever turned their hatred on doctor killers in this nation , on __name2__ a __name3__ who killed many , or __name4__ , another catholic , who thankfully was less successful ?
the same narrow minded idiocy that fills the heads of these murderers fills the heads of those who cannot respect all people .
hatred and stupidity have no national or religious bounds .
humankind is still a primitive animal who can kill over ideas that exist only in the mind .
" we __value1__ kill people with our minds , before we kill them with weapons .
whatever the conflict , the enemy is always the destroyer .
we 're on __name1__ 's side ; they 're barbaric .
we 're good , they 're evil .
war gives us a feeling of moral clarity that we lack at other times ."
__name1__ <a __name2__ fora.tv __name1__ keen : in the absence of god </a>
you do not respect all religions .
i will keep you in miond in the next bash christainity thread .
dumb ass .
i do n't see anyone walking around either issue .
both that iman , and that preacher have the right in this nation to do what they are proposing to do .
how wise these actions are in this present poisoned atmosphere of hate , both of the radical __name1__ , and the rightwind nuts in our nation is a subject of debate .
however , under our __name1__ , both have the right to do what they are proposing .
i might note that what i am seeing here is apparently the right wing thinks that the 1 st __name1__ can be suspended any time that it offends their prissy little sensibilities .
just because __name2__ does it do not think that of most __name1__ .
so , what youre saying is that its no big deal if the preacher burns the books even if they get pissed , right ?
what part of " a protected 1 st __name1__ right " do n't you understand ?
another anti @-@ __name1__ thread from the hate monger who wishes to see them all dead , whether they be man , woman , or child .
whether they be innocent or guilty of any sort of crime .
to put things into perspective , the __name1__ flew some airplanes into a couple buildings and we got angry .
we , on the other hand , in the forms of the __name1__ up to __year1__ and the __name2__ following that have redrawn the map of their region , knocked down and set up govenments , ruled , tried and condemned their citizens , imposed our culture and held up their beliefs as quaint , backward and provincial .
all things considered , if they did to us what we have done to them , there 'd be more mushroom clouds than oil derecks in the __name1__ .
isreal is the right homeland of the __name1__ .
the arabs were the killing mechine after __name1__ was removed .
we have done nothing but put things back in its rightful place .
wasnt directing the question to you .
fuck'em and if they want to kill over this kill'em
has anyone else ever noticed that whenever a group asks to be accepted and granted the same rights as everyone else , the reactionary right belly aches about " bending over backwards " to accommodate citizens and their rights ?
take a look at any of the anti @-@ gay marriage threads .
same meme .
women 's rights ?
civil rights ?
why the reactionaries all gripe about " bending over backwards ".
i guess the rights enjoyed by the reactionaries are somehow exclusive to that group and anyone else wanting equal treatment is just an annoyance .
i love the way the left belly aches and whines for equality but when they are in control theirs no such thing .
it 's their way or else .
i have concluded that many __name1__ have simply gone insane .
i 'm not saying that some dem 's are n't insane either , but not the same pathological egotistical insanity that now plagues the __name1__ party , and is why they have lost so much credibility .
the irony is that , though they pretend to defend this country , they are infact the ones that would cause it to go down if they had their way , because , every country would hate us , and we would be all alone and have nobody or nothing , if __name1__ policies were fully and comprehensibly instituted .
this post is a perfect example of moronic americanism , fueled %100 by current __name1__ ideology .
i conclude that you are insane .
tissue ?
__name1__ lion hearted would appreciate your world view .
that view might benefit from a consideration of the __name1__ .
i 've heard that the tora ( sp ? )
can be condensed to this __quant1__ thought : do not do to others what you would find hateful to yourself .
may or may not be right on this , but it seems pretty wise .
would you find it hateful for a foreign power to roll into the __name1__ , re @-@ name all of the states , re @-@ draw the borders according to nothing important to you , select and support a ruler not of your choosing and impose a culture dictating the dress codes , social conduct and education ?
if your answer is " yes ", you may be on the verge of understanding the past hostility of the __name1__ to the __name2__ .
the current situation is not the past , but the past is prologue .
that land is __name1__ 's land but even if they were not there someone would be trying to exterminate them .
just how is there no such thing as equality ?
are you being denied equal rights ?
can you please cite specifically where i 'm wrong and you are right on this issue ?
or are you just venting and whining because that 's just what you do ?
i am not the one who has cried about being treated unfairly .
the left do that all the time .
that 's not what you said !
need i remind you ?
it 's their way or else
it 's their way or else ?
what do you mean by that ?
and you 're not being treated unfairly , unless you are gay , a woman , an immigrant , or a minority and are forced to interact with a right wing extremist like you .
it is all about an election cycle .
you see the liberals think they can blame the __name1__ for the opposition to the mosque and the __name2__ burning and win political points .
they will say or do anything at this point cause they know they are in deep trouble .
bullshit .
on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ , __name1__ gave this speech .
__name1__ hatred has __quant1__ to do with " election cycles ."
he knew , as does president __name1__ , that it serves no good purpose to enflame an entire population because of the behavior of a few .
__name1__ href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_zorojdvna"> youtube - gwb 's __name2__ " islam is peace " speech </a>
yup that was when __name1__ decided to lie rather than educate .
sad moment , a disgrace really .
perhaps because we are supposed to be the ' adults ' on the planet .
maybe because __name1__ got this sort of mess out of its system when it was also about __quant1__ years old .
perhaps because we are supposed to be the ones who have found a place for religion somewhere below the mystic .
perhaps because we understand that __quant1__ wrongs ( or __quant2__ ) do n't make a single right .
perhaps it 's simply because , we prefer to hold individuals accountable for their actions and not the group they come from .
so ?
he should know .
do you think peaceful __name1__ are n't aware of what 's going on with the non @-@ peaceful brethren ?
i 'm guessing people who think like you ( and even pastor __name1__ ) have never been inside a church where the real meaning of __name2__ is discussed .
you left out that he 's a " __name1__ ."
uh huh ...
begs the question .
do we really bend over backwards to appease __name1__ countries ?
hell , lad , we 've invaded __quant1__ __name1__ nations recently .
is that what you call appeasement ?
i call what we are doing now appeasement .
there is no need to do that .
but when you elected a __name1__ as president that what you will get .
was __name1__ a muslim ?
good grief , they do n't come much dumber than you .
who 's a __name1__ i have laid no claims to that name .
you are either blind or just plain stupid yes __name2__ is a __name1__ and you are stupid for tring to spin this when you mention __name3__ .
so what are you demanding , you illiterate clown ?
it 's idiots like you who give southerners a bad reputation .
i could n't agree more .
frankly , it 's scary .
i am not demanding anything stop being an illiterate cunt .
some people are so devoid of knowledge they think they can win hearts and minds of __name1__ , anything that threatens that gossamer delusion is an act of anti __name2__ hate .
there was a failure with __name1__ directly after __name5__ @/@ __name5__ to make the case specifically addressing the ideology that put into actions that ended in the piles of ruble in __name2__ and __name3__ and a smoking hole in __name4__ .
this failure has been passed on __quant1__ .
the acts of __name4__ @/@ __name4__ were acts of fundamental __name1__ believers acting in accordance with the __name2__ and __name3__ .
the problem with that facts is those in " power ' have no answer to combat __name1__ .
since that day · those in power have lied continually to protect __name1__ from the __quant1__ attacks since __name2__ @/@ __name2__ · we have made no effort to promote the treasures of __name3__ commerce education and freedoms , we have devalued the dollar and capitalism out of existence.we had shackled our freedoms in an effort to make ourselves safe .
the __name1__ has been attacked as __name2__ is beheld as a jewel with an unblemished history .
our business are movie to __name1__ countries and our allies begin to take __name2__ less seriously and our government walks around in clownshoes with a red nose spouting more ridicules lies about the economy , its efforts and islam .
soon the government will have the full __name1__ suit on and the __name2__ will collapse all to protect a lies .
so what would you have done , genius ?
it 's scary they allow you on the compouter .
well at least they do n ot allow you access to any sharp pointy objects
you might be onto something if you were not such a hack .
everyone 's a political hack who posts on this message board .
duh ...
the only " hacking " done there was hacking to pieces the op because it defines clearly the ignorant groupthink of the right wing extremists .

why the reactionaries all gripe about " bending over backwards ?
because like most reactionaries they lack much creative imagination .
that 's in part why they 're reactionaries , actually .
meanwhile , out in the real world , this might be the kind of thing that the treaty would actually be meant to tackle :
<a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/oneworld/20060519/wl_oneworld/45361331031148010119"> missing guns raise __name1__ over u.s. arms dealings abroad </a>
__name2__ , oneworld __name1__ · thu __month1__ __day1__ , 11 @:@ __time1__ pm __timezone1__
the __name1__ government has lost track of over 200,000 machine guns that were supposed to be used by the __name2__ police , according to a prominent human rights watchdog calling for tougher international regulations on arms dealings .
the __quant1__ @-@ ton cache of ak47s was to have been secretly flown to __name2__ in __year1__ from a __name4__ base in __name3__ , but there is no proof that the __quant2__ plane loads of arms ever arrived , said __name1__ in a report released last week .
according to the report titled " dead on time , " private arms brokers working for the __name1__ clandestinely shipped hundreds of thousands of weapons and tens of millions of rounds of ammunition from __name3__ to __name2__ between __month1__ __year1__ and __month2__ __year2__ .
during those shipments , at least 200,000 __name1__ went missing after passing through the hands of private contractors from a half dozen countries .
&quot; the principal __name3__ contracting firm had to use a broker in __name4__ that was not known to the croatian government , &quot; said __name2__ 's arms control expert __name1__ .
" they then used a freight forwarding agent in __name1__ .
they contracted a cargo company that had broken the __name1__ embargo on __name2__ and also flew an aircraft out that did n't have air operating authorization ."
reached by telephone , officials at the __name1__ would not comment for this story .
according to the humanitarian group __name1__ , there are currently no global standards for governments ' regulation of arms exports and no international requirements for governments to link guns to their location--whether military stockpile , police depot , or civilian home .
this is an especially big problem , says __name1__ , because 12 billion bullets are produced every year--enough to kill everyone in the world __quant1__ .
they and other human rights groups have pinned some of their hopes for tougher regulations on a __name1__ summit scheduled to begin __month1__ __day1__ th in __name2__ .
__name1__ lobbyist greg puley told oneworld that the __year1__ __name2__ small arms review conference will help usher in a new level of agreement " on basic principles--such as you do n't sell weapons to people who will use them to commit human rights abuses or other atrocities ."
puley said the __name1__ union--along with a host of __name2__ , __name3__ , and __name4__ nations--have already endorsed this position .
the __name1__ government 's position is unknown .
the __name1__ administration , he said , " hasn't blocked progress ."
" it 's certainly in their interest , " puley added , " to stop people from selling arms to people who plan to use them for terrorist acts ."
there is nothing about making weapons illegal for civilians in this treaty because that is not the point of this one .
this one is just designed to make it easier to track down people 's weapons .
only after they get enough tools in place to track down all the guns will they start pushing treaties that make guns illegal for civilians .
oh ?
point to the part of the treaty that makes it easier to track down who owns guns ?
articles 7 and 8 ( which replicate the decentralized gun registration system that was set up here in __year1__ ) .
so you do n't want to enforce __name1__ laws then ?
the treaty does n't create anything not already in existence in __name1__ law .
laws concerning the illegal transfer of weapons hardly make it easier to track down weapons owned legally .
yes they do .
since the laws already exist in the __name1__ and have since __year1__ , your fear of losing your weapon has obviously been realized , right ? .
your fears have proven correct , have n't they ?
when did you lose your guns ?
or is __quant1__ years not long enough to get over your paranoia ?
more idiocy from the gun nuts that can n't seem to read simple __name1__ .
do n't be a bigot .
so , when did you lose your guns ?
there is nothing in the treaty that is not already __name1__ law .
yet you have n't lost your guns under __name1__ law .
when the treaty to take your guns away comes along then you can complain about treaties wanting to take your guns away .
until then you are acting paranoid and demanding we ignore __name1__ laws .
it seems you did n't bother to read the statement by bolton oralloy
the __name1__ goes to great lengths to ensure that small arms and light weapons transferred under our jurisdiction are done so with the utmost responsibility .
the transfer of all military articles of __name1__ origin are subject to extremely rigorous procedures under the __name2__ and __name3__ .
all __name2__ exports of defense articles and services , including small arms and light weapons , must be approved by the __name1__ .
assurances must be given by the importing country that arms will be used in a manner consistent with our criteria for arms exports : they must not contribute to regional instability , arms races , terrorism , proliferation , or violations of human rights .
arms of __name1__ origin cannot be retransferred without approval by the __name2__ .
to ensure that arms are delivered to legitimate end @-@ users , our government rigorously monitors arms transfers , investigating suspicious activity and acting quickly to curtail exports to those recipients who do not meet our strict criteria for responsible use .
in the past __quant2__ years , the __name1__ has conducted thousands of end @-@ use checks , interdicted thousands of illicit arms shipments at __name2__ ports of exit , and cut @-@ off exports entirely to __quant1__ countries due to their failure to properly manage u.s. origin defense articles .
all commercial exporters of arms in the __name1__ must be registered as brokers and submit each transaction for government licensing approval .
our brokering law is comprehensive , extending over citizens and foreign nationals in the __name1__ , and also __name2__ citizens operating abroad .
believing that it is in our interest to stem the illicit trade in military arms , the __name1__ has avidly promoted and supported such international activities as the __name2__ and the __name3__ register of conventional arms .
bilaterally , we offer our financial and technical assistance all over the world to mitigate the illicit trade in sa/lw . we have worked with countries to develop national legislation to regulate exports and imports of arms , and to better enforce their laws .
we have provided training , technical assistance , and funds to improve border security and curb arms smuggling in many areas of the world where this problem is rampant .
and in the past year , we have instituted a program to assist countries in conflict @-@ prone regions to secure or destroy excess and illicit stocks of small arms and light weapons .
it seems __name1__ ( and the __name2__ ) is against " illicit " trade just like the __name3__ treaty is .
that filthy commie , __name1__ !
somebody should shoot him !
great !
now these idiots will start to ramble on about how the __name1__ gov't .
is kaotaoing to the __name1__ , if not in the un pocket outright .
" proof ?
we do n't need no stinking proof !
we gots our paranoid delusions to keeps us warm ! "
that and their firearms ....
as long as you got your __name1__ , you 'll never be lonely .
pathetic and alarming , but never lonely .
i 'll say it once again : we need to have the military conduct airstrikes on these ngos .
they hate our freedom even more than __name1__ does .
a single napalm raid on __name1__ headquarters could save us a lot of grief in the long run .
it has been pointed out that the proposed treaty deals only with the illegal manufacture and distribution of firearms--in which case , your objections do n't seem to actually refer to the text of the proposed treaty .
as they build stronger and stronger measures to track down " illegal weapons " they 'll move into making treaties that start declaring more weapons illegal .
it has also been pointed out ( in particular , by me ) , that the consent of __quant1__ of the senate would be required to secure ratification of such a treaty .
do you apprehend that this would occur ?
the __name1__ does not have as strong a hold on the __name2__ as they do on the __name3__ .
however , the requirement for __quant1__ @/@ __quant1__ rds of the votes is comforting .
i 'd guess that the __name1__ could block most of it .
but my preference would be to not risk such a vote in the __value1__ place .
also , the __name1__ has a poor track record in standing up for full @-@ auto weapons , so their defense there might not be as solid as for other weapons .
the argument of the fanatics of the gun lobby is , whether overtly made , or inferentially , that they need weapons to protect themselves from the tyranny of the government , and that this was the intent of the __name1__ .
well , the primary motivation of the __name2__ was based on the premise that with a strong militia there would be no need for a standing __name1__ .
they had the notion that a militia could never be tyrannical , and a standing __name1__ would probably lead to tyranny .
however , there was a bit of a notion of the militia providing a last ditch defense against tyranny if it came to that .
in __year1__ , an appeal was made to the __name2__ by a representative of the __name1__ after an idictment was quashed against __quant1__ men for transporting a sawed @-@ off shotgun .
in the __name2__ versus miller , the __name1__ held :
in the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a ' shotgun having a barrel of less than __quant1__ inches in length ' at this time has some reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia , we cannot say that the __name1__ guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument .
certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense .
aymette v . state of __name1__ , 2 __name2__ . , tenn . , 154 , 158 .
this case can be read <a href="http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&court=us&vol=307&invol=174"> at __name1__ findlaw page . </a>
a good ruling .
i wish they 'd start enforcing it .
the __name1__ has never comprehensively reviewed the application of the iind __name2__ .
what about the above __name1__ ?
further , in the __name2__ versus miller , the __name1__ suggested that there might be a standard for determining what constitute the arms of the militia , although they did not delve further into what that might be .
i think they did far more than suggest it .
so far , case law with the __name1__ holds that states may regulate the militia and their arms , and prohibit armed bodies outside their regulatory code .
actually , i think it would be up to __name1__ to decide the arms , although the courts should be able to step in if congress chose something inappropriate .
quite apart from the appalling poor performance of militia in the history of the __name1__ , there is no good reason to believe that any state ever has or ever will allow citizens to arm themselves as they choose and associate in armed bodies at their own discretion .
however , hopefully we will someday return to the __name1__ and have the states actually set up militia under government control , which people could join if they wished to .
whatever may please oralloy has no bearing upon what regulation the states may enact , and whether or not the __name1__ will permit such regulation .
well on the supreme court thing , my statements are in line with the constitution , and the __name1__ has a fairly good track record of eventually returning to the __name2__ when they have departed from it , so there may come __quant1__ day when they will rule that way .
and until then we have the __name1__ to fight gun legislation in __name2__ .
it 's a dream , and a sick and dangerous dream at that .
i do n't see what is sick or dangerous about dreaming of having the __name1__ followed .
if the __name1__ decided a law was constitutional then how can it be unconstitutional ?
by violating the __name1__ .
the __name1__ does not get to rewrite the __name2__ .
if they make an illegitimate ruling in support of an unconstitutional law , the government will have free rein to violate the __name1__ until such time as the __name2__ reverses their ruling , but it does not change the fact that the __name1__ is being violated throughout this time .
" separate but equal " is a good example of this .
the __name1__ issued bogus rulings that allowed the government to do unconstitutional segregation for many years .
the fact that the __name2__ allowed it does not change the fact that it was a blatant violation of our __name1__ .
so , you do n't support enforcing the laws then oralloy .
you only support enforcing those you do n't disagree with , those laws you do n't think violate the __name1__ .
the legal rulings do n't matter .
only your personal opinion does .
a fool 's game that allows you to pretend to want to follow the law at the same time you are more than willing to ignore it .
i 'd hardly characterize " support for our __name1__ " as a fool 's game ....
the fool 's game is deciding solely on your own about what is constitutional without reference to the constitutional manner in how constitutionality is decided .
@izzythepush ,
it is quite shocking that u 'd think that __name1__ · wanted to inflict the horrors of the __name2__ on the __name3__ .
we were innocent of that .
david
alright david perhaps i am being a bit too extreme .
being extreme is ok if u r accurate , in bearing close fidelity · to what actually happened .
your accusation against us is purely imaginary , · with no trace of a basis in fact .
it 's all a question of where you 're sitting .
its not ; its a question of being factually accurate in your assertions .
i do n't honestly believe that the ordinary __name1__ in __year1__ wanted to do such a thing .
i never heard of extraordinary __name1__ desiring that the __name2__ apocalypse fall on __name3__ .
we were at peace since __year1__ .
__name1__ and __name2__ have been enemies since __year1__ .
u know that __name1__ had good and logical claims on the throne , by heredity .
during the __name4__ __name1__ , ( not just __name2__ , it was after the __name3__ ) faced __quant1__ of the biggest threats of invasion ever .
we had witnessed what the revolutionaries had done to their own people .
what would they have done to the old enemy ?
i see ; u had __name1__ in mind .
i get a bit fed up with all the __name1__ bashing whenever the __name2__ is mentioned .
you seem to hold the __name1__ as some sort of group of saints , which is fine .
agreed !
you then expect everyone else to blindly accept that .
no ; thay were good for us , not for u .
we also have to take the part of the black hearted villain with good grace .
__name1__ is vilified as some sort of geogian __name2__ , but in terms of monarchs he was n't that bad .
he was a big admirer of __name1__ .
he was very interested in modern agriculture , was concerned about the common man and lived a rather modest lifestyle , for a monarch .
compare him with his son to see a figure more befitting of the title __name1__ .
your __name1__ were not wholly altruistic saints .
__name1__ stands for personal freedom & individualism , not for altruism .
a lot of them did very well out of the __name1__ .
good thing ! !!
__name1__ became the __value1__ __name2__ millionaire .
i 'm not saying the __name1__ was n't a bad thing .
__name1__ is by and large a wonderful country , but it was founded by men with their own vices , not saints .
i also do n't think that i should get down on my knees and thank every __name1__ for their wartime contribution .
will u not be kneeling qua the __name1__ , or the __name2__ ? ?
__name1__ and __name2__ could not have won the war alone , but to hear some __name3__ talk you 'd think america did it all single handed .
not only that but we get __name1__ blockbusters telling blatant lies .
__name1__ , and more recently __name2__ were two wonderful wartime series which acurately showed the wartime experience and contribution of __name3__ troops .
not to mention the outstanding bravery .
it grieves me that __name1__ acquiesced so much to __name2__ .
bad news .
__name1__ was too much of a diplomat and not enuf of a soldier .
other films are not nearly so truthful .
i 'm not talking about films like __name1__ , which everyone knows is a load of nonsense , but films like __name2__ @-@ __name2__ which portrays itself as being historically accurate , but is a complete lie .
1 ) __name1__ crew are presented as evil murdering nazis , whereas most of them were quite decent .
i do n't think any __name1__ crew were prosecuted for war crimes .
2 ) an __name1__ ship captures the __name2__ machine .
the __name2__ machine was captured by __name1__ before __name3__ entered the war .
not only that the __name2__ codebreaking operation was an almost entirely __name1__ affair , run from __name3__ .
most analysts say it shortened the war by about __quant1__ years , but we do n't go on about that .
( i know i did go on about it then but it 's just once ) .
having said that , i 'm sorry if i 've offended you and setanta .
i do think __name1__ is a wonderful country with lots of lovely people .
nuff said .
@thomas ,
and not to forget the __name1__ @-@ __name2__ colonists .
leaving out __name1__ and __name2__ colonists in what is now the __name3__ seems to be quite common ...
@izzythepush ,
alright , __name1__ happened during the __name2__ .
__name1__ was n't really neutral , it was a major ally of the enemy .
things happen in wartime .
pressganging was something else that happened during war .
it ended in __year1__ .
that 's a good thing !
u better not try it now .
david
@izzythepush ,
our troops were fighting __name1__ in __name2__ and __name3__ .
maybe our interpretation of history does not reflect the __name1__ view .
then again you all seem to be more concerned with patting yourselves on the back than anything else .
izzie gets the a2k award for projection for this one !!
__name2__ is not under threat of invasion from __name1__ .
that does not mean that the __name1__ would not stop a __name2__ cargo ship en route to __name3__ .
is that hubris as well ?
__name1__ in __year1__ was not a threat to the __name2__ , while nuclear armed __name3__ is today a threat to both the __name4__ and the __name5__ .
@thomas ,
the religious @-@ persecution story is overhyped by pious schoolbook editors .
this can n't be emphasized too much .
it 's also a part of the " __name2__ @-@ centric " __name1__ mythic history .
@izzythepush ,
what the hell qualifies as a " major ally " for you ?
there were no __name1__ ships supporting the franco @-@ __name3__ fleets , there were no american troops fighting with __name4__ , __name1__ merchants were n't shipping war materials to __name2__ .
your paranoia is truly amazing--and completely unjustified .
i 'm frankly not surprised you feel the need to insult me .
the nation state is humanities most effective form of societal organization .
it is what has allowed the __name1__ to become so powerful , and so prosperous .
as a citizen you have signed an implicit contract with the nation state .
you are , in effect , its partner , and a partner with every other citizen .
your safety , you livelihood , and your freedom to act are all dependent upon the stability and success of the state in which you reside .
if your state happens to be successful , that is , if it happens to grant you a safe living environment , support against life 's ills , and the right to express yourself , then of course you should feel a connection to it .
you should desire that it remains powerful enough to continue providing these luxuries which do not exist elsewhere , you should desire that it becomes even better , and you should take pride in it .
pride , patriotism , nationalism , whatever you want to call it , is what built the __name1__ state .
like it or not .
if nobody cared about what happened to __name1__ , then __name1__ would n't exist .
you 're kidding , right ?
where did i insult you ?
and you think i " signed an implicit contract " what the hell are you smoking ?
so , whilst swimming in the womb , some god of __name1__ floated down to join me , handed me a pen and paper and said " you can be born here , but only if you agree to our rules "?
i did not choose to be born in this country .
i owe this country nothing .
frankly , i find your attitude sickening .
pride , patriotism and nationalism are holding the species back .
only when they are defeated ( and they will be ) can we truly fulfil our potential .
you claim the __name1__ army is useless , provide no evidence to back up your claim , and that attack me for not being knowledgeable .
ok ...
ok , ...
let 's put it into context .
in __year1__ , __name1__ was ruled by the military from what i remember .
they sent their best forces and got annihilated .
today , an overestimated __name1__ military expenditure is about __quant1__ dollars .
an underestimate of __name1__ expenditure is about __quant1__ dollars .
so , they really have no chance .
i am not going to waste any more time on the issue on imaginary scenarios of __name1__ espionage when they do not even have a military budget to defend their own country .
no , we should n't .
but there 's no need to react militarily to the problem , when the __name1__ won't be able to keep up that activity for long in the __value1__ place .
we can send extra forces to the garrison , send an extra frigate down there , schedule some training for another battalion , perhaps even send a high profile member of the royal family down there [ hmm .......
] and gently remind __name1__ what they already know : that they can n't do anything other than shout .
the __name1__ people know full well that we can n't afford endless operations , but that our armed forces have the strength required to resist any attack .
the rest of the world could n't care less .
__name1__ is without an aircraft carrier for the __value1__ time , and is downsizing significantly its armed forces .
the message __name1__ sends to the rest of the world when it responds with diplomatic " complaints " to blockades and embassy sackings is one of weakness .
the __name1__ , if they are as capable as you say they are , should send ships to end the blockade .
you did n't choose to , your parents , grandparents , on ancestors did when they helped to found @/@ moved to this country .
since you cannot consent until the age of __quant1__ , your parents , being your guardians , are the ones who decided for you to have __name1__ citizenship by having a child here .
if you wish to renounce your parents decision , and hence your citizenship , you are free to do so .
i get the sense you won't , though , because even though you claim this country owes you nothing , we both know that is n't true .
you were raised in a safe , prosperous , liberal environment that most of the world would be lucky to call home .
for you to pretend that such a privilege is worthless is an insult to the majority of humanity who cannot call a place like __name1__ home .
what proportion of that __quant1__ dollars do you think is spent on the __name1__ ?
sorry i dont understand your point relating to __name1__ and __name2__ ?
yes , whilst that is true what im saying is the chances of it happening in the near future arent high at all .
it is clear the government are in no mood to let these people populate the __name1__ and with __name3__ being one of the most important military instilations at the americans disposal , especially now that __name4__ has began to tick them off the chances of __name2__ moving out on the renewal date are next to nill .
for fear of sounding callous , wasnt that their choice to move here ?
where despite them complaining about having to put up with the rubbish english climate it is undeniable they have a far better quality of life than either __name1__ or __name2__ could offer them .
please you cannot possibly compare the two ?
and besides the americans have plenty of air bases in mainland __name1__ why would they want __quant1__ up in the __name2__
the base doesnt just provide the americans with a handy little tick on their tally sheet for military instillations it serves as a vital instilation for forward projection power across the globe , its been used for __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ and countless other missions have taken off from there .
my point is that whilst it is of course very sad the islanders were removed would the benefits to millions [ hear me out here ] that having the base their not out weigh them ?
one could argue that without having bases like this around the globe the americans ability to topple dictators as part of __name1__ for the good of these countries would have been severely effected .
fair enough , i could n't think of a decent island , so i just used __name1__ as a lame example .
my point about __name1__ and __name2__ is that together they will be overtaking the __name3__ in terms of military spending by __year1__ .
and if things go as i feel they will , the global south will start to dominate the north , whilst the __name1__ will lose a lot of what it currently has , i have a feeling that the rise of more superpowers and __name2__ 's heavy population in __name3__ will mean that it is unlikely that the __name4__ will be able to maintain a military base so close to mauritius .
( __name1__ effectively ' belongs ' to __name2__ , it 's heavily influenced by them would probably be the best way to put it ) .
so the chances in the short @-@ term are yes , very unlikely , but what 's the point in campaigning for anything if they 're not achievable in the long run ?
you talk about dictators etc. you 're telling me that by not using some other base in __name2__ for example , __name1__ could n't have achieved those aims ?
i highly doubt it , there is no need to remove an entire population for self @-@ gain .
while you 're there op , make sure you campaign for every territory on __name1__ which has been populated by force to be returned to there original inhabitants .
you know being fair and all .
they were forcibly expelled from __name1__ so the __name2__ could sell off the land to the __name3__ so they could build a torture centre @/@ military base there .
of course they have the right to return .

it 's short but if you do n't want to read it basically a guy in the __name1__ has been arrested for agreeing to meet up with and have sex with a " __quant1__ year old girl " who was actually an undercover cop ...
surely this is entrapment ?
he did n't actually do anything because they basically lead him into the situation ?
sure , it would be a crime if he had actually done this with a __quant1__ year old and something had happened when they met up ...
but the __name1__ police have basically created this whole scenario and lead him into it , feeding him along ?
he was arrested after agreeing to meet with her __month1__ __day1__ .
this suggests to me that the police officer was the one who suggested everything ...
coaxed him into it ...
we do n't know the full story but i get the impression that this " __quant1__ year old girl " offered him sex on a plate willingly ....
would that be legal in this country ?
i mean i think it 's wrong that this guy would meet up with a __quant1__ year old with the intent to have sex ...
but fabricating the situation ...
you can n't arrest someone for something they have n't done ...
it 's just wrong ...
am i the only one who thinks this is messed up ?
if she suggested it his defence will destroy the case
from previous similar stories , what usually happens is that the undercover officer behind the screen is extremely passive ( as a normal young innocent teenager would probably be ) and then agrees to meet up with the potential paedophile , if he shows up at the place then he is guilty .
i see nothing wrong with this morally , he knows the girl is __quant1__ and still decides to meet her ( having previously stated his intentions through __name1__ ) .
you 've never seen __name1__ ?
please , take a seat ...
if that is the case then i understand and agree , it 's just the way the article is written it sounds as if the police officer is doing a lot of the work , and it 's in __name1__ so different laws to here .
they do this and it works , there is even a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/to_catch_a_predator"> show </a> about it .
to me its fine , if the suspect has to make a choice , ie leave his home and go to a location , then i do n't really care if he is encouraged .
__quant1__ is illegal , same as __quant2__ , both are morally wrong and disgusting .
if he agreed to do it under the illusion it was a real __quant1__ year old , how do we know he has n't already done it before , or would n't in the future , he must have been looking to have stumbled across the __quant2__ yr old police woman .
i think its a good thing
yeah its totally a good thing that police are allowed to trick people to get convictions
he agreed to meet with a __quant1__ year old for sex , and your on his side ?
he should be arrested , if he knew she was __quant1__ ( like some have said , she could have sent older @-@ looking pics and lied about her age ) .
i do n't think the police are wrong for the method they used .
why wait for __quant1__ year olds to be raped or w.e before arresting people ?
surely it 's better to be safe than sorry on serious matters like this ?
paedophile or not , arranging to meet with a __quant1__ year old for sex is ****ing wrong and he knows it , so he should rightly be punished .
anyone that disagrees needs their head testing , or locking up !
lol ok , this is starting to sound like a dictatorship..
tricking people into " comitting crimes " and locking away anyone who disagrees .
he is not a paedophile because she is n't pre pubescent ...
i 'm not saying it is n't wrong i 'm saying paedophilia is a strong word and not the right one to use .
not this debate again
can we not accept that " paedophile " is used as a sort of umbrella term
anyone else confused as to how a __quant1__ year old became an undercover cop in the __value1__ place ?
you utter buffoon @/@ comic genius !
so the end justifies the means ?
i 'm not disagreeing that it is wrong , but i do n't think coaxing someone into doing something they might not otherwise do , which is the impression that the article give , is a good way about catching " criminals "...
maybe my interpretation of the article is wrong or maybe the author is n't very clear ...
but i do n't think it 's right that you can basically reel someone in to potentially comitting a crime ( he did not sleep with a __quant1__ year old ) then arrest them on that basis .
not sure if someone 's already mentioned this , but a tv programme called " __name1__ " did this - __name2__ basically set up stings and then publicly filmed them when he revealed himself to them .
not sure if they lead to arrests , i think they did
i 'm baffled at how you can be on his side .
he has the intention of sleeping with a minor , which is not only illegal but immoral .
if the police arrest a man with detailed plans for blowing up a building in a city , with all the equipment for making a bomb , but he has n't actually made it yet , would you be on this man 's side too ?
i think not , i think you 'd be glad they intervened and took __quant1__ potential bomber off the streets , much like they 've took __quant2__ potential child rapist of the streets here .
there 's a significant difference here - the paedophile caught would have been looking on forums and the like for young girls .
it 's not like the girl turned up on his doorstep , stripped and then they arrested him .
the man was ****ing __quant1__ years old
good
people have their preferences .
many centuries ago , so @-@ called " paedophilia " would not even have been frowned upon .
you must know morality is relativity , right ?
__quant1__ mean many centuries ago , if you were known for killing ferocious men in foreign lands , you were praised by your people for valiant behaviour , bravery etc.
but the fact he agreed shows he has it within him to do that .
just because a ' __quant1__ year old girl ' offers sex is every man going to accept that , no.
one less paedophile on the streets .
but is a guy who 's willing to have sex with a __quant1__ year old girl therefore definitely a paedophile though ?
in many countries that 'd be completely legal
i think this is more widely allowed and used in the __name1__ than here .
i suppose if they wanted to have a really good case against him , they would have to be extremely passive and let him do most of the work .
personally i do n't see anything wrong with it - he was gonna do it .
they may have just prevented a child from being raped
i 'm not sure its entrapment really .
entrapment is where the person has no other choice than to comply .
eg busting an undercover cop for buying drugs or a civilian for buying drugs under threats of violence .
why are people defending him ? !
the fact that he even agreed is sooo messed up !
so maybe the punishment is harsh because he did n't really ' do ' anything , but still , even the thought of chatting to her is wrong !
stop cutting him slack .
because it 's been established that this form of attraction , is in fact quite normal in some cases and not necessarily perverted .
- they should have chosen a much younger police officer , __name1__ howsers younger sister perhaps .
we are not necessarily defending this particular individual - just saying it 's possible for there to be a very normal attraction between a man and some young girls - if she reciprocates then it should be between them .
unfortunately for better or worse some humans have grown so smart they are able to find fault with normal programming and improve on nature .
if instead of age we used cup and frontal cortex size it might be fairer system .
no that 's not true , there does not have to be threats etc. nor does the defendant have to have no other choice ...
well then youve obviously been brought up to hate the monarchy and you need to re @-@ assess your views .
indeed , the monarchy is technically theocratic but thats it has evolved over the centuries - it used to be an absolute monarchy and is now just a constitutional one , we can keep our traditions as long as they evolve to meet the needs of the current generation .
an atheist monarch will come along sooner or later it doesnt require scrapping of the whole institution .
and we dont need her but as i said , she is a source of national pride , distinctiveness , a symbol of our heritage and brings in tourism revenue .
and lastly..
the queen is the best person for the job .
the queen making a visit to the republic was a big deal , there were some protests from hardliner irish republicans , and general apathy from the rest of the population .
but the irish were bowled over when queen came over and paid her respects to irishmen who fought for __name3__ and those who fought for independence from britain , to her bowing in honour of the victims of the __value1__ __name1__ to even ex @-@ __name2__ members .
most people in __name1__ and __name2__ agreed her laying the wreath and paying her respects was a great moment in anglo @-@ irish relations - a lot of irish people said it drew a line under things .
now imagine if an elected nobody , perhaps even if __name1__ took on the role of president as well as prime minister , would anyone cared or even have noticed if cameron went to __name2__ to lay down a wreath ?
would the irish have considered __name1__ coming over to lay a wreath it a big step foward in irish @-@ english reconcilliation ?
no
the queen is the best abassador this country could ever have .
she is in a symbolic role and no one has more symbolic pull than her given her familys history - traced back from __name1__ conquer .
have i convinced you yet ?
no you have n't convinced me , that is __quant1__ act which i agree is good , but does not mean that it is the reason why we should keep a monarchy .
i havent been brought up with any views my family are also divided over the monarchy , i have just looked at the situation from a neutral point of view and come to the view that we do not need a monarchy .
also i would n't advise it be best to have __name1__ filling both roles , we need __quant1__ different people for each role .
yes it is a big part of out history and i am proud of our history and the importance of what they did , and i think the monarchy did a goodish job in the previous centuries , but now in the modern world , we do not need them .
shows how prompt medical checkups @/@ care can keep you going for so long .
well if tsr found out your mother was seriously ill ( not wishing bad health on her ) you wouldnt expect me to say " frankly there are so many people far more ill than her , just because she happens to be the parent of someone on tsr she does n't deserve any more care than any other person "
hes the husband of our head of state .
try and dissasociate yourself with them as much as possible , youre from __name1__ so maybe its the __name2__ syndrome ...
a close member of my family is in fact in hospital over __name1__ , but i do n't request the sympathy of the nation , so your comparison does n't work .
to me , __name1__ just happens to be the husband of some woman i neither know nor esteem , because all she did was..
be born to a privileged family .
i wish him well just as i would any other stranger 's husband .
as for your __name1__ quip , i do n't even know what stereotype you 're working towards , but i can assure you i do not fit it , and it shows the weakness of your argument if you feel you have to make judgmental comments about my region on the country to back yourself up .
so because we dont need them is enough of a reason to scrap a tradition which many people in this country have a great affection for and affinity to ?
there are other reasons too , but the main ones is that we dont need them , it also is undemocratic and on a personal note , as an aethiest i cannot agree with anyone appointed into a postion such as the head of state by __name1__ as i do not believe he is real .
he is such a chrachter , i hope he pulls through
please do not attempt your half @-@ witted slang language , as you fail at it fantastically .

it 's not slang my dear , it 's something known as a meme .
memes are created from slang
__value1__ href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_meme"> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/internet_meme </a>
educate yourself .
one day you 'll get the slang correct and you 'll fit in with the cool kids , just keep telling yourself this .
__value1__ href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dphjukqowz0"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dphjukqowz0 </a>
aww babe , you 're only embarrassing yourself
you embarrassed yourself by saying ' you mad bro '.
i can imagine you saying it in a posh accent as well .
but i guess you 're only trying to fit in with your other __name1__ pals .
i understand , but i 'm talking more about the __name1__ types and the types who are ideologically like but are n't publicity whores .
it 's one thing now that they 're just about __quant1__ or so , but imagine in __quant2__ years time , when they 've raised kids and made proselytes to their wahhabist creed , both among the __name1__ community and the prisoners @/@ social outcaste non @-@ __name1__ who they target ; they could well be 50,000 or more .
this seems to be what the __name1__ means to target , but the fact that many of them really do n't know much more about __name2__ demographics and sects aside from what comes off of bare naked islam.com and they do n't seem to be the most intellectually astute bunch .
as for the other ethnic minorities , i saw some __name1__ videos of __name2__ divisions in __name3__ protecting their community during the riots over the summer , and from what i understand most of the rioters where black .
also , the __name1__ has a __name2__ division , __name3__ division and they had a nice article on their website about __name5__ __name4__ : <a __value1__ http://englishdefenceleague.org/tag/ahmadiyya-muslim/ </a>
ah right , will read that .
really ?
why do you reckon they dont get as much coverage ?
they 've most likely done something wrong which equates to what we see in the media nowadays about __name1__ ?
well , on the surface they go about it in a civilised manner , if you google some documentaries on them you 'll be able to see that they did n't start out that way !
still , they will never hold enough seats in __name1__ anyways .
hmmm no not really .
even with all the anti @- __name1__ propaganda , the majority of people do see through their so @- called " party " to the fact that they 're a bunch of idiots .
you can see from their supporters that the people who support them are as stupid as they are .
they 're not even " anti @- extremism " they 're just racists .
tbh i honestly think the whole __name1__ terrorist thing will just fade out in the future .
it 's just another scapegoat theme @- we 've had the __name1__ and blacks in the past , now __name2__ , in the next __quant1__ years everyone might be hating on scientologists or something .
but what i think is really important is that people do n't rise to the taunts , and do n't lower themselves to the other persons level .
the only way to fight racism is to be a good example and change people 's perceptions
i agree with you .
appriciate your feedback and yeah i hope so too !
cheers !
no i did n't
and the majority of __name1__ members probably don ; t use internet memes , as it implies a certain level of nerdieness
this genuinely makes me sad .
racism is a belief or doctrine that inherent differences among the various human races determine cultural or individual achievement , usually involving the idea that one 's own race is superior and has the right to rule others .
this is evident in all groups , cultures and races throughout the globe .
to state that racism is in white peoples blood is to effectively ignore the atrocities committed by virtually every other race in the world .
what about __name1__ and the __name2__ and the __name3__ ?
__name1__ and the purges ?
__name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ ?
just because a crime , based on discrimination , is committed against someone who may have a similar skin tone does that make it less despicable ?
discrimination is essentially an evolutionary throwback , and everyone will be guilty of it to some extent in their lives .
__name1__ and the __name2__ system , class discrimination in the __name3__ and inter @-@ group discrimination are but a few examples .
instead of focusing on the perceived differences between races try and find the root of your anger .
by stating that ' white ' people are inherently different to ' black ' people you are indeed succumbing to racism , which to all intents and purposes , is hypocritical .
as for the __name1__ and the __name2__ these are in my opinion minority groups born out of ignorance and swelled by frustration .
the __name1__ are indeed violent and their popularity helped by media images of __name2__ fundamentalists protesting against soldiers returning from service in __name3__ and __name4__ , which in a country with a strong military history and history of pride in the __name5__ was bound to inflame a disenchanted , unemployed and in many instances poorly educated youth .
which , essentially , is what the __name1__ are .
the __name1__ are a far more dangerous organisation .
insidious in their operations and now validated by acknowledgement by the __name1__ and political system they are a threat to this country and the very values that __name2__ should be proud of .
for we are indeed the most multi @-@ cultural and forward thinking nation in __name1__ .
dont believe me ?
the burkha ban in __name1__ ?
__decade1__ 's __name1__ style racism in __name2__ and __name3__ ?
so , regarding these occurances , do you think __name1__ will ever make a mark in history ?
because , even though they 're portrayed by the media in such a negative manner , they still stand firmly .
now the true members of __name1__ are shown .
spoiler : · stevee
piss off
missed an ' e '.
and your point is ?
i am more than happy to defend the __name1__ , you mad bro ?
the __name1__ are not however , violent today , to the best of my knowledge , and that is what judgement of them as a political party should be based on .
not their transition from __name1__ to __name2__ in the early 90 's .
yes , they have a rather sordid past , but at some point you have to judge on current merits , not __quant1__ old acts .
besides , there is enough to make the __name1__ a joke now , without trying to resort to alleged links to __name2__ @-@ __name2__ and that sort of thing .
" __name1__ members have low intellectual capacity ! !1111 " clearly you set high standards for intellect mr portsmouth uni
please stick to the topic .
argue with eachother about memes and slang via inbox please .
i refuse to accept someone is this uneducated .
what evidence do you have that counters his statement ?
false claims mean nothing .
no i did n't
are you telling me i was right in saying that you are part of the __name1__ ?
if so , that is disgustingly disgusting tbh . · also , it 's difficult to be an __name1__ nerd , as those who are intelligent know perfectly well that their beliefs are not thought out very well .
because the rape of non @-@ muslims is so funny , right ?
and the rape of __name1__ , is ?
i refuse to find anyone with a low @-@ self esteem unattractive despite how nice their body may seem .
a darn sight more intellectual than you i do n't doubt .
and a messed up as @-@ __name1__ year does n't really mean i lack intellectual capacity , however , your judgement as such cast aspertions on yours
yar steevo bohot bara gandu hai
this is a meme .
it is not gangster related .
" i refuse to find anyone with a low @-@ self esteem unattractive " · strong double negative .
ultimately you are bat-**** insane , so this is all irrelevant .
u mad ?
yeh u mad .
man i wish i did n't have to choose between __name1__ and cambridge..
idgi .
give me another example , if you may .
maybe this conversation posted by " libertarian " in another thread will put things into perspective :
a conversation with a liberal ...
something rather strange happened last night .
firstly , i was in a pub , which is in itself unusual .
secondly , i found myself in conversation with some rather earnest liberal types .
the conversation turned to politics , which led eventually to a rather silly looking woman ( rslw ) saying that she hated the __name1__ .
voice of reason ( vor ) : really why is that ?
rslw : because they are horrible , __name1__ skin head brutes .
vor : i see , and what is your opinion of __name1__ fundamentalists ?
do you hate them too ?
rslw : no , why would i hate them ?
vor : you do n't think of them as horrible , __name1__ brutes ?
rslw : no , certainly not .
what are you trying to say ?
are you a racist ?
vor : how many foreign people have the __name1__ murdered in the name of the __name1__ ?
but i am aware of the __quant1__ people murdered in the name of __name1__ in __name2__ in __year1__ , and the __quant2__ murdered in the name of __name1__ in __name3__ on __name4__ @/@ __name4__ , and over 1,000,000 murdered in the name of __name1__ in the __name5__ .
historically there has been hundreds of millions murdered in the name of islam across the world , every year there are hundreds of thousands murdered in the name of __name1__ .
are you prepared to admit therefore that __name1__ is a murderous religion ?
rslw : no , __name1__ is a religion of peace .
vor : but the __name1__ is a violent sect ?
filled with murderous racists ?
even though you cannot name a single murder carried out in their name ?
rslw : yes , that 's right , even if they do n't murder people , we all know they would like too .
vor : would you say that the __name1__ , whatever you think about them .
believe that their country is under threat ?
rslw : no , they are a bunch of thugs , looking for an excuse to hate .
vor : would you say that the fundamentalist muslims , who murder your fellow countymen in the name of __name1__ , were intent on eventually taking control of your country and running it as an islamic state ?
rslw : what ! !
oh my god , you really are a racist are n't you ?
vor : but is it not a act that the __name1__ claim that they are acting in self defence of your country ; and is it not a fact that the fundamentalist __name2__ claim they want to take over your country ?
rslw : look , you are trying to put words into my mouth , you are obviously a racist who ...
vor : sorry to interupt you , but i just want to get something straight here .
on one hand we have followers of a religion called __name1__ , who murder us in the name of that religion and inform us that their ultimate ambition is to conquer us , whilst on the other hand we have a group of people who have murdered no one , and who wish to defend the country , yet you think that the __name2__ is filled with murderous haters and that __name1__ is a religion of peace ?
rslw : yes , absolutely .
only a racist would think otherwise .
vor : have you read __name2__ 's __name1__ ?
rslw : off course i have ! !
i have a __value1__ class degree in english literature from the __name1__ !
vor : how admirable .
a veritable achievement indeed .
one assumes therefore you are familiar with the __quant1__ __name1__ , carried out by __name2__ state propagandists , aimed at rousing the passionate hatred of the populace against __name3__ ?
rslw : yes !
absolutely !
overt propaganda utilised as a means of empowering the state at the expense of the common man in the street !
margaret thatcher ....
vor : my dear , you must excuse me interupting again , but do you not think that yourself might be a victim of state propaganda and brainwashing techniques ?
rslw : me ?
absolutely not ! !
i just happen to be a senior advertising account executive ; there is little i do not know about propagandist techniques .
vor : fascinating , but is it not a fact that the __name1__ state via the media , relentlessly portrays __name2__ as a religion of peace and the __name3__ as a party of violent racists ?
rslw : yes , but ....
vor : you say you are not a victim of state propaganda , yet you defend islam as a religion of peace , even whilst you admit they commit mass murder in the name of their religion and have a stated ambition of taking over your country ; yet you denounce the __name1__ , who you admit have murdered no one , and act only in the defence of your country , as murderous racist thugs ?
rslw : you are deliberately confusing me , and you are deliberately putting words in my mouth again , i ....
vor : my dear lady , i fear the confusion resides with you .
whilst it has been more enlightening talking to you , i regret that i must now go away .
alternative hostelries within the near vicinity beckon , with an even sense of urgency .
vor : exits stage left .
the earnest liberals continue drinking half pints of fizzy beer and small measures of cuvee __name1__ brut - all of then uniformly appalled that such an ignorant and racist individual had so recently been within their fragrant and enlightened midst .
wow that vor person is a idiot !
if you support the __name1__ or __name2__ you 're missing a few braincells .
such people are n't capable of rational thought and only understand violence .
they 're all a bunch of uneducated , delinquent and ignorant bigots who blame the countries problems on foreigners .
i 'd rather have a hard working immigrant who goes to work at __time1__ am and comes back at 5 pm to his family then a chav scumbag who sits on his arse all day spending our money on drugs and alcohol and playing his loud music all night long .
i speak only of the __name1__ not the edl .
your argument seems to be missing a few brain cells as it does not seem to be formed of rational thought , only prejudice .
maybe you would like to explain why the __name1__ is not capable of rational thought .
do you know what the __name1__ 's policies even are ?
have you read their manifesto ?
taylor gang wrote " i 'd rather have a hard working immigrant who goes to work at __time1__ am and comes back at 5 pm to his family then a chav scumbag who sits on his arse all day spending our money "
i see so , rather than get the __name1__ chav people back to work and develop __name1__ manufacturing so we a . solve our balance of payments/ debt problems and and stop making __name2__ current account deficits year after year and b . solve social problems by turning the welfare hellholes with drug dealing , knife & drug crime back into productive places where people have jobs ( which they __quant1__ were before cultural marxism introduced benefits currently at £2,000 per month ) , instead of importing labour so the state pays for a brit to do nothing , and subsidises a foreigner who is low paid .
you do n't want to tackle this problem then , do just want to keep perpetuating it then ?
and is that supposed to be rational ?
i put it to you that you sir , with your attitude are part of __name1__ 's decline .
you dont understand his post .
do you think incorporating the __name1__ 's policies will make the ' chav ' work ?
no.
the ' chav ' isnt bothered now , and wont be bothered when theres no immigrants around , just a slight change in scenery .
there is work around ; just jobs that people arent prepared to take since claiming benefits is easier than sweeping streets or cleaning dishes .
if they did take up these jobs , they wouldnt have such a bad reputation .
taylorgang wrote " these chavs are counter @-@ productive .
it would be impossible to regenerate them into civilised citizens again .
the have no work ethic , no morales or values .
where i live the council funded a local project to regenerate old houses in a certain housing estate in the town , within a month these new houses were literally destroyed by the same people that lived in them .
what civilised human being would do that to their own home ? ....
the __name1__ people are responsible for britian 's decline . "
i agree with your observations and understand why you feel the way you do , however i do n't think that there is such a thing as " beyond saving ".
there is perhaps a lost generation in a section of society , but that is not to say that a future generation cannot be saved .
there needs to be a strong right wing effort to save these people .
there needs to be tough love , what some people would call __name1__ because extreme measures would need to be taken .
for example one thing i proposed to __name3__ was __name1__ , i.e. taking away benefits and giving them the option to work assembling goods for reebok , nike or dell , and this would be subsidised by the state for the benefit of reviving __name2__ ’s manufacturing industry and improving the trade deficits/ debt situation .
or one could just remove benefits and encourage high quality high specification manufacturing ( like __name1__ engine dept.) .
there have been too many carrots for doing nothing and no sticks for doing something bad .
as soon as this landscape changes , people will react because human beings will do what they need to do to survive .
but it will take politicians with some gumption to change this , and the current lot have no gumption , and the brainwashed __name1__ do n't want this because for ideological reasons they regard welfare hellholes with drugs and crime as " progress " ( all they can do is say what they are anti and " no passar " but they have no solutions , and they cannot even debate sensibly without degerating a dicussion into a circus with sware words , labels and symbols .)
we need a __name1__ vision and we need people with conviction to stand by it , not scared politicians pandering to " political correctness " like we have now .
every country in the world needs immigrants to function .
__name1__ was evolved from immigrants and is one of the most superior countries in the world .
my opinion is that the __name1__ have no place in our society and i will always stick with that opinion no matter what .
i dont know if you 're trolling or not ?
but , what makes you think __name1__ try to convert the people around them ?
lets be honest , the majority of the __name1__ are pretty closed @-@ minded .
they 're not trying to get rid of all other ethnicities to make this country composed of just britons ; but muslims , because __name1__ are now portrayed as malicous beings that caused the __name2__ @/@ __name2__ .
before bombings , __name4__ @/@ __name4__ , etc. __name1__ and __name2__ did not exist or atleast were not active and __name3__ were not targeted by such parties as such .
mass media has caused much of the commotion .
however , __name1__ 's common members lack the intellect to be able to comprehend this .
want evidence ?
check out the __name2__ 's __name1__ page and their forums and observe the ignorance some of the members display in response to some situations .
it 's pathetic .
sorry i meant it 's far from the best way of going about it .
__name1__ appear to have been started by people who ( rightly ) did n't want to be taken over in their own towns and have them converted to __name2__ .
why should they ?
why should they be __value1__ class citizens ?
violent people siding with them , the media and people on here give them a bad name i suppose .
no one 's being forced to convert to __name1__ .
that 's against __name1__ in itself .
tell me how they are __value1__ class citizens ?
also , here 's something where their leader called " every single __name1__ " responsible for __name2__ @/@ __name2__ .
really , even those that died as a result ?
__value1__ href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqtdg-7zupq"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqtdg-7zupq </a>
as i said , it 's the wrong way to go about it but it 'd proof not everybody wants the whole multiculturalism lark .
that 's all .
hooligans in disguise , but atleast it 's amusing when they hype up marches expecting __quant1__ people then __quant2__ turn up , so they end up provoking people and then run away on coaches
there was a protest outside the __name3__ __name2__ who were trialling so called " halal " meat and __name1__ were protesting outside .
although the food was n't really halal because it was stunned first this still made me laugh .
a comment on their __name1__ page reads .
tonight the turn out at the __name1__ was pathetic !
all the so @-@ called members of the __name1__ division and we have __quant1__ stood up there !
we need to sort this out !

article made me laugh .
wow , your one to talk .
mentally ill ?
im surprised you remember to breath never mind hold a political veiw point ffs . · people like you should be locked up in an asylum fit the safety of others ffs .
i know that you like __name1__ to hold political prisoners but , well thank god it is the thug/ violent __name3__ not the gentlemen __name4__ members that are locked up and in the dock from the demo in __name2__ this weekend .
“ anti @-@ __name1__ ” my *****.
that is rediculous .
i facepalmed after i read that .
such a waste of time .
the __name1__ are n't racist , they have __name2__ and minority members .
they oppose islamification of a largely secular country .
racism is putting down other races ; __name1__ has nothing to do with that .
we do n't want mosques everywhere in this country ...
fair play on the __name1__ .
__name1__ + __name2__ - why = __name1__ ?
the rise of a far right party whose solution to this balkan situation would be reminiscent of __year1__ @-@ __year2__ again .
do you think the world will let that happen ?
the last __name1__ massacre i remember was in __name2__ and the world intervened to stop it , where the perpetrators behind it now face international court
then why did __name1__ threaten " every single __name2__ "?
also , i thought the __name1__ wants freedom and democracy ?
if they really want freedom and democracy , then they should recognise that as part of democracy , you get freedom of religion and from religion ie : you do n't have to belong to any religion , but you are also allowed to practise your religion and by practising , it does mean putting religious buildings up
they do love playing divide and rule .
__quant1__ years ago , they divided and then enslaved the black population for no reason other than the advancement of the white race , at a direct cost to those of the blacks .
if they were capable of this just __quant1__ years ago , what makes you think they have changed since then ?
lol black people enslaved themselves in return for goods .
i guess black people were technologically disadvantaged and thus they were exploited because they were weak
yeah , he 's kinda banned .
he wont read this .
loss of 2,400 jobs at __name1__ in __name2__ , __name3__ ....
massive impact on employment in local area ...
loss of confidence in __name1__ ...
now that __name1__ has decided to close their massive operations centre in east __name2__ , impacting markedly on jobs and doubling the unemployment figures in one of the most deprived areas in the country ...
what now for that area and the rest of the __name1__ as far as chemistry @-@ related interests are concerned ?
only __quant2__ weeks ago , __name1__ claimed that the __quant1__ biggest pharmaceutical research centres in the country were committed to sustaining interests in the uk ...
and yet , here we are , __quant1__ weeks later with broken promises .
whilst this __name2__ @-@ led government claim to be working hard towards promoting growth from within the private sector , this example says far more about their failure to do so than any spin from __name1__ , to the contrary .
any pundits got an opinion ?
i 'm expecting the usual apologetics from the tories/libdems , but putting aside political partisanship , can anyone claim that this news is not devastating to economic recovery , remembering that the plant at __name1__ is not a viable enterprise because of being contaminated ?
( you need to be a local to know the levels of contanimation in the area and it 's deleterious impact on the surrounding environment and animal @/@ wild life .)
excuse me ?
i 've heard nothing of this widespread contamination - care to explain a little more ?
and if it 's so bad it 's hardly surprising that they want to leave is it .
your argument is rather confusing , it 's a contaminated , non @-@ viable enterprise and you 're shocked they want to leave ?
they have announced that the closure was nothing to do with government policy .
you can claim they are lying if you want ( why they would i have no idea ) .
and just for future reference , calling anyone putting forward an argument against you a " government apologist " basically destroys any argument you make , because the person reading the post ( well , me anyway ) is just thinking how childish and obtuse your being instead of evaluating any good points you may have had .
unfortunately , not all of the __quant1__ staff are high earning chemists .
most of them are blue collar workers ....
and redundancy payments have been cut by this government anyway .
and it 's got absolutely nothing to do with __quant1__ of incompetency and lack of initiative by the previous labour administration to put in place transport links as promised on time ...
let me guess , this is __name1__ all over again ! !!!
your hyperbole and complete and utter stupidity knows no bounds
he used to travel a lot to __name1__ , can ; t believe they 've pulled out now .
it 's ridiculous to see that cheap labour is being chosen over safety and security ...
not saying that __name1__ is n't but it 's true what they say , you get what you pay for : · cheap pharmaceutics production = low quality ...
this is what happens when people price themselves out of the market .
why should a business be forced to stay in a location where people demand higher wages , when there are people who will work for less elsewhere .
it 's simply how labour markets work .
yes because that is a very clever statement to make .
the fact is __name1__ are the ones massively at fault and they should have never taken prince __name2__ & __name3__ down that route .
they were clearly taken that way to provoke students and make them out to look bad .
well done politicians and media for being successful at portraying all students to be thugs .
i hope all of you who have branded students thugs never ever need a life saving operation because it will be a past student ( graduate ) carrying out the procedure to save your life - but then again why should you deserve help from people you branded as thugs ?
the police are the legalised thugs in all this and they make me absolutely sick .
i hope the __name1__ kettle and beat the hell out of police officers when they are rioting about being laid off and cuts are being made to the police budget .
lets see how they react when the tables are turned and they are putting in strikes which are far more damaging and cost the taxpayer more .
whole country and system is a joke .
can n't wait to get my degree and get out of this **** hole to pay tax where people respect students for trying to learn .
i won't be paying tax to help those moaning about today 's students .
save your own pension because i won't be paying for it and i hope other students do n't pay for it .
what was __name1__ doing with her window wound down .
was she trying to kidnap a protester ?
think you just about got your point across .
oh god .
that was when __name1__ went really weird and had an error message .
sorry everyone ....
they had someone on the news today pointing out that they had armed guards in there , and had things really kicked off he said and i quote : " it could have ended in tragedy , if they had been using petrol instead of paint , those armed guards might have been within their rights to shoot them "
beyond that , i think students need to go about their means a different way .
when the idiots who do n't represent the protestors start kicking off , protestors should just sit down ...
or avoid the whole situation altogether by doing something really positive .
like getting all those who oppose the tuition fee rises to give blood on the same day .
one of the reasons students are supposed to be so great is because they are innovative .
channel all of that to a modern way of protesting which means that the cause can not be hijacked and i believe that they will be much more succesful ( although i completely disagree with them )
nobody deserves to be have their car attacked
this is so true , attacking a car is just over the top ! !
it is disgraceful , but i must admit i could n't suppress a giggle when i saw the photo of them on the cover of the __name1__ this morning .
so the consensus seems to be that it is okay for a mob to dictate what roads we can and cannot go down ?
interesting but i do n't agree with that .
wow !
i mean ...
wow !
possibly the dumbest assumption on this subject i have seen , and there have been so many .
believe me , the students do n't need to be made to look bad - their behaviour is doing that already .
my __quant1__ piece of advice to anyone interested in the discussion on university fees is ...
read the facts __value1__ .
the vast majority of students seem to be getting their information from idiot friends , __name1__ postings , __name2__ propaganda or just plain making it up .
here is my top __quant1__ important facts you should all be aware of : · the £9000 figure being quoted is the maximum that a university will be able to charge per year .
obviously they can charge a lot less if they want/can .
previously the maximum fee was £3290 but then they had lots of government ( i.e . tax payer ) subsidy then .
if universities charge £6000 or more they need to abide by strict access agreements with the ' __name1__ ' to allow lower income students to attend .
if they do n't stick to the agreements then __name1__ can fine them up to £500,000 .
for low income students there is the newly set up £150m national scholarship programme which will pay for the __value1__ year of their course .
if universities charge £6000 or more for a course then any student who would have been eligible for free school meals ( if they were at school ) would have their __value1__ year tuition fees paid for by the university .
this can actually mean that for a __quant2__ year course they only pay for __quant1__ year !
maintenance grants for households earning less than £25,000 raises from £2906 to £3250 __quant2__ year .
households earning up to £42,000 can still get a partial grant .
the reason for the increase to the cap is because the universities will get less money in subsidies and have to be more independent .
if the fees are n't increased then the uni 's will have to provide either less courses or lower the quality of courses which is not good for anyone and would make __name1__ qualifications less valuable in the world job market .
plus , foreign students who pay the full fees ( much more than __name1__ students ) will go elsewhere for more valuable qualifications meaning even less money for uk uni 's .
the students will not have to pay back these student loans until they earn £21,000 __quant1__ year or more ( increased from £15,000 previously ) .
even if the students earn £21,000 these are interest free loans .
if they earn more then they will have to pay a small amount of interest up to __value1__ % ( plus inflation ) for incomes of £41,000 __quant1__ year or more .
if they have not cleared the debt __quant1__ years after graduating then the loan is wiped clean .
the __name1__ says that only about __value1__ % of graduates will end up paying back more than they borrowed .
the rest will pay back either what they owed ( interest free ) or less because they reach the __quant1__ year cut off .
suddenly it does n't seem quite so bad .
agree with everything above , but try telling that to the sh*t for brain idiots who believe everything they come across they are entitled to , and whenever they want it .
they have nothing to do with the fees increasing .
how would you like it if someone hit you for no reason ... ?
there was n't a single part of my post that implied they were responsible for the fees increasing .
they did n't get hit , they got a smashed window and paint on their car .
if you 're going to quote me , i 'd appreciate it if you did n't alter what i say to suit you .
or at least make it more clear where the alterations begin , and where my actual comments end .
in any case , i assume that you would be angry if a group of people surrounded your car and smashed the windows while shouting threats .
i might suggest that you would think it was , " just over the top ."
i was correcting your statement as it was the car that got attacked .
and honestly im not that fussed .
now be quiet or i 'll kick your car !
lol
i know they did n't get hit .
you said in your post that you would laugh at __name1__ if she got hit .
it 's just appeared on the __name1__ wires and the __name2__ live coverage .
people who spilled over from the " protest " attacked their car as it went down __name1__ .
no harm done to them , apparently .
looks like the mob is spilling over .
1 @-@ who cares about them ?
2 @-@ do they care about us ?
1 @-@ no one .
2 @-@ no .
maybe they 'll act against these stupid politicians then .
i would much rather the __name1__ in charge than some __name2__ bigots anyway .
__name1__ is a right laugh and would be great as a proper leader for this country , even __name2__ .
leader ?
countries do n't need leaders , the leaders of a country are the very people who live there .
leave the masochist ideas for later , please .
trip to reality for the royals
they 're just people born into priviledge .
not worse than anyone else
im not supporting the students , im just wondering why its any worse than if it were ordinary people ?
royals do not deserve special treatment , they 're just ordinary people
it 's important - a group of protestors overwhelmed the police escort .
that sort of thing is not supposed to happen .
as for disliking them - you might not , but they 're still people .
nobody deserves to be attacked just for being born into the ' wrong ' kind of family , be it very poor , or very rich .
they got attacked by being born in that kind of family .
i got my loans risen by being born in that kind of family .
we got beaten .
they too .
simple .
life is hard i know .
the point is n't that the attack was minor , it was that it could happen at all .
royal security is supposed to be better .
one day i would get some __name1__ users and we will beat almost to death all members of the __name3__ except the __name2__ .
some users who depend on masochism neg me .
it feels good .
hate them both .
would n't be surprised if the police escort let the students attack them on purpose .
just for lols at __name1__ getting floored .
rich people need to feel fear too .
like us .
agree with __value1__ poster - __name1__ should have more power .
well , __name1__ should , anyway .
no problem , let 's go backwards .
let 's destroy everything elderly __name1__ people fought for .
they will die soon , who care about what they can think about it ?
let 's take the monarchy back and cut people 's rights .
i love your idea , milord .
ergh , they 'll raise the fees again to pay for the damage done to the car
i enjoyed __name1__ 's comment about the attack being an insult to democracy , seems a touch ironic when discussing the __name2__ , no ?
democracy ?
with monarchy ?
wtf ?
monarchy by itself erases great part of the meaning of democracy .
it 's like trying to make fire in the middle of the ocean in water surface .
i think you 'll find they fought " for king and country "...
i have fallen in love with your comment .
love me .
leader ?
are they ?
that 's funny because i think the majority of the current __name3__ population are under the illusion that we are under the leadership of __name1__ & __name2__ .
or those __quant1__ seem to think that its only their opinions that matter .
the __name1__ is not a full democracy and we as the people of the uk never vote on all the main issues .
we also hardly ever get listened to on the majority of topics .
they fought for the country ( if it was ruled by a king okay , but that was something out of their reach ) .
the king likes being king for the power and nothing else , otherwise he would be begging to be taken his position as soon as possible .
why would someone fight for someone who would not fight for you had the king the chance ?
lol .
< __quant1__ year old __name1__ chat
sensitive subject again ?
no.
at least i know i 've been laid without feeling the need to broadcast the fact i got a girlfriend over the net .
i picture you as being will off __name1__ - a briefcase ****er up his own ass .
and yeah i know those things because i have visited loads of uni 's , and it does n't take a genius to see the differences .
but sure , keep telling yourself its all based on some guy with a clipboard .
all the league tables are based on someone with a clipboard going around taking __quant1__ report of everything at that university and also you do n't know what university is better until you 've actually been lectured there or had an experience as a student there .
all the league tables are a load of rubbish .
it entirely depends on how the students uses what he @/@ she has at his @/@ her disposal .
i also find it funny how you 've said you 've visited loads of universities - there are over 100 universities in the __name1__ .
any normal person with a job would n't be able to visit many so therefore i take it your unemployed .
hmm , it 's strange anyone goes to the best unis .
no idea why they 're so competitive .
because people want to be able to say " i went to cambridge/oxford " with a smug look on their face as if they are better than anyone else .
no they really are not .
they normally lack any form of social interaction and can not get on in the real world .
i 've employed __name1__ and __name2__ graduates and they have n't a ****ing clue in it to be honest .
i do n't know about other industries but they are extreme nerds that no employer really wants .
an employer wants a normal person with the skills , not a freak of nature nerd who loves books and goes home every night to practice binary and hex .
and seriously , shut up about __name1__ .
no one cares .
well why think you know better when clearly i have experience in the sector .
you may know more about another sector and that 's fair enough .
to say no one cares is speaking on behalf of everyone else which you do not have the right to do .
you 're cute .
you 're gay .
read it again .
i never said no @-@ one likes you .
i said there will be no people like you there .
no people like me .
i know .
i 'm not a bookworm virgin .
you enjoy your time at your posh university with all your yuppie colleagues - hope you do well and have a good time because when you come out and are scared in the real world because mummy and daddy are not around and you 're a severe introvert due to having your head stuck in the book .
basically like this .
i love how you are so smug and up your own ass - people in the real world will just put you in your place or **** you up on any occasion as you think you are always right when you are clearly not .
enjoy your time with the privately educated posh tw@s you will meet there .
even better you probably are one .
you 'll fit right in
hahahaha !
every single bit is priceless .
thanks for a good laugh !
tell me how your democratic rights is being infringed by having a monarch , go on tell me ...
the fact is the prime minister has all the de @-@ facto power , he @/@ she is the person giving the orders during times of crisis , he @/@ she is the person who decides policy .
the monarchy is an effective system of checks and balances and nothing more , it infringes on no one 's right for democracy .
oh and before someone jumps up and down and yells but we do n't elect our head of state and so that 's bad and we are n't free , __name2__ is frequently voted as the most democratic nation on __name1__ and guess what they have ...
yup a monarch .
this was a disgraceful act of violence and would have been whether it was against a citizen or anyone else .
what makes it more worrying is that this is the heir to the throne , that used to mean something ....
the very fact that we have to pay them is enough to affect your rights .
and what equality means .
you should look up the meaning of monarchy in the dictionary .
just that .
i do n't care if people vote a country without knowing about it .
if __name1__ is the most voted it does not mean that it is the most democratic .
of course it was an act of violence but it looks like the event of the day .
many people are attacked ( and killed , and raped ) everyday .
so stop making polemic .

i share the views of several others in this thread that i would n't want the __name1__ in goverment - but that 's not a concern of course .
i do , however , want to see a handful of __name1__ mps in __name2__ .

if the __name1__ make a good show for the next election , like this time , i will probably give them my vote again .
the __name1__ only got __value1__ % of the vote here .
now that 's my kinda logic .
i was disappointed with the __name1__ and __name2__ results , as well as __name3__ and __name4__ 's lack of decent gains ...

in a __name3__ local seat the __name1__ candidate was only about 20 votes from beating the __name2__ , grr !
( and over 2000 from winning .)
originally posted by candyflipper · despite their national share actually falling very slightly overall , the __name1__ has done very well with its target seats .

but obviously most importantly they have gained their __value1__ ever mp , __name1__ in __name2__ .
this is the best news of the election for me , as a supporter of a small party , this shows that it can be done .
it 's so nice to see a colour on the map there that is n't red/blue/yellow ( that is n't __name1__ , __name2__ or __name3__ .)
<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/nol/shared/election2010/results/constituency/a69.stm"> this </a> is the vote share , and __name1__ from __name2__ to greens that allowed this to happen .
what does everyone think of this then ?
i 'm sure people who actually support the __name1__ must be delighted , given that i am and i do n't even support their ( economic ) policies .
did n't think they 'd go down well with a __name1__
but anyway , i 'm delighted .
anyone with a brain knows they 're not a single issue party at all and it 's great to see a left wing party make a break through , especially in this election .

if everyone has everything they need , why is there any need for innovation ?
why would people bother to produce anything on time ?
why can people not set up private businesses on their property - why are you making this illegal ?
you are denying them their basic rights .
it is exactly " aspirations and ****", and the desire to have what you want and not just what you need , that has led to the invention of nearly everything that has improved our lives .

you 've made that point fifty million times now .
and it is n't even relevant .
__name1__ also gained enormously from other colonies such as the __name2__ and __name3__ , but it is n't giving aid to those countries .
reasons :
1 ) there is no politicial motive / need / purpose in doing so .
2 ) there is not extensive poverty which is needed to justify the giving of aid on humanitarian grounds .

because of this mr smith was left with no money to look after his own children and so they were forced to live in poverty .
the smith and the jones children are now all grown up , and whilst the jones children have inherited a lot of money from their dad the smith children are still poverty striken .
do you think that morally the jones children have any obligation to give back to the smith 's the ill gotten money they inherited from their father ?
in that case the __name1__ have a moral obligation to us for benefitting from the __name2__ expoitation of __name3__ .
originally posted by grim_the_reaper · in that case the __name1__ have a moral obligation to us for benefitting from the __name2__ expoitation of __name3__ .
the __name1__ =/= modern __name2__ .
besides there is a difference between something __quant1__ of years ago and something quite recent that is easier to measure .
i do n't believe they are giving this aid for entirely charitable reasons .
to put in bluntly its like a bribe .
__name1__ is very poor person but the economy has been growing massively in the past __quant1__ years .
as people have said __name1__ buys arms from overseas .
the __name1__ is one of the worlds biggest arms suppliers so they want to increase sales .
also as __name1__ middle class grows they will buy more consumer goods - the __name2__ will want a piece of this pie .
world and regional politics also play a role .
__name1__ is a very important country in that region so its useful for __name2__ interests to have close relations especially with our troops in __name3__ .
in the future __name1__ may be a threat to __name2__ interests .
just like the __name3__ __name1__ suffers from terrorism coming from __name2__ .
close cooperation will benefit both countries .
some poster said we should give the money to __name1__ @- why ?
- so they can send more people here to blow themselves up ?
so there are a number of reasons why its in the __name1__ 's interests to give this money .

if you 're gonna take credit for the good stuff , dont forget to take credit for the bad stuff that went on too , you hypocrite .
the resources wouldve been used for __name1__ 's gain rather than the __name2__ 's .
what about it ?
you have a distorted view on __name1__ , what can i say ?
thats my opinion .
oh , i 'll admit there was plenty of bad , but i 'll not have us blamed for the bad that really does n't lay at our door , like people starving .
so yes , if you want to talk about various instances of brutality and overuse of force by __name1__ officers , then i 'll not deny it , but i 'll not accept responsibility for not feeding everyone in a country when the concept of a welfare state was alien even in home territories .
and no , do n't be so naive .
if __name1__ was n't there , or to be more accurate , if some colonial force wasn ; t there , the resources would n't be .
there would be noone producing and refining them , no market for export etc.
no , i have an objective view , yours ' is distorted
in __name1__ , salt was discovered even before the __name2__ arrived .
you hate __name1__ and wish to see them all dead , yeah thats kind of objective
exactly , i mean despite living in the __name1__ we have managed to preserve not only our culture but also our values and morals .
it just seems so unjust and extremely hypocritical , i mean __name1__ on one hand , is literally making __name2__ an awful place for most to live in , yet he himself and the higher class are occupied indulging in a completely __name3__ lifestyle .
i mean in my eyes , all politicians are power hungry .
i mean my parents are pretty supportive of __name1__ , he sure does seem a lot better than the rest of them , but at the end of the day how much can __quant1__ man achieve when the rest of the government is corrupt .

sorry my point was n't clear , but i always though that __name1__ was founded to be a __name2__ state , is that not correct ?
__value1__ but yes definitely , i think __name1__ led a lifestyle more lavish than most higher class __name2__ today .
it 's just the side of __name1__ i 've always seen is literally a world away from what i saw , i think i 've always known that the higher class are extremely different to most other pakistanis but actually seeing it is a whole other feeling .
my mum was born and brought up here like me , and my dad came here at a young age , so both are very different to most of my __name1__ friends ' parents .
i think their outlook is slightly different , yet i think somehow the __name1__ values have been instilled in me .
and of course , no culture is superior to the next , but when __name1__ was created with a certain vision its sad to see it all wither away not too long after , if that makes sense ?
i guess the more i think about it , it 's true .
there has always been a group that has been a lot more in tune with __name1__ society than the rest , but does n't that group seem to be continuously expanding ?
anyways there was a quote that i read recently by __name1__ about __name2__ , i can n't seem to find it at the moment , i 'll post it to you later .
definitely !
i mean i think to a certain extent it 's perfectly fine , every country in a way is influenced by __name1__ media , but it 's just sad to see the country and people lose their values .
yeah unfortunate isnt it .
i think the country is deteriorating fast .
so much corruption aswell .
its no wonder they 're not doing well economically .
because salt alone stops starvation and is the basis of a flourishing economy ...
you 've gotten more trollish of late .
it 's quite sad .

__name1__ was a new nation , salt would not have sustained it but it wouldve gone a long way .
salt wasnt the only natural resource .
do you have proof of this ?
its not an accusation , you 've been saying it for a while now
i apologise in advance if there is something similar to this thread , but this is a topic that has interested me recently and would just like to hear your views on the matter .
i 'm a __name1__ __name2__ , born and brought up in __name3__ , however i would say i am very much in touch with my roots and my views lean more towards the traditional and conservative side .
recently __quant1__ watched a documentary by __name1__ ' don't tell my mother i am in pakistan ', made a few years ago , yet a very interesting watch .
i have been on holiday to __name1__ a fair amount of times , and have traveled throughout the country , so i thought i had a pretty accurate idea of the country as a whole and it 's people .
however , after watching the documentary and various other programs and films on __name1__ i am absolutely shocked .
i may be wrong when i say this , but was __name1__ not founded as a __name2__ state , yet only __quant1__ years on and i do n't think the country matches the vision it was initially created with .
it seems that the higher class are obsessed with imitating and adopting __name1__ culture , in a sense it boosts their superiority complex .
i actually find it shocking , that most families who moved to __name1__ in the 60 's like my grandfather have managed to maintain that cultural pride and certain traditions that have been lost among certain groups of people in __name2__ .
drinking is a common practice with the upper class society and personally i find it quite upsetting , it seems as if __name1__ is moving in the opposite direction @- the rich becoming more obsessed with __name2__ culture and the less well off being neglected further .
also whilst i 'm on this topic , has anyone seen the film ' __name1__ ' and what were your views ?
thank for reading my thoughts !

not to forget __value1__ tradition of <a href="http://www.dawn.com/2011/09/07/bartered-in-marriage-the-bride-exchange-in-rural-pakistan.html"> __value1__ marriages </a> , young girls forcefully married to much older men , and __value1__ in extreme cases married __name1__ quran itself !
one wonders why __name1__ is the <a href="http://in.reuters.com/article/2011/06/15/idinindia-57704120110615"> world __value1__ third most dangerous country for women </a> to live in ?
yet you 're worried about upper classes choosing to indulge in a bit of harmless fun ?
as a __name1__ , i welcome __name2__ influence on our culture - it might help pakistan to become a more civilized society .
edit : __quant1__ watched that __name1__ 's documentary you 're referring to a few months ago .
i would like to know what you found so offensive ?
she was sympathetic to the plight of transgender community in __name1__ - is n't that a positive thing ?
liberalization is moving in the opposite direction ?
personally , any nation 's judiciary system that is in anyway influenced by objective morality scriptures and superstition has no place in the __century1__ st century .
while i can understand your sentiment that is undesirable for tradition to be dismantled , ever since the fall of the wall in __year1__ , liberal democratic values have spread ( __name3__ , __name2__ , __year2__ ) and that does not preclude ( just yet ) the sovereign states whom are conformed to __name1__ teachings as their rule of law .
__name1__ culture gives people individuality and lets them choose whether to follow conservatism or choose their own destiny and the right to enjoy any liberties they desire ( as long as it does n't harm anybody else ) .
i think it is the right direction that __name1__ culture ( unforced ) is spreading , it gives a common ground for different cultures to interact , promotes tolerance and allows people to pick their own way of life .
i do n't see that being a problem .
sorry , in hindsight i really do think i should have written the post a little better .
i do not think our culture is perfect , there are many traditions that i do believe in at all and am strongly against , yet i do think that the moral values taught through culture and religion should definitely be retained .
following your point , i think that to an extent in the __century1__ st century we require a society based on basic morals and values , i feel that these are the foundations .
i agree with you in the sense that __name1__ culture does encourage individuality , definitely !
it has helped to shape the country , allowed women to have more rights and freedom .
i mean now in __name1__ , it is common for women to work and i totally support this .
women should have as much right as any man .
i think the next step forward in __name2__ is adopting the __name1__ idea of equality , which is severely lacking there .
it has a lot to do with the government , when the politicians are corrupt , there is little hope for the country .
what __name1__ needs is a strong leader , focused on the well @-@ being of it 's people rather than power and money .
the westernisation of anything __name2__ can only be a good thing , __name1__ economy , culture and society is way advanced and more civilised and humane .
we 're talking about __name1__ here , not __name2__ .
my knowledge of __name1__ and the situation there is not really good enough to debate on the subject .
i know , just pointing out that __name1__ has been known to use some vicious sectarian @-@ inciting policies .
they sought to maintain confusion and violence in __name1__ by pitting various local religious strands against each other , to stop them from uniting against __name2__ rule .
just a side note , do carry on .
at the time , an __name3__ that includes present day __name4__ would have been ruled by the __name2__ majority __name1__ , which __name5__ feared would totally ignore their rights and wants , with the added context of widespread sectarian violence , that is why __name5__ felt they must have a seperate nation .
also , the __name1__ rejected various proposals at federal deals and so forth .
really , thats just bogus , as threat of secretarian violence had the apostles of pacifism in __name1__ surrendering to the great evil of partition , the very thing they wanted to avoid , so are these leaders the type to impose , please .....
no __name1__ majority due to caste divisions , so who is majority ?
again __name1__ model would have been best option , with stong regional states with regional laws and a weak centre.majority of people __year1__ did not want partition · __name2__ has as many __name4__ faith people as __name3__ , so what was the point jeez .
anyway whats done is done , this is just discussion over something that highly unlikely will ever be reversed , unlike __name3__ , so better if __name1__ and __name2__ can get along and workk for the betterment of the common people , like sewers , better roads , hunger , this is what unites people , regardless of what faith , feeding your family ...
frankly , i 'm all for the balanced ' westernisation ' if that 's what you want to call it .
i call it freedom , that just so by happened to be promoted by the __name1__ media .

__name1__ turned __name2__ basically back to time of __name3__ empire , where indian nation was .
the __name2__ forced it 's creation because they would not negotiate any sort of settlement to appease the fears of the __name1__ .
both sides had equal parts , but this absurd claim that because the __name1__ did not want the partition meant they had no hand in it is absurd .
no such thing , as settlements were there , and again the quote clearly shows who started the ethnic cleansing , check the detail in the attached link , · pure facism the __quant1__ nation theory , nothing democratic about .
__name1__ did not want the partition @-@ basic fact , they surrendered to the violence going on :

why had the fearful great migration come to pass ?
why were millions of people wrenched from their ancestral homes and driven toward an unknown , often unwanted " __name1__ "?
for __quant1__ __name1__ and __name2__ had struggled side by side for independence from __name3__ rule .
with freedom finally on the horizon why should __name1__ begin to tear herself in two along religious lines ?
the overt act that split __name1__ began in the streets of __name2__ .
but the decision was made in __name1__ .
it was a __quant1__ @-@ man decision , and the man who made it was cool , calculating , unreligious .
this determination to establish a separate __name1__ state came not -- one might have expected -- from some __name2__ divine in archaic robes and flowing beard , but from a thoroughly westernized , __name3__ @-@ educated attorney @-@ at @-@ law with a clean @-@ shaven face and razor @-@ sharp mind .
__name1__ , leader of the __name2__ and the architect of __name3__ , had for many years worked at the side of __name5__ and __name6__ for a free , united __name4__ , until in the evening of his life he broke with his past to achieve a separate pakistan .

lets see more
the __name1__ government did little in __name4__ to stop the __name2__ violence against __name3__ that began on __month1__ __day1__ .
after __quant1__ week of communal conflict some 5,000 people were dead with more than 15,000 injured , and about 100,000 were homeless .
chief minister __name1__ and the __name2__ cabinet were blamed for declaring __name3__ a public holiday and not stopping the violence .
viceroy __name1__ visited __name2__ and then met with __name3__ and __name4__ .
__name1__ wanted to postpone the __name2__ , but the home government insisted the interim government be inaugurated on __month1__ __day1__ . the __name3__ urged people to protest by calling that day a black day , and hundreds died in the communal violence that broke out in __name4__ and __name5__ .
__name1__ learned in __month1__ that __quant1__ people had been killed and __quant2__ injured in __name2__ .
the __quant1__ @-@ year @-@ old peacemaker went on a “ village @-@ a @-@ day pilgrimage , ” walking __quant2__ miles in __quant3__ weeks .
__name1__ suggested a compromise that was accepted , and on __month1__ __day1__ the __name2__ agreed to join the interim government .
__name1__ members took office on __month1__ __day1__ , but __name2__ still held back .
__name1__ @-@ __name1__ invited the leaders to meet in __name2__ in __month1__ .
__name1__ gained some assurances and stayed on to give speeches warning the __name4__ that if they did not grant __name3__ , there would be civil war in __name2__ .
__name1__ refused to attend the __name2__ on __month1__ __day1__ .
democratic or not , when one party has more votes than the other :
meanwhile , __name1__ 's efforts to set up a short @-@ term coalition @/@ interim government at the centre had also broken down .
__name1__ wanted a ratio of __value1__ __name3__ __name2__ , __value1__ __name5__ __name4__ , __value1__ __name6__ , and __value1__ scheduled caste representation in the proposed government .
the __name1__ rejected it .
proportional representation could easily have happened

end of the day what done is done , no going back really , __name1__ and __name2__ have to come to better and friendly relationship , and even after some time a sort of __name3__ type area , wheere the common people of that area can have better welfare .
good luck to people of __name1__
yea i find that really wierd @- i 've never fully understood why thats the case for some people
read through this thread
hard for me to answer as i 've probably been over doctrinated from __name1__ ideals .
however i believe that if westernisation means __name1__ become more liberated and open/ tolerant to other beliefs/culture/style then i 'm all for it , ( of course , i 'm hoping that this would outweigh the exploitive constraints that comes with westernisation ) .
once these dictators get overthrown , who only raise their voices once their precious soldiers get killed ( not when their civilians are dying in the thousands ) , then maybe , __name1__ can return to its vision .
why are you living here ?
oh yeah because __name1__ is a poverty stricken , __value1__ world , failed state ....
silly me .
yet , it was n't too long when your own nation was burning people on the stake because they do n't float on water .
power changes , do n't be foolish enough to think it won't change again .
let 's make this nice and easy for you .
all of the castes are .....
that 's right , __name1__ .
so despite caste divisions , they have a vast majority , and are likely to follow a __name1__ agenda over a __name2__ one .
stop arguing this non @-@ point .
oh my gosh , this is like talking to a brick wall .
the __name1__ had a huge majority .
therefor anything which favours the __name1__ will have a majority , therefor to the __name2__ , a democratic majority means nothing
let us assume a country is __value1__ % __name1__ and __value2__ % __name2__ , would you just wave through any law or legislation based on the fact it 's a democratic majority ?
now , do n't be silly here , i am not equating __name1__ or __name2__ to __name3__ , merely making an analogy .
dear me , lets be clear a lable of __name1__ means jack , especially when what is in hindu scriptures is not being followed , so what is point of hindu label ?
well , dont you know of the caste prejudices that some carry out so how can thye be __name1__ majority when the some of the people go with their caste of tribe __value1__ , dearie
next pathetic e.g. of __name1__ , pathetic
democratic will of people was against great evil of partition and thats a facts , proportional representation was given and thats a fact !
yes deny democracy when representation was there ! !
talking of __name1__ , and fascim the __quant1__ nation theory is exactly that hence ethnic cleansing campaigns began in __name2__ area , and later spread :
<a href="http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/muslim_league_attack_on_sikhs_and_hindus_in_the_punjab_1947"> http://www.sikhiwiki.org/index.php/m...he_punjab_1947 </a>
j. a. scott , deputy inspector @-@ general of police in the __name1__ range , in a statement to the press , declared :
“ it is unbelievable that barbarous acts such as were committed on innocent people in rural areas of the __name1__ could be possible in the __name2__ .
all these atrocities on __name1__ and __name2__ brought no condemnation whatever from the __name3__ leaders .
they either kept silent about them , or continued to trot out imaginary atrocities on __name1__ .
this not only encouraged the __name1__ goondas , but gave them the confidence that they could go on safely with the blessings of the __name2__ leaders .
you seem like those stupid football hooligans .
why did you mention __name1__ ?
__name1__ did n't originate in pakistan , most muslims are not __name2__ , and the pakistani government is n't even ruling by islamic laws .
idiot .
and how do you even know that i am not __name1__ or partly english ?
__name1__ is being westernised , and with it will come rational thought , less religious nutcases and greater economic prosperity .
the success story of the __name1__ is being projected worldwide , unfortunately ...
i fear that some beautiful cultures may be displace by a monolithic , boring __name1__ culture .
i would answer this if it were not for the ad @-@ hominem attacks and insults .
oh please , the only person bending over backwards for __name2__ was __name1__ .
of course __name1__ did not want the partition , the __name2__ rather , they wanted to rule the whole of __name1__ , and regardless of caste , it would have been a __name3__ majority .
by that logic then , __name2__ should be __name1__ ?
various empires have ruled various landmasses at various times , that does n't make that a nation .
at the time of the __name1__ starting it 's gradual rise to power in india , there was no india in the sense of a single nation .
it was a patchwork of independant kingdoms , states and wastelands .
oh you are the witty one .
oh , and what 's that ?
oh yes , a total lack of sourcing for any of your claims when they are challenged .
i notice you tried to dodge it .
poor form my dear , poor form .
no , as i epxlained to yo , u the ashokan __name1__ was one nation with borders from __name2__ to __name3__ .
youre an idiot plain and simple and have been disproven by at least 3 different people on this thread already .
the problem with idiots , is they are usually the __value1__ people to recognise the fact .
its all about class and wealth ....
the wealth middle classes are westernised , due to education , travel etc ( and they tend to be less religous ) etc.....
my gfs family are from __name1__ and they 're typical pakistani rahs ( __name2__ outlook , but still hold onto thier pakistani @/@ __name3__ cultural heritage .
i went to __name1__ in __month1__ , the __name2__ hols after __quant1__ years , and was absolutely shocked to see girls in __name3__ walking about in denim mini skirts with no tights , tight sleeveless tops and highlighted short short hair !
to see this is __name1__ absolutely shocked me , we here have more culture within us than them over there..
my cousins even told me about undercover nightclubs where people go and get drunk..
my dad said its all signs of the day of judgement , one of the signs is that __name1__ will disappear in the __name2__ and rise again from the west..
and i can actually see this happening ...
now you know how many __name1__ feel ........
and that 's a bad thing why ?
westernisation = progress .
imitating the most developed countries in the world is n't really a bad thing .
__name1__ was founded on the basis that muslims felt their interests would not be guarded by a __name3__ government , not as some spiritual __name2__ homeland .
as it is , i 'd hardly say __name2__ is ' __name1__ ', what with it 's blasphemy laws , it 's constant conflict with __name3__ , conservative populace , tacit funding and support for various __name4__ organisations .
i think rather than worrying about the populace , worry about yourself .
who are you to judge people if they wish to drink alcohol , or watch __name1__ tv ?
also , as you bemoan the __name1__ .
it 's worth remembering you would n't have had a country without us
what ?
explain yourself ...
__name2__ was created by __name1__ .
without us __name2__ would have been another province of __name1__ .
well , that 's difficult to say , without the __name1__ in __name2__ who knows what would have happened .
but my point is , it was __name1__ that created , or allowed the creation of , __name2__ .
yes , the conference held by the __name3__ __name2__ and attended by representatives from __name4__ and __name5__ where the bangladeshis put the amount of dead at 300,000 was clearly some kind of elaborate __name1__ conspiracy .
the __name1__ figure is near 30,000 by the way not 300,000 .
the situation in __name1__ and __name2__ is regrettable and i genuinely feel the pain of those living in these areas but it 's wrought with complications @- not something i expect someone only intent on slandering my country to understand .
you have been completely blown out of the water .
you can now argue yourself if you wish
except that the article posted clearly stated various bangladeshi politicians in __name1__ stated the death toll to be in the millions .
and they state as many of the independant political commentators and most of the rest of the worlds on @-@ lookers that __name1__ attempted genocide in __name2__ - which __name3__ was able to eventually thwart .
but of course pakistanis deny all this so it must be innacurate
sorry but credibility is hardly your strong point .
if __name3__ had any real amnimoty toward pakistanis or __name4__ in general , they had the opportunity to completly bomb most of its cities to oblivion soon after defeating paksitans army - as the __name1__ did to nazii __name2__ at the end of the war .
but they didnt , they chose to forgive and forget - unfortunatly extremism in __name1__ has never left its conciousness even after these sorts of events .
i too feel sorry for the balouchis , who had no problems lviing alongside other indians for a __quant1__ years or so and now are oppressed by fanatics under a pakistani flag .
yep __name1__ whipped up extremism for __quant1__ then gave them a home by carving out __name2__ allowing it to fester .
probably the only accurate point you have ever made on __name1__ .
oh please .
__name1__ did not ' whip up extremism ', __name1__ recognised different religious groups , and encouraged all religious groups to have their own identity .
a mistake , but not really ' whipping up extremism '.
it 's not __name1__ 's fault that once these religious types realised their own identity they felt the need to start killing people and engaing in sectarian violence .
yes , that 's right , systematic rape and the cold blooded torture and murder of around 90,000 people is unavoidable .
as is the the killing of perhaps over 10,000 __name1__ by mobs armed to the teeth and supported by the police .
please concentrate on admitting all this and not trying to justify them .
yes there 's a cause and effect for everything but unfortunately for you this includes so called __name1__ terrorism @- note how these acts are irrevocably linked to the persecution of muslims/ invasions etc.
i have already said the genocide is a massive blot on the face of __name1__ @- regardless " millions " were n't killed , estimates by neutral historians are around 300,000 dead .
the __name1__ and __name2__ authorities obviously give wildly biased figures .
right , the __name1__ pirates were enslaving " kaffirs " because the just @-@ founded __name2__ was invading the __name3__ and persecuting __name4__ .
idiot .
it always makes me laugh when people suggest there is no pattern between so called __name1__ extremism and the oppression of __name2__ .
i know a __name3__ man at university whose mother was killed during an __name4__ airstrike and whose brother was buried alive when their house was bulldozed @- now tell me how likely is this man to turn to violence than a __name1__ living comfortably in the suburbs of __name2__ ?
that 's a rhetorical question in case you did n't realise that either .
of course there 's a pattern , but it pisses me off when people use some correlative events as exculpatory anecdotes for __name1__ uprising .
this is one of the worst posts i 've seen on __name2__ regarding __name1__ , and believe me , there 's a lot to choose from .
first of all , __name1__ did not immigrate to the point where they formed a majority :
[ <a __value1__ http://www.mideastweb.org/palpop.htm </a> - includes sources ]
secondly , the __name1__ did not divide __name2__ nor was the idea to establish a jewish homeland based on guilt from the __name3__ - how can you even say this nonsense ?
the only thing the __name1__ did was underline the need for a __name2__ homeland , an idea that that really came to fruition in the late __century1__ 's when __name3__ lead the __name4__ which then lead to the creation of the the __name5__ .
the pledge to create a __name1__ homeland in __name2__ came about with the __name3__ deceleration in __year1__ which was incorporated into a peace treaty during the san remo conference in __year2__ ( which included __name4__ , __name5__ , __name6__ , __name7__ and the __name8__ ) - this is at least __quant1__ decades before ww2 started .
expanding on the above , the idea to partition __name1__ originated around __year1__ with the __name2__ which was then followed up by the __name3__ ( later evaluated at the __name4__ ) - these were __name5__ en @-@ devours , not nefarious __name6__ plans .
the idea to partition arose due to the understanding that __name1__ and __name2__ interests were irreconcilable - during this , violence was increasing more and more .
the __name1__ wanted out of __name2__ as soon as possible and as such , they handed power over to the __name3__ in __year1__ .
the __name1__ then established __name2__ to devise a solution and they too came up with a partition plan which took the form of a __name3__ resolution - __name4__ declared independence according to the partition plan __quant1__ day before the __name5__ mandate was due to expire and in __year1__ they were admitted to the un so no , the __name6__ did not exceed their authority , gain a majority through immigration or come up with a nefarious plan to split __name7__ .
here 's a tip for you .
if you do n't want to expose yourself as being an anti @-@ semitic moron , then try not to say things like " i had a feeling you were a __name1__ " or "...
defender of the __name1__ ", trying replacing the word " __value1__ " with " __value2__ ", it 's much more covert .
do n't bother trying to say " but but i can n't be antisemitic because __name1__ are semitic and i do n't mind them ! "
- the term antisemitism was coined by the __name3__ @-@ hating __name2__ __name1__ in 1987~ and as such refers to jews , not semitic people .
i guess , according to your " logic ", __name1__ are n't allowed to ' defend ' themselves because the bastards have a habit of killing innocent __name2__ spanning from __year1__ up until __year2__
according to <a href="http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceid=000636#chart1"> http://israelipalestinian.procon.org... </a> <a href="http://israelipalestinian.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceid=000636#chart1"> = 000636#chart1 </a> __name1__ · jews were in the majority __year1__ about 1950 onwards .
as you can see from your charts , they increased as a percentage of the total population steadily before that ( although there was a big jump in __year1__ , when some 850 000 jewish people immigrated )
i believe there is little general denial that the __name1__ european states looked upon the setting up of a __name2__ state a lot more favourably after ww2 .
that does not mean it was a nefarious plan .
however they did mass immigrate , both before it became a state and afterwards .
they then took control .
according to my logic , you should punish the perpetrators , instead of a group of people which includes the perpetrators .
the state is not responsible as a whole for the firing of rockets .
however they are all punished .
the entire point of discrimination is to group a number of people together and act like they are all responsible for what a small percentage of that group has participated in . examples are people who blame every algerian immigrant they see for theft because algerians have a higher crime rate on average in their country , or all the __name1__ democrats getting murdered in a __decade1__ s __name2__ city because __quant1__ resisted the __name3__ or __name4__ .
however you might turn it , you have a colony in __year1__ with __value1__ % of its population being jewish .
in __year1__ that is __value1__ % ( <a __value2__ http://www.representativepress.org/israelhistory.html </a> ) .
they obtain control , do not listen to what the __name1__ tells them to do and discriminate against the population which used to compromise __value1__ % of the population __quant1__ years ago .
that is the fundamental fear of __name1__ societies who are afraid of immigration .
they have now almost split up into __quant1__ separate countries , where some inhabitants of one send a few rockets to the other side once a while .
the other side has invaded with soldiers and tanks , decided what is allowed into the country and harasses people from the other side several times __quant1__ day ( when they cross checkpoints or the border ) .
the division is nowhere near to how the __name1__ decided the country should be divided .
i strongly hope that on one side the new __name1__ government will open the border to allow any non @-@ arms kind of trade ( such as building materials ) and that the __name2__ government realizes that laws regarding freedom of speech issues ( such as a ban on speaking in favour of boycotting products from israeli settlements based in palestinia ) only create more frustration and are not in its long @-@ term interest .
because they people they are supposedly being ' defending ' themselves against are systematically having their rights taken away by __name1__ foreign policy who insist they life in a state of complete autonomy with no world recognition or any equality - and for that matter , subjecting __name2__ to torture , regularly bombing schools and hospitals and refusing to allow them the basic tools and materials to rebuild their society and economy .
i completely agree !
as an individual who is of __name1__ descent , ( i am also of __name2__ descent ) i do not agree with the mistreatment of anyone .
be it from my own people or not .
look at what he said when he was running for president .
he has said that he wants to " fundamentally transform " the country into something completely different , and i just do n't think that sounds like something someone who loves his people and country would say .
he wants the role of __name1__ diminished among the countries of the world .
as for anti @-@ __name1__ policies , there are so many .
here are some · he wants to take away free choice with regard to healthcare and put government in charge .
__name1__ was founded on free markets and capitalism so this is anti @-@ american · he has taken over many american businesses , again going against __name2__ free market principles .
he is trying to silence radio talk show hosts like __name1__ by implementing a regulatory scheme that would impose government controls on content instead of letting the free markets decide what the content should be .
this is in violation of free speech , another principle this country was founded on .
he is trying to use the __name1__ to control internet content , because he knows that as long as there is free speech online , people will be critical of him · he has had many loud and very public battles with __name2__ and __name3__ .
he wants a single party press , not the free __quant1__ that we have now .
he has repeatedly said that now that he is in power , the opposition should just shut up and get out of the way , and that goes against the __name1__ .
he wants to take away our __name1__ , the right to bear arms , which is an __name2__ civil liberty going back to the time the country was founded .
he believes in higher taxes and with more money taxed from people , they have less economic civil liberty .
more powerful government means less power for the people .
i believe that raising taxes is anti @-@ __name1__ .
you are twisting various things he has done , also __name1__ would have done at least __value1__ % of the same thing .
just because your political allegiance is to __name1__ and not him , doesnt mean that he is anti @-@ __name2__ ...
just means that he is a __name1__ no ?
but no , i dont believe he is anti @-@ __name1__ at allll
come on , you know thats rubbish..
also dont make me laugh , __name1__ free market ? ...
why did you give so much money to __name1__ then ? ..
if you were really free market , you 'd have let them all crash and burn..
btw this wasnt just __name1__ but also __name2__ ! ..
so __name1__ is anti @-@ __name2__ now right ?
__name1__ was wrong to try to bail everything out too .
i was not a fan of __name1__ , he was a left wing progressive who was almost as bad as __name2__
__name1__ is in my opinion , the __name2__ version of __name3__ .
in other words - a conservative in name only .
i have been very disappointed with __name1__ , and greatly wish that there was a real conservative in charge of the __name2__ and the country .
some would argue that romney is the only candidate who can beat __name1__ , since he is a moderate who can appeal to swing voters .
the same sort of thing was said about __name1__ - that the __name2__ needed someone like him to detoxify the brand and appeal to all of society .
in both cases this is , in my opinion , nonsense .
__name1__ ran from an ideologically truly conservative platform .
he won against __name1__ ( who was very similar to __name2__ ) and got re @-@ elected with one of the biggest landslides ever .
also , in __name2__ , __name1__ who ran from ideologically truly conservative platform , was re @-@ elected with a landslide not once but twice .
what did wishy washy liberal " conservative " __name1__ achieve ?
a hung parliament when the election was an open goal .
if __name1__ gets the nomination , he will lose .
__name1__ needs a __name2__ , and __name3__ needs a __name4__ .
the problem with that thinking is that you ignore __quant1__ years of political development .
__name1__ and __name2__ both beat ideological left wingers in __name3__ and __name4__ .
whatever you think about obama , he is quite centralist with a lot of his failings coming from the fact he has tried to work across the aisle even when he had a supermajority .
since __year1__ both the __name1__ and the __name2__ and seen the left triangulate the right through ' __value1__ way ' to capture the centre ground leading to the electoral success of __name3__ and __name4__ .
a right wing ideologue won't win now as they need to win the centre who generally prefer more moderate candidates .
you change your tune quickly .
i remember not long ago you were defending __name1__ as the best thing since __name2__ ...
why would you ask the __name1__ ?
the only people that should be asked is the __name3__ , do they want to be apart of the __name2__ or __name1__ .
if you are going to ask the whole of __name2__ then you should be asking the rest of the __name1__ too
for __name1__ to be rejoined to the __name2__ there has to be a referendum in the __name2__ aswell , it 's always been part of the peace process .
it 's a secondary referendum though , only held if __name1__ votes for unity .
it 's also not __value1__ % guaranteed that the __name1__ would vote in favour of reunification given all the trouble it could cause ; economically i do n't think it 'd be too tough , it 's not east germany we 're talking about here but politically it 'd be a nightmare .
i think the city name in my location gives it away , or do you not know where " __name1__ " is ?
of course i 'm a new __name1__ supporter , i 'm not even 25 .
i can n't comment on whether i'd 've voted for them during the __name1__ as i was only born near the end .
least i can remember it .
personally , given me uncle marches in the __name1__ and i 've lost family members to the ' __name2__ , it 's bad enough , to my family , that i support them now .
i 've always wanted a united __name1__ , though , all my life .
that 's interesting , so you are a __name3__ background , __name2__ @-@ __name2__ __name1__ supporter ?
nah , it 'll be the __name1__ if __name2__ left .
__name1__ has never been the __name2__ .
yeah i know it was just the kingdom of great britain before __name1__ joined , but i doubt they 'd change the name back to that if __name2__ left .
it would be easier to keep it as the __name1__ .
the name would still make sense considering it 's still the union of the former kingdoms of __name1__ and __name2__ .
calling it the __name1__ would probably fall out of use eventually , but that would happen gradually .
__value1__ href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibt4zwy6lm4"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibt4zwy6lm4 </a>
why do you keep talking like you 're some __quant1__ year old , experienced __name1__ man , who endured all this hardship and oppression ?
you 're a teenager behind a computer screen ffs .
i do n't think i talk like that tbh . i have learned a lot off many people with first hand experience .
do n't give me that " behind a computer " crap if you do n't know me in real life .
let me guess , you 're __quant1__ @/@ __quant2__ years old who happens to know a few older men who were involved with the __name1__ @/@ __name2__ and are feeding you a romanticised , one sided version of events .
you 've become overawed by all this bull**** romanticism and propaganda instead of using your brain , the sort of chap who sings " go on home __name1__ soliders " when are no british soldiers on patrol in __name2__ .
you 're being used - if you keep going like this it 's likely you 'll end up a member of the __name1__ or __name2__ , cannon fodder for extremists .
wise up and snap out of it .
that post barley warrants a reply .
comic gold .
i think most people are looking at this , again , without an objective analysis of the situation .
ever since the intervention in __name3__ and drone attacks of __name4__ , can anyone give me a successful attack by al @-@ __name1__ on the __name2__ since the intervention ?
some people should know better that the __name1__ and her allies are not on some mission to kill innocent civilians , quite the contrary .
most of the contributions in this topic have failed to recognize that __name1__ fundamentalists have been operating in __name2__ and are the root cause of terrorism in that area .
in __year1__ , __name1__ saw __quant1__ terrorist attacks leaving __quant2__ people dead .
in __year1__ , __name1__ saw __quant1__ terrorist attacks , resulting in __quant2__ casualties .
in __year1__ , __name1__ saw __quant1__ terrorists attacks , resulting in __quant2__ casualties .
in __year1__ , __name1__ saw __quant1__ terrorist attacks , that resulted in __quant2__ fatalities .
terrorist attacks have killed over 35,000 people .
if we compare this to figure of civilian casualties ( which i will go into ) it is quite a healthy ratio as of the 1658 to 2597 killed , __quant1__ were thought to be civilians , in contrast of the __name1__ @/@ al @-@ __name2__ 's operations to kill civilians .
from a strategy perspective , in __year1__ and __year2__ , air drones were equipped with new missiles called small smart weapon ( ssw ) or typically known as ' scorpion .
' these missiles have increased accuracy and expanded surveillance , including the use of small , unarmed surveillance drones to pinpoint the exact location of targets .
ever since the introduction of civilian causality countermeasure technology , __name1__ reports that __quant1__ militants were killed and only __quant2__ civilians killed in drone attacks in mid @-@ __year1__ .
the __name1__ believes that civilian casaulties have decreased from __value1__ % to an estimated __value2__ % , with a total of __quant1__ civilians killed since __month1__ __year1__ .
__value1__ href="http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb/22/world/la-fg-drone-strikes-20110222"> http://articles.latimes.com/2011/feb...rikes-20110222 </a>
on the grounds of legality , according to the __name1__ , members of regular armed forces – involved in conflicts – are the only persons who may be considered lawful combatants and authorised to use lethal force .
the operators in __name1__ are the __name2__ ( __name3__ ) and the pakistani military .
so , who really murders more ?
__name1__ fundamentalist groups total of __quant1__ casualties ( since __year1__ ) or the __name2__ ' __quant2__ casualties ( since __year2__ )?
hmm the real figure of civilian drone death is unkown .
its likely to be much larger than the figure you 've quoted .
who cares ?
if it is __quant1__ , __quant1__ innocent people have died for no reason .
if a guy went and blew up __quant2__ people in __name1__ right now it would be on the news for months , and we 'd be reminded of it for the next __quant1__ years .
why the double standards ?
it 's not double standards , there 's just an opportunity to save more lives albeit , at the expense of a few .
you have to negate the individual if it benefits society as a whole .
i 'm not saying it 's right , but it 's the realistic and only solution to an eroding problem in the __name1__ .
__value1__ % means that a disproportionately small number of terrorist attacks were carried out by __name1__ .
secondly , __name1__ @/@ __name1__ is not the worst thing to ever happen in history .
of course it was utterly disgraceful , disgusting and wrong , but worse things have happened .
perhaps it was the most devastating terrorist attack in __name1__ , but the ones that trail behind it were mostly carried out by non @-@ muslims .
secondly , and more importantly , for every american death at the hands of terrorists , even if you want to include non @-@ muslim ones ( ie the majority ) , there must be thousands of deaths that __name1__ has inflicted in other countries .
though attacks on __name1__ are not justified by this , it would be foolish to think that such aggression would not have repercussions .
and so what , was going to war worth __name1__ having access to him directly ?
considering that if they had of just accepted indirect access , __name1__ @/@ __name1__ would never have happened ?
i agree __name1__ has inflicted hundreds of ' __name2__ ' so to speak .
in the last half century __name1__ has invaded __quant1__ countries .
dropped nukes .
vietnham too just pour __name1__ and other such chemicals without a care into the woods .
how many civillians died there ?
the amount the __name1__ killed in that country is way more than anything __name2__ terrorists have done .
whose the real big baddy terrorist eh ?
i think we all know .
__name1__ , zionists really do n't give a **** about human life do they ?
innocent people are dying and you talk ****.
what ?
thank you .
why can n't people think the same thing ?
if it was __quant1__ __name1__ kids dad there would be media furore .
i did n't see these __quant1__ kids names on the news ?
yet we see soldiers who made a choice to go and fight on the news when they die .
that 's because they are our soldiers and our fellow citizens .
we are n't the ones who want to oppress fellow countrymen and use civilians as shields , while planning new ways to kill __name1__ .
sure , these deaths are n't great , but only a very small minority are caused by us .
most of the killings in the __name2__ @-@ __name2__ are __name1__ killing __name1__ .
you can n't pin the blame on us .
right ....
does that means its okay to kill some innocent civillians ?
i mean __name1__ lives are more valuable than those of oriental weirdos right ?
give me a break man ...
a merican __name1__ drone strikes are whats creating terrorism .
__name1__ intervention , illegal intervention i hasten to add is whats creating terrorism .
if i was that guys brother i would feel so so angry ....
bull****.
what caused the __name1__ embassy bombings ?
you pick __quant1__ singular event , im talking about several events here .
the primary cause is __name1__ foreign policy .
oh so right when the __name1__ use human shields thats fine ?
haha palestinians , how bout the __quant1__ dead in the __name1__ lmao .
you sicken me .
hmm , so where is your evidence of this ?
who reported these stats ?
also , why do i ' sicken ' you ?
do n't want to see the truth , huh ?
i do n't know where you got your evidence for " very few civilians " because the current death toll says otherwise .
what makes you think dropping random bombs is killing specifically __name1__ terrorists , wipe out everyone and you 'll get them too ?
is that the plan ?
they are n't random attacks .
bearing in mind the __name1__ has been free from terrorist attacks for ages , and that __name2__ @/@ __name2__ itself was clearly not executed by a few guys sitting in a cave on the other side of the world .
__value1__ href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzeva8bcobw"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzeva8bcobw </a>
ah , what good is a __name1__ bashing thread without a conspiracy theory ?
you make me laugh , twoofer .
all the evidence points to __name1__ @/@ __name1__ being a terrorist attack and that __name2__ video has been debunked multiple times .
those engineers simply crave attention .
__quant1__ thing we can be sure of though is that when the __name1__ does finally stop attacking , they are going to get a taste of their own medicine eventually , because the damage they 've caused is irreversible .
they 've brought it upon themselves by being so power hungry and attracted to oil like a moth to a flame .
oh right , so you are suggesting we keep this up indefinitely ?
do you know how much these wars are costing us ?
also , these wars having nothing to do with oil .
we actually got less oil out of __name1__ after the war and what oil is there in __name2__ ?
so they made up the foreign policy stuff to hide their true agenda which is the hatred of the __name1__ way of life and of the world 's existence ! !!
they are run by dr __name1__ himself with his __name1__ plot to destroy the world ! !!!!!
this is the real world not your stupid fictional film where evil geniuses exist and want to destroy everything .
everything he said is factually correct .
all of al @-@ __name1__ 's actions against __name2__ have been justified by them on the basis of propagating __name3__ .
and you just use a bunch of exclamation marks and a __name1__ character , and do n't even deal with the facts he cited .
problem is , were those drone strikes to stop you would have far more attempted terrorist attacks .
the collateral is horrible yes but if they stop __name1__ and these other groups are n't going to say well that was very nice of __name2__ shall we all go home ?
calling deaths " collateral damage " is stupid .
lol , evidence ?
are you ****ing kidding me , google it mate .
thats why you sicken me ...
you live in a bubble .
the bombing of the embassies started before __name1__ " invaded __name2__ lands " ( whatever the hell that means ) .
these radical wahhabis hate the entire world , and even if we stopped and withdrew all troops tomorrow , they would continue to attack us regardless of foreign policy .
the only way to deal with such people is to arrange an appointment for them with their maker .
i 'm living in a bubble ?
you are the one who takes all this ' poor palestinians being treated like scum ' bs spewed by liberals .
stop making stuff up and grow a brain .
at least most __name1__ are sane , unlike the __name2__ goverment who just can n't seem to stop committing terrorist acts .
ah , this explains the __quant1__ suicide bombings in beautiful countries like __name1__
hmm thats because maybe they are ...
whats your definition of being treated like scum ?
hmm mine is :
1 . having your land split into lots of little pieces .
so much so that you have to go to another country to get to parts of your own country .
2 . having even more of your partitioned land being taken for you .
3 . to make things worse have a wall being put in your land .
and your entry @/@ exit out of this wall is controlled .
like a concentration camp in the __name1__ ...
easily forgotten right ?
quick to remember it when you want to .
4 . having white phosphorous bombs chucked on you .
5 . having a blockade imposed on me .
they are being treated like scum you ****ing idiot .
once again we are a country of over 60 million , less than a million protested in this country .
now you may not be so good at maths , but i'mn sure even you can realise that the protesters were nowhere near the majority .
so the number of protesters determine whether or not they were against the war ?
what about the pensioners who could n't get out of bed or the disabled ?
what about the mothers who wanted to protect their kids if the protest turned violent ?
what about the men who had to work on that day to feed their families ?
what about the people who had the desire to protest but could n't due to prior family engagements ?
what about the people who are not allowed to protest ?
once again , there is no excuse for terrorism .
not to mention y'know , that the anti @-@ war protesters were n't the ones that flew planes into buildings beforehand ...
so ?
it was the anti @-@ imperialist .
no one listened to them and they resorted to terrorism .
look at __name1__ where the __name2__ tried to enforce their rule upon others .
and yes , the world is n't great .
but what you gunna do ?
do you want me to do something ?
what ' actual ' perpetrators of attacks on __name1__ ?
nationalist attacks are incredibly rare and most of them are things like carbombs with hours of warning ( aside from __name1__ this year ) .
fundamentalist __name1__ attacks are designed to kill as many people as possible , nationalist @/@ seperatist attacks generally are n't .
they 're entirely different things .
i 've never heard of a nationalist suicide bomber .
comparing the two and suggesting that nationalist @/@ seperatist attacks are more dangerous is ridiculous , try comparing the death tolls caused by __name1__ in the last __quant1__ years compared to __quant2__ attack in __name3__ by __name2__ fundamentalists .
even the __name1__ failed to cause as many casualties on mainland __name2__ as __name3__ trained suicide bombers did in __quant1__ day .
so you chucked the statistics out of the window by claiming " nationalist attacks are rare "?
at this point , i would like to mention that although nationalist attacks maybe rare , they nevertheless are __value1__ % more then __name1__ bombings .
does giving " hours of warning " make the act a bit more humane ?
it sounds like you support terrorist attacks , but with just a tiny weeny bit of warning beforehand .
suicide bombing - well , they see it as a more effective tool .
they want maximum casualties and the way to go about achieving that is through suicide bombing .
the attacks are going on in __name1__ because __name1__ can n't be trusted to deal with the __name2__ @-@ __name2__ @/@ __name3__ operatives in their country via their legal system .
if __name1__ actually wanted to co @-@ operate and help the fight against these guys then the drone attacks would n't be needed .
instead __name1__ is still obsessed with it 's age old conflict with __name2__ and believes it needs to control __name3__ to prevent india getting a foothold , thus it constantly funds and trains the same people it 's telling __name4__ it 's fighting .
well , maybe people are sympathetic to the cause of __name1__ .
people will do what they want to do .
watch ' __name1__ ' on the __name4__ __name3__ , it 's an awesome __quant1__ part documentary about how __name2__ has been supporting and funding these people for __quant2__ .
are you telling me that if __name2__ invaded , occupied and slaughtered people of __name3__ , residents of wales/scotland/northern __name1__ would not support and fund the english to get rid of the occupying force by any means necessary , not limited to suicide bombings ?
and the __quant1__ other able bodied people , who make up the vast majority , we should ignore them precisely because they are the majority ?
in __name1__ , despite how i despise the __name2__ , i can say surely that they did not intentionally try to kill as many civilians as possible , they did n't execute teachers who taught girls , they did n't whip people for not growing beards etc. i never agree with terrorism , but to put the __name3__ on the same level as __name4__ or __name5__ insurjents just showcases your ignorance .
and if what you do is legal , then feel free to .
if you feel the urge to blow **** up , then kindly bog off to the __name1__ where you wont affect britian .
ta .
__name1__
-- i 'm sorry what ?
why ?
__name1__
-- the __name1__ government is ultra capitalist but it does not terrorize people at the level of invasion .
__name1__
-- __name2__ is just an __name1__ nationalist .
the country is a dictatorship but contrary to thought almost all __name1__ countries are independent of there government .
life goes on regardless - the level of infrastructure is too weak , they have n't developed in the right way .
++ the only reason people dislike zimbabwe is because he exiled the white people from __name1__ and ceased there land .
yeman
-- __name1__ is poor and run by an oligarchy , invade and you 'll leave with more people and more western sympathetic oligarchy .
what have you done but wast ammunition and reduce oil prices for about __quant1__ years ( to piss of __name1__ ) .
__name1__
-- o no , the __name1__ killed some violent protesters .
lets destroy the government and solve things ! !
invading a place does n't magically create human rights , democracy and wealth .
that 's a myth propagated to the citizenry to justify wars in the interest of the government invading .
we live under the we you do because people starve and suffer elsewhere - such is the nature of he world .
inevitable poverty .
my arguement was merely that we cannot intervene in every country where there exists instability and corruption .
why do n't we intervene in __name1__ ?
the same reasons we have n't intervened in many other countries who 's leaders exercise ruthless power over their citizens .
we did n't intervene when the __name1__ lankan government were slaughtering the __name2__ , or during the __name3__ genocide , or when the yemen/syrian/bahrain government shot at their protesters , or when __name4__ began killing opposition .
these are only recent events .
countless over atrocities have taken place without our intervention .
__name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ ...
to name but a few .
clearly i may be wrong , feel more than welcome to correct me .
that does n't mean that they do n't benefit from the intervention .
how do they benefit from it ?
having our companies lose __quant1__ on oil fields that they cannot use ?
on the various countries being cut off from the oil ?
on having to spend __quant1__ on a no fly zone ?
__name1__ is as bad , no , i meant worse than __name3__ __name2__ .
aside from the lack of free speech , capitalism and being made to worship the leader , the country has an awfull amount of cruelty .
if an individual complains about his way of life , inadvertently says something bad about __name1__ , or the country , then he , his children and his parents are all taken away to a concentration camp .
<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/04/north-korea-political-prisoners-amnesty"> http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011...soners-amnesty </a>
__name1__ estimates there to be __quant1__ prisoners held in concentration camps for offences like these , there the men , women , children are held indefinetly .
poison gas has been used on inmates , with this shocking report from a defector of him witnessing a new nerve gas being tested on a family whilst scientists observe from above .
__value1__ href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/feb/01/northkorea"> http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/feb/01/northkorea </a>
public executions are also done regularly , and barbed wire fences , land mines and anti @-@ aircraft defences guard the compounds , as this report shows <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3071466/ns/us_news-only_on_msnbccom/t/death-terror-n-korea-gulag/"> http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3071466/...n-korea-gulag/ </a>

so why did we interven in __name2__ __name1__ in __year1__ , and in __name3__ __year2__ , but not in __name4__ __year3__ ?
__name1__ intervened during the __name2__ ...
it led to the current situation .
__name1__ ceased to fight because it would have been tantamount to aggression against __name2__ , whom border __name3__ .
__name1__ would in no way appreciate any new aggression because they prefer to have a dilapidated __name2__ state on their doorstep when the alternative is something like __name4__ , which is capitalistic , extremely pro @-@ __name3__ and essentially the antithesis of chinese culture ; and would therefore probably alter chinese culture , or demonstrate the temptations of capitalism to its people .
try not to think in such a simplistic and imperialistic way ; we have no right to go attacking states we disapprove of , and in this instance as i have hopefully shown , it would be extremely impractical .
anyway , __name1__ will most likely self destruct in the next decade or so .
__name1__ does have oil as well as gold and coal
not that i 've heard of ...
then do some research
i do n't disagree .
__name1__ minister lose there most hated foreign enemy .
one oil rich vassal state .
( this is a bonus , not a motive ) · one __name1__ country that was actually in growth goes back into decline .
one less dictator .
i 'm actually happy he 's beating them off .
i watch __name1__ news every afternoon ( cable ) and things are going well .
-- __name1__ took down the __value1__ major power station and there was a government victory demonstration in __name2__ .
hmm..
i do n't know how i feel about this .
i do n't really know enough to have a solid opinion but i do think that the __name1__ resolution was absolute rubbish & __name2__ has been nothing but a joke .
i do n't support __name1__ at all but it 's clear that neither side could n't care less about civilians getting killed .
another thing , i do n't think we hear much about ^ on the news either , they 're too selective over what they tell us
according to the __name1__ website they do n't .
they are __value1__ th supplier in the world .
hardly major .
__name1__ talked about the war in __name2__ and how cruel it was how many people were mutilated and so on , now __name3__ is waging war against __name4__ , all people see is how he is black .
am i the only one who sees he is crooked and a war mongerer like __name1__ and __name2__ .
he also denies __name1__ statehood , he is no change !
the picture sums him up completely .
forgetting that __name1__ killed and hated people of __name2__ @/@ and __name3__ origin .
i do n't think having the authority of the __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ transnational __name3__ and __name4__ .
compares fairly with __name2__ and __name3__ 's adventures in __name1__ .
but oh well , no amount of rational discussion will convince you anyway .
the international community demanded action and in response __name1__ sought international backing and got it .
if he had not responded and thousands of more __name1__ people were slaughtered you 'd be making a thread attacking him for letting innocent people die and not giving a damn .
he can n't win with people like you .
please propose a different solution to stopping tyrannical leaders from slaughtering their citizens indiscriminately .
do we send them a __name1__ message to surrender ?
do we make ' important ' threads on __name1__ decrying their actions ?
what do we do exactly ?
watch and wait for ...
what ?
after every national , supranational and international spokesperson has demanded cease fire and for the civilians to be left alone in peace .
what the hell do we do next ?
add them on __name1__ ?
it was up to the __name1__ to stop the dictator , not war mongering __name2__ .
that is what revolution is .
ah so your solution is for the international community to watch massacres take place and if you have the will to stop it , just do nothing .
amazing .
thank you for ignoring the fact that __name1__ got permission from the __name2__ and __name3__ .
even refusing to take action until it had done so .
because of course this would n't fit your anti __name1__ agenda .
you speak like the isreali foreign minister .
try to see it from the other side too .
i try - but it 's not a simple good vs bad story by any means .
many countries were uneasy about the decision , even __name1__ and __name2__ and their human rights record speaks for itself .
the __name1__ had little time to make a decision , basically the __name1__ should of allowed the rebels to take control on their own .
not any intervention , i knew it would of cost more lives and it did .
he kills people , end of .
he has blood on his hands like __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ .
give me __quant1__ major world leader who does n't have blood on their hands ?
part of the job really ...
__name1__
you have no evidence to prove that if the international community did not intervene it would have prevented more civilian deaths .
stop acting as if you have a magical crystal ball . , because you do n't .
people can only judge the situation and weigh up the consequences of action and inaction .
you thought it was perfectly okay for the world to not take action , that 's your view but not mine .
have any view you like .
i agree with you , but this is more complicated than that .
__name1__
he still authorised __name1__ , that failed and ended up with the deaths of __name2__ soldiers .
plus , this fails to mention any covert operations which we are not in public knowledge .
no , racism does n't exist anymore and , if anything , the recent downturn has brought people together for support
what ? !
you mad ?
it exists .
if it did n't their would n't be racial attacks .
only recently in the news a __name1__ man in the __name2__ ( loads of cases ) was called " pa**" and stabbed to death .
has anyone had any personal experiences of an increase in racial tensions at all ?
i was brought up in a racist household , personal experiences yes , totally , every time i 've ever been in trouble or confrontation it 's been either that of the black @/@ asian race .
do you see the __name1__ increasing their portion of the vote in the next general election ?
i hope so .
people think racism works only __quant1__ way eg .
whites being racist .
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/crime/8850704/white-man-subjected-to-race-attack-by-gang-of-yobs.html"> http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/ukne...g-of-yobs.html </a>
white man subjected to race attack by gang of yobs · andrew goodram , __quant1__ , suffered a punctured lung and __quant2__ broken ribs after the gang of __quant3__ yobs shouted : " white bastard " at him before subjecting him to a vicious assault .
during the beating mr goodram , a labourer , was repeatedly kicked in the head , face and body .
__quant1__ of his attackers then stood over him and stamped on his chest causing was police described as " significant injuries ."
the assault at __name1__ in __name2__ , __name3__ was called off when __quant1__ of the thugs said they should leave and they all ran off in different directions .
mr goodram , a father of __quant1__ managed to stagger home after the assault where he alerted relatives .
he spent __quant1__ days in hospital .
today @/@ yesterday as __name1__ confirmed the attack at 7 pm on __month1__ __time1__ was being treated as a racially motivated incident mr goodram who has __quant1__ sons said : " i was in such terrible pain after the attack , i was yelping and my eyes were watering .
related articles
" i 'm scared now and when i see groups of __name1__ people and this attack has changed how i feel about going out .
" when i 'm walking around especially on my own i feel intimidated and worried i might get attacked again .
the fact is i am not racist and i have got loads of __name1__ friends and i 'm really saddened that this has happened to me .
i do believe the attack was racially motivated because i am white but i do n't understand why . i thought we are supposed to live together in peace .
the incident occurred after mr goodram was taking a shortcut through the park when he encountered the group of __quant1__ __name1__ men - who were with __quant2__ friends .
as he walked past them __quant1__ said : " what did you say you white bastard ?
" before launching an attack .
mr goodram added : " __quant1__ carried on walking and put my hood up and ignored them , but then they jumped me and __quant1__ was pulled to the ground.they were kicking me and hitting me and __quant1__ of them twisted my arm behind my back .
" __quant1__ of them jumped on me and , when __quant1__ winced in pain , they ran off ."
the attackers were __name1__ and aged between __quant1__ and __quant2__ .
__quant1__ of the men has been described as __name1__ , in his early __quant2__ s , __quant3__ ft __quant4__ in , of heavy build , with a bald head and a thin ' lined ' type beard .
he was wearing a dark hooded top with tracksuit bottoms and wore white __name1__ training shoes .
mr goodram was unable to describe the other members of the group .
police confirmed they were searching for __quant1__ men over the assault .
a spokesman said : " the victim was walking through the park at about 7 pm when he was attacked by a group of __name1__ men .
the man was repeatedly kicked in the head , face and body , __quant1__ of the men stood over him and stamped on his chest causing significant injuries .
racist abuse was shouted at the man before the attack .
" __quant1__ man in the group shouted for them to leave and they all ran off in different directions .
the victim has bruising to the face , head and body .
he has __quant1__ broken ribs and a punctured lung .
a group of __quant1__ men are wanted for the assault ."
and this is the benefits of living with **** & piss in your community .
the historical cliche is that as the economy suffers , so politics becomes polarised and people begin to search for irrational explanations for the cause of their misery ; people need someone to blame .
__name2__ __name1__ is often given as the shining example of this - " it 's the __name3__ !
blame the __name1__ ! "
there are obviously many important differences between __decade1__ s __name1__ and __century1__ st century __name2__ .
- __name1__ was raped far , far harder than __name2__ has been ; · - the welfare state was completely falling apart leaving people facing homelessness and genuinely terrifying living standards ; · - unemployment was something ridiculous like 8 million ; · - we 're arguably far more tolerant ( some would say too tolerant ) and educated than 70+ years ago ; · - __name3__ has gone from being a genuine threat to your life in in __name4__ , to being reserved for __name5__ films and textbooks today ; · - we have a far more stable government ; · - we have n't lived through a horrifying bloodbath of a war ; · - other stuff i have n't though about .
has history repeated itself in any respect do you think ?
i do n't really know so that 's why i started this thread .
i have noticed a lot of implicit and explicit racism on __name1__ from a vocal minority but i wonder if that 's just always been there .
i mean , have n't the __name1__ and its readers been lambasting immigrants since the dawn of time ?
is there anyone reading this who will consider voting __name1__ when they would n't have done so before ?
just wanted to hear some thoughts on what others think .
particularly the economic downturn 's wider historical significance .
__name1__ and the __name2__ are still far more prosperous now than they were in the __decade1__ s .
unemployment levels are not as severe and there is still welfare protection unlike in the __decade1__ s .
also , the overall demographic of migrants in __name1__ today is overwhelmingly young , male , and competitive .
the indigenous __name1__ population is more skewed towards the older ( and female ) demographic .
thus the __name1__ are more likely to moan and groan than resort to violence and aggression ( predominantly a young and male trait ) .
also , significant proportions of the __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ male population in major __name1__ cities are migrant men .
i sense some satirical irony in this .
wot irony ?
wot dya mean
i would agree , especially when its comes to the jobs situation .
dey took our jerbs ! !!
well , to an extent they did .
certainly immigration has increased competition , especially for low @-@ paid , low @-@ skilled work , and the reciprocal benefits have largely been taken advantage of by well @-@ educated white @-@ collar workers who have had more opportunities to develop themselves and learn multiple languages .
i 'm all for a bit of protectionism when it comes to labour markets .
1 ) yeah that 's what i said .
2 ) interesting point that i have n't considered before .
yeah , that 's a horrible and malicious attack which can n't be condoned on any level .
but do you think it 's fair to imply that all __name1__ and blacks subject whites to racist attacks ?
are all white __name1__ members of the __name2__ ?
are all __name2__ __name1__ ?
absolutely right !
what ? !
the news has a tendency to exaggerate to catch your attention
i shall rephrase my last comment , there 's no racism with intelligent people in our society
if you know someone who is racist then either do something about it if you can or ignore them , not worth your time
yes i think so .
i remember basically being made redundant and my boyfriend as well , being told there are no more hours for us where we worked , so it is best to just resign and look elsewhere .
in the week we were leaving about 4 new __name1__ people were being hired in the same area that we were and them constantly being given overtime , which was a little strange .
they were all friends of the __name1__ manageress .
luckily , me and the bf lived with __name1__ people at the time and he is foreign himself , but i can see how to someone else going through that how it would really irritate them and start shifting their mindset towards immigrants and stuff .
originally posted by andy the anarchist · for a start , do you really think that the main reason people are poor is because they are lazy ?
many people are n't poor because they 're lazy , they 're poor because they had poor educational opportunities , or because they lack some of the talents required for a high salary , such as having a high intellect or strong people skills .
more to the point , many people have disabilities or long term illnesses which harm their earning prospects .
and some people are just unlucky , and end up with damaged prospects through no fault of their own ( say if someone was born into a broken family with drug and alcohol problems , and ended up without the level of parental support required to succeed in education and then the workplace ) .
all of these things limit earning capacity , making people poor for reasons not of their own making .
to then penalise these people by potentially allowing them to die if they become ill seems to me to be cruel and heartless beyond measure .
considering the low levels of social mobility in this country , and the increasing correlation between parental income and one 's own income , you 'd think that people might realise that some people are born with more social advantages than others , and thus can cope with misfortune more easily than others , say the cost of a major operation .
i absolutely agree with you on the subject @- what __name1__ fail to realise that there are are diseases that do not discriminate between poor and rich .
besides , certain health conditions and injuries affect long term employment prospects , so some people get caught in a vicious circle @- they can n't work because they can n't afford treatment , and they can n't afford treatment because they do n't work .
when my father has injured his hand in an accident , he received all the medical help he needed , hence his hand healed properly and he can work , contributing to the economy .
if we lived in __name1__ , he would either be crippled or still paying off his debt @- thank __name2__ we are not american .
there 's only a big fuss in the __name1__ because the insurance companies are trying to protect their monopoly .
how many __name1__ get campaign contributions from the insurance companies ?
money is a good motivation to lie .
it surprises me how selfish and utterly uncaring some people can be .
it reminds me of the story where a community decides to hire a private security force in their area , they then realise that they do n't really need the police anymore and so lobby to reduce taxes going towards police .
they are rich and powerful in politics so taxes are cut .
their community thrives but the community down the road slips into chaos as the police can n't grapple with the crime due to the cuts .
the richer community then points to the poorer community and says well if you were n't lazy and controlled crime you could improve your area , get more business and money then you might be able to hire a security force yourself .
ironic when the high crime slum is a product of the richer communities greed .
yes , there are people that are on benefits for a reason , such as being made redundant , disabilities etc. the people i am talking about are those who choose not to work because they would rather do nothing and get free money .
dont tell me they do not exist , because i know a few of them myself .
as for the other reasons such as low education and poor opportunity .
i think you are indirectly insulting those with lesser intelligence than you consider adequate to get a " decent " job .
my father could not read or write when he left school and still has problems with both even now .
he has worked his arse off all his life and has always payed his taxes .
he is a plasterer , which i admit is not the most glamorous of trades , and i started life being quite poor .
however , my father always payed his taxes and national insurance and has worked his way up to being the best , and most well payed tradesman in the area .
since he started life with a lot more misfortune than most , and has still managed to pay his way and provide for his family , why cant everyone else ?
originally posted by richard_a_garner · no it does n't .
removing the idea that food is dependent on ability to pay led to mass starvation in the __name1__ .
why would n't it mean the same when it is health care rather than food ?
the __name1__ led to immediate rationing , the long term effect of which has been that rich people opt out , and poor people die on waiting lists .
on a market economy , if people want more of a and less of b , demand for a will go up and demand for b will fall .
sales of a will increase , and slaes of b will decrease , meaning more profits providing a and less providing b. this also means that providers of a will be able to raise their prices without losing sales , and supplies of b will have to drop theirs to keep sales .
the raising prices and profits in the a industry will attract new suppliers into the industry , possibly from the b industry , where falling prices and profits are encouraging people to leave .
the net result is that production of b declines and production of a rises .
so the price mechanism allows those that want more of a to tell people to provide more of it , whilst giving them a proportionate incentive to respond appropriately , and allows people who want less of b to tell providers of b to produce less of it , and gives them a proportionate incentive to respond appropriately .
moreover , the same works for factors of production : how would land owners know that people wanted more bread , for instance ?
the price and profit in the bread industry would rise as demand rises , telling bread makers to make more bread , or other producers to become bread makers .
this causes a rise in the demand for wheat , with the same effect .
this causes a rise in the demand for land , with the same effect .
abolishing , or interfering with this price mechanism , by fixing prices at __quant1__ , prevents this signalling process from happening .
consumers cannot signal to suppliers that more of one thing is needed and less of another , nor provide them with a proportionate incentive to respond .
whether or not health care proffessionals are in it for the money or for the basic desire to help , they cannot know which service people want more of .
fixing the price at __quant1__ means that demand will be higher than it would other wise be , that people will seek to get healthcare worth less to them than it costs to provide - the textbook definition of " over supplying ."
the result of the whole debacle will be chronic shortages and missalocation of resources , coupled with special interest politics that will lead the __name1__ to be run for the benefit of those that work in it rather than those that use it .
no it is n't .
it is based on the idea that if you want something , you are entitled to go out and force people to give you money for it .
if i went around taxing people , i would be arrested for robbery or extortion .
but this is what people want the state to do to fund the __name1__ . it is based on the idea that people do n't own themselves but should have to pay the state if they want to use their own body and mind to produce a living for themselves , so long as the state uses this money to buy everybody healthcare .
it is based on the idea that it is ok to sacrifice one person to another .
of course it is __name1__ : it is collectively owned , not run for a profit , outside the market , supplying , in theory , " to each according to need ."
your comparison with food manufacture is flawed and misleading .
the __name1__ does not prevent patient choice ( one can choose to go private if preferred ) it simply means the patient does n't need to pay for that choice .
the idea that this diminishes the practice of supply and demand is false ; you cannot draw parallels between food consumption and healthcare , they are fundamentally different .
your argument that the __name1__ is based " on the idea that it is ok to sacrifice one person to another " and " that if you want something , you are entitled to go out and force people to give you money for it " is frankly , wrong .
you show negligible knowledge regarding taxation .
most people would accept that taxation is needed to secure the stability of the country , and to implement initiatives that cannot be brought about by the individual or by small parties and which require broader application by the state to be most effective .
therefore the state is not ' robbing ' us ; the taxpayer concedes that in the interests of good service , the healthcare system cannot be fragmented and subject to condition .
the __name1__ was the product of liberal thinking ; it is not necessarily ' __name2__ '.
i am happy with the evil and orwellian __name1__ thanks :-)
regarding illnesses for which one is not to blame ; the question should not be " this is n't my fault , why should i have to pay ? "
but rather , " this is n't anyone else 's fault , why should they have to pay ? "
i 've brought this up in other forums ( __name1__ ) , and i 'll bring it up here .
anyone interested in the __name1__ , bigfoot , skunk ape , yeti , and so on should check out the books by tom brown jr. (' the tracker ', ' __name2__ 's field guide to wilderness survival ', ' grandfather ', ' the quest ', and so on ) .
this guy was , apparantly , trained in the arcane arts of psychological and guerilla warfare by an __name1__ scout named stalking wolf .
many of the sightings of the __name1__ in the sixties can be blamed on him and his friend rick--some __name2__ have a tradition of counting coup , which sometimes involves the theft of an intimate item and , basically , terrifying the living **** out of your enemy without killing him .
there are many secret societies that have existed in history .
the __name1__ of __name2__ university has members like __name4__ ( jr . and sr.) , the __name3__ of __name5__ , and the various ninja organizations of fuedal __name6__ qualify .
i find it interesting that many sightings of strange creatures occur near tribal lands .
it would n't surprise me if there were some __name1__ traditions have survived .
all the best ,
---kevin
good observation kevin ...
i would n't be surprised if an important part of those " __name1__ traditions ...
if they exist of course..
did n't include keeping quiet ( at least beyond the inner circle ) about any such ' coup counting ' that took place ...
me ?
no.
but a man i work with grew up in the __name1__ , and says that , when he was young , he saw something which he could n't identify , but which he can n't think of anything else it could be but a bigfoot/sasquatch/whatever .
he was climbing a tree when he smelled something " like a wet dog on fire ."
he looked around and there was something tall and furry facing him .
he fell out of the tree and ran home .
he says he knows it was n't a bear , even though he could n't see it clearly through the branches .
just another anecdote .
originally posted by huntster · sure .
a heavy person with a foot approximately __quant1__ " long and a very long stride could have been walking about barefoot at least __quant2__ miles from the nearest road in the southern __name1__ range , and instead of walking along the trail , he @/@ she crossed it by walking @/@ sliding down a rockslide , through the bushes on a faint game trail , and through mud and water .
it 's also possible that a huge bear ( with rear footprints larger than i 've ever seen in __name1__ , including __name2__ , and without any sign of clawmarks ) was walking bipedally ( there was no evidence whatsoever of a front pawprint ) .
it 's also possible that a human walked those __quant1__ miles up that particular , lonely trail , carrying bigfoot " sandals " in order to fool any hikers that might possibly happen by , and that we never saw that person before , during , or after the trackway find .
i suppose it 's also possible that the trackway was left by a biological being other than a sasquatch ( though i can n't imagine what that might be ) , or an extraterrestrial being .
or , the prints might have been left by a ( no !
no !
do n't write it !
it cannont be ! ) sasquatch .
after considering the possiblilties , i 've concluded that it was likely a sasquatch .
its also possible that your statement does not report reality .
since we were not there , we cannot validate that ...
from your perspective , that is true .
i was writing from my perspective .
however , absence of corroborative evidence tends to suggest that bf does not exist / is a bloke in a suit .
in my case , yes .
the absence of corroborative evidence suggests that my claim is unsubstantiated .
however , other sasquatch evidence does have corroborating evidence , and it is also rejected by some on this forum as not even being evidence .
the bottom line is that some folks are satisfied with the evidence available , some want more , and some will never be satisfied without proof .

is this a __name1__ conspiracy theory ?
would such an accusation be racist , or would it just be stupid ?
__name1__ factoids :
the __name6__ is a marshy area on the coastal plain of southeastern __name1__ and northeastern __name2__ between __name3__ , virginia , and __name4__ , __name2__ in the __name5__ .
it is located in parts of southern __name1__ and __name3__ in __name2__ , as well as northern __name4__ , __name6__ , and __name7__ counties in __name5__ .
it is a southern swamp , __quant1__ of many along the __name1__ 's coast which includes the __name2__ and the __name4__ in __name3__ , the __name5__ in __name6__ , the __name7__ and __name9__ swamps of __name8__ , and some of the __name10__ in the carolinas .
along the eastern edge runs the __name1__ , completed in __year1__ .
essential to the swamp ecosystem are its water resources , native vegetative communities , and varied wildlife species .
the __name1__ 's ecological significance and its wealth of history and lore make it a unique wilderness .
it is __quant1__ of the last large and wild areas remaining in the eastern __name1__ .
after centuries of logging and other human activities which were devastating the swamp 's ecosystems , the __name1__ was created in __year1__ when the __name2__ of __name3__ , __name4__ donated __quant1__ acres ( 200 km²) of land ; the refuge was officially established through the dismal swamp act of __year2__ .
the refuge consists of over __quant1__ acres ( 500 km²) of forested wetlands .
__name1__ , a __quant1__ acre ( 13 km²) natural lake , is located in the heart of the swamp .
outside the boundaries of the __name3__ , the state of __name1__ has preserved and protected additional portions of the swamp , as the __name2__ .
scientists believe the __name1__ was created when the continental shelf made its last big shift .
the whole swamp has peat underneath .
the origin of __name1__ , __quant1__ of only __quant2__ natural lakes in __name2__ , is disputed .
scientists believe[citation needed ] the lake could have been created by the impact of a meteoroid because it is oval shaped , looking like the impact of a meteoroid .
they think it was made by a big meteoroid like the ones that are thought to have made the __name1__ .
other people[citation needed ] believe it was made by a large underground peat burn about __quant1__ to __quant2__ years ago .
__name1__ legend talks about " the fire bird " creating __name2__ .
there is archaeological evidence which indicates human occupation began nearly __quant1__ years ago .
while all efforts to drain the swamp ultimately failed , logging of the swamp proved to be a successful commercial activity .
regular logging operations continued as late as __year1__ .
many areas have been burned by periodic wildfires .
the __name1__ has been drastically altered by humanity over the past __quant1__ centuries .
agricultural , commercial , and residential development destroyed much of the swamp , so that the remaining portion within and around the refuge represents less than half of the original size .
before the refuge was established , over __quant1__ miles ( 230 km ) of roads were constructed to provide access to the timber .
these roads severely disrupted the swamp 's natural hydrology , as the ditches which were dug to provide soil for the road beds drained water from the swamp .
the roads also blocked the flow of water across the swamp 's surface , flooding some areas of the swamp with stagnant water .
the logging operations removed natural stands of __name1__ and __name2__ that were replaced by other forest types , particularly __name3__ .
a drier swamp and the suppression of wildfires , which once cleared the land for seed germination , created ecological conditions that were less favorable to the survival of __name1__ stands .
as a result , plant and animal variety decreased .
in the late __decade1__ s , prince corporation heir __name1__ spent part of his inherited wealth to purchase about __quant1__ acres ( 24 km2 ) of the gds to create a " state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art private training ground for shooters and security operators ".
[ 2 ] his private military contracting company—blackwater worldwide—is named for the peat @-@ colored water of the swamp .
also nearby are __name1__ and __name2__ bases and the __name3__ facilities are rented out to various government agencies for swat team training .
the __name1__ is located not only between __quant1__ states , but also between __quant2__ eco @-@ regions , allowing for a wide range of plant and animal species .
baldcypress , __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , and __name4__ are the predominant tree species found on the refuge and support the wildlife within .
many mammal species , including black bear , bobcat , otter , and weasel , along with over 70 species of reptiles and amphibians call the swamp home .
more than 200 bird species can be seen at the swamp throughout the year , while __quant1__ of those are known to nest on the refuge .
__name1__ is the middle of activity in the swamp today with many fishermen , sightseers , and boaters .
camping is not allowed on the refuge but is allowed on the lake drummond reservation ( __name1__ ' site ) which is located at the feeder ditch spillway .
access to this site is by boat only .

wow , good job william and great info on the swamp kk . thanks so much .
wgbh , given your description of this event , which preceded the sighting of the presumed bigfoot , i would like to submit the possibility that you were having a hypnagogic hallucination , which sometimes occur in conjunction with sleep paralysis .
" hypnagogia " is the transitional state between wakefulness and sleep .
a hypnagogic hallucination is a dream that occurs between the __name1__ ( dream-) state and full wakefulness .
such hallucinations can and have been taken as real events in the minds of those who experience them .
sleep paralysis is a condition that sometimes occurs when the brain awakens from the __name1__ ( dream-) state , but body paralysis -- a natural part of the rem state -- persists .
this conscious @-@ yet @-@ paralyzed state is sometimes accompanied by hypnagogic hallucinations and an acute sense of danger and panic .
distorted perceptions of one 's surroundings , and imagined objects or beings , are known and documented elements of these paralyzed hallucinations .
in the above @-@ quoted report , you say you had not eaten that day and that you became weak and debilitated from nausea .
you describe being " frozen ...
stuck there " prior to being " curled up in the fetal position " on the floor of the deer stand " for about __quant1__ minutes ".
this sounds like a description of sleep paralysis .
you also describe being alone in the woods for the __value1__ time in your life .
" sudden environmental change " is a factor that has been reported to increase the likelihood of sleep paralysis occurring .
others include :
* sleeping in a face upwards or supine position · * irregular sleeping schedules ; naps , sleeping in , sleep deprivation · * increased stress · * sudden environmental @/@ lifestyle changes · * a lucid dream that immediately precedes the episode .
wgbh , if you are interested in discovering what happened to you that night in __year1__ , and have an open mind on the subject , i invite you to look into sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations , and decide for yourself if the factors involved with this known and studied , but little understood , phenomenon , match your recollection of the events .
it occurs to me that you might have witnessed a bear from the deer stand and , in your waking dream state , distorted the perception into a bigfoot , of which creature you have said you were aware from television .
the feelings of panic and irrational danger that often accompany sleep paralysis have stuck with you all these years , and have led or contributed to on @-@ going feelings of unease associated with the memory .
from __name3__ : · over the centuries , symptoms of sleep paralysis have been described in many ways and often attributed to " evil " presences : unseen night demons in ancient times , the old hag in __name2__ 's __name1__ , and alien abductors .
almost every culture throughout history has had stories of shadowy evil creatures that terrify helpless humans at night .
people have long sought explanations for this mysterious sleep @-@ time paralysis and the accompanying feelings of terror .
but sleep researchers now know that , in most cases , sleep paralysis is simply a sign that your body is not moving smoothly through the stages of sleep .
rarely is sleep paralysis linked to deep underlying psychiatric problems .
i honestly hope this helps .
here are some quick links to get you started in any research you care to undertake :

note : i 've relied on __name1__ 's entries for the general wording of some of my descriptions of these conditions or phenomena , but the wiki entries are fully corroborated and supported by medical websites ' descriptions and definitions of the terms as well .
also , i 've written an unpublished novel in which the main character experiences sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations .
i mention this to explain how i 've come to understand a little about these events beyond simply looking them up tonight on the internet .
vortigern ,
i am at work this morning .
if i had to make a knee jerk reaction , i would say it was not sleep paralysis .
but i will study the information you provided closer when i get home tonight .
i want to be fair to you and the fine research you put into it , so it does deserve a closer look when i have more time .
thank you so much for your effort .
just wanted to drop out of lurking and thank you guys for this thread .
while these forums see quite a lot of discussions about the bigfoot phenomena it 's very rare to read a first hand eyewitness report .
i have little to add to the discussion though , but felt you it might be a good idea to remind you veterans that you teach us newbies something new every time .
good to see what kind of questions that are asked and what answers that are available .
i can see why so many exotic explanations crop up to explain the elusive nature of the creature .
it 's a very troubling paradox for the eyewitnesses that they see something that they are sure is there , but is night impossible to explain rationally .
how can such a large creature , apparently seen by quite a few people in the __name1__ , somehow withstand every attempt to gather clear evidence for it 's existance ?
i can understand why such an experience would be though to deal with .
xblade ,
i am not going to answer condescending questions from people who accuse me of embellissing .
been there , done that .
yawn .
excuse making from another footer .
just curious , can bigfoot fly in the latest version of your story ?
i 've actually had a situation like that in the late __decade1__ s , and my observations would be that during the actual episode , it was vividly real , i would attribute mine in that moment to what you would hear described in a haunting , but upon awakening , just me , nevermore .
not that that is what happened with jc , just adding for a personal perspective .
i tried to get them to come with me when i went to inspect the area where the animal had been standing , because i was so terrified .
they wanted no part of it .
they had no interest in trying to confirm their own theory such as looking for bear tracks in that area ?
i usually just lurk around this site and having spent some time now reading this thread i feel the need to a least post just this one time on wgbh 's behalf .
please keep in mind that this is only my opinion , based upon my own experiences with " bigfoot @-@ like " creatures in the woods .
john is pretty brave to be posting his experience on this site , for sure , and i am duly impressed at how well he is being treated here , for the most part .
however , i just have to say that i think it is ludicrous for john to accept any other explanation for his encounter except for what it is .
he saw a bigfoot @-@ like creature .
i believe him .
i wrote a dissertation awhile back on the bff , that __quant1__ expounded on more in __quant1__ of my blog writings , concerning the different personalities in the " bigfoot community ".
part of it concerned the differences between " believers " and " knowers ".
the difference between john and some others is that john is a " knower ", not a " believer ".
you can " believe " all the evidence ( whether it is scientific or not ) that you want , but until you have your own sighting , you can never be a " knower ".
whether he likes it or not , john is in the class of " knowers ".
only those who " believe " in bigfoot will argue with a skeptic .
those that " know " these creatures exist won't waste their time .
it is something like a __name1__ arguing with an __name2__ about religion .
it is a no @-@ winner , for either side .
i am not a amateur psychiatrist , like some folks here , however i truly believe that those that claim to have had hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations must be truly weak minded to believe that malarkey and to believe that it applies to john 's experience .
( do n't take it personal , i am not slamming anybody in particular ) .
john may be weak willed , but he sure as hell is not weak minded .
anybody that has read his postings on the various forums @/@ messages boards can attest to that .
you guys have been so busy sharpening __name1__ in this thread that it has become a dull blade .
john has posted his encounter .
he has never wavered from what he has originally stated concerning his encounter .
i think he has done a pretty good job , considering he was __quant1__ when it happened .
i am sure there could be more learned from him , however , his __name1__ over the incident probably has closed his mind off to some of the events and he can n't recall everything .
__quant3__ thing __quant3__ would like to mention , that i hope john finds useful in his quest to unravel this mystery , is that based upon my own experiences with these creatures , i believe that john 's encounter involved not __quant1__ , but __quant2__ creatures .
these creatures hardly ever hunt singularly .
they almost always tag @-@ team .
i am not sure what the purpose is when they are foraging for plant foodstuffs , unless one is supposed to stand watch while the other eats .
when hunting live prey , one seems to always drive the prey into an ambush by the other .
i find it doubtful , that the one that john saw , put " the stink " on him .
there is no indication in john 's report that the creature passed by his deer stand , before he stepped out in front of him .
given that john was guesstimating that the creature was approximately __quant1__ yds in front of him , i find it doubtful that any smell was being given off from the creature that john could have smelled .
i believe that the " stink " that john smelled probably came from the other creature that was hiding in the brush closer to the deer stand .
( oh , and speaking of the " stink " that john got a whiff of , just like a " creature sighting ", there is no way a person can ever truly describe the " smell ".
it is like nothing you have ever smelled before and once you smell it , you will never forget it .
it will make your eyes water and can very well make you " sick to your stomach ".)
i do n't believe these creatures are harmful to humans , however , it is not the __quant1__ you see in the woods that you should be worried about , it is his partner hiding behind you in the brush that should give you cause for reflection .
i can only imagine how much more john 's reaction would be if he ascertained that another creature was closer to the deer stand during his encounter .
of course , like i said earlier in this post , these are only my opinions , base upon my own experience with these creatures .
i am not here to post about my experiences .
just to give john some " food for thought " concerning his own encounter .
the only other thing that i would tell john is that i would n't let a bad experience when i was __quant1__ keep me from going out and having some fun in the woods .
i think you should buck up , go out into the woods , find the sucker and kick him in the ass !
so i am considered by you to be " truly weak minded " well that 's a confident statement from someone that considers himself to be " not even an amateur psychiatrist "
everyone who has been asking me to describe the smell , pywacket just described it very well .
i am sorry , i need to take a break from answering these questions right now .
no one has done anything wrong , my health is not good at the moment .
i apologize and i thank you for being kind .
i will be ok soon and return .
take care of yourself dude
why would billy be mad at you for going alone ?
should n't he be freaking out with happiness ?
i was just at the most stunning lake and as i was heading into the area i checked a sign board with some info about the lake .
there was a notice that a huge black bear had been seen on __quant1__ of the trails only __quant2__ days before .
we found a women 's sunglasses ( kinda big with sequins on them ) and keys there .
we were wondering how they got there and joked we might see the bear coughing out a hair extension and a broken __name1__ cd .
it 's like the whole general discussion section and the research section basically everywhere that i was regularly posting in and __quant1__ of the people whom __quant1__ was respectfully and civilly interacting with and who do not mind polite and reasonable skeptics might ask where the heck i went .
would n't that be weird to remove from public view the entire general discussion section as well as the research section ?
also weird that they never returned my email seeking clarification on the nature of my removal .
oh well .
interestingly washingtonian in his email called it a suspension of my account but this makes it pretty obvious :
kitakaze
full member
group : banned · posts : __quant1__ · joined : __day1__ @-@ __month1__ 07 · from : __name1__ , __name2__ ( now visiting __name3__ ) · member no.
: 212
luckily i saved many of my posts there to my email for future refence .
i realized when i had a post removed from a thread on the __name1__ cast collection politely asking why we could not discuss whether or not we thought the casts from an admitted hoaxer were legitmate that i was in a highly bizarre situation with a bigfoot enthusiast ( melissa ) behaving very weirdly :
that 's fine , though .
i knew she was very irritated and wanted me gone .
she cheerleaded lyndon when he showed up to debate with me and then when he said he gave up and did n't feel like staying she really seemed irritated .
that 's what happens when you are heavily biased and can n't handle healthy discussion and debate regarding a simple black and white zoological question .
anyway , this is ot .
i will discuss it more in an appropriate thread .
i literally thought when i was at those falls that john would go nuts if he could see this place .
it was __name1__ rainforest on steroids .
i thought that the __name1__ consists of temperate rainforests only ?
you thought wrong , and you did n't do any research .
first we need to know what you consider to be the __name1__ .
billy just worries about me because he has seen me freak out in the woods plenty of times .
i am sure deep down he is happy , but he wants me to understand i should not go out alone as inexperienced and scared as i am .
when i told him it was just a park he calmed down .
billy was right .
__name1__ is a bear hotspot and the big ones are near the coast .

" the next morning i decided to stalk the bear , " rose said .
" i used cover along ditches to sneak to the field .
i shot the bear with a.270 at __quant1__ yards ."
the bear weighed __quant1__ pounds .
after drying , the skull scored 21 , making the all @-@ time boone and crockett record book .
" the bear was a short distance from __name1__ , " rose said .
" that may have helped him get so big ."
robert norville is the commission 's district 2 wildlife biologist .
norville said the biggest bears in the state occur along the __name1__ @-@ __name2__ line .
" __quant1__ remember last year __quant1__ party brought in a pair of bears that were almost identical and the bears weighed around __quant2__ pounds each , " norville said .
" one we checked at the __name1__ @-@ __name2__ line weighed over __quant1__ pounds .
for the largest bears in the state , __name1__ and __name2__ counties have been swapping bragging rights during recent seasons ."
as good as the mountain hunting can be , hunters kill more bears in the coastal region , and bear weights are also heavier .
i would vote that an inexperienced kid got sick in the woods and collapsed , and when he began to recover he saw a big bear standing up and feeding in the distance and blew it out of proportion from being scared and sick and worried and a bit confused about what happened to him .
apparently one of the biggest __name1__ black bears ever recorded was a male from __name2__ that weighed __quant1__ kilograms ...
interesting fact .
i would not have thought that .
most of the black bears i have seen in __name1__ and __name2__ have been small .
now the ones in __name1__ were huge and more prevalent .
or wgbh could have seen a bigfoot .
he either saw it or he did not see it .
lets focus on both explanations .
i was born and raised in __name1__ __name2__ on a large farm in a very rural area near the __name3__ and do not recall any sightings .
all of us boys roamed the woods both hunting and just for fun ; in the winter with the snow on a favorite game was to let someone have a __quant1__ minute head start and then track him .
we never saw __name1__ tracks .
in no way was i relating bear sightings to __name1__ sightings .
i was just commenting on kitakaze 's question " where are bears ? "
my family has spent upteen __quant1__ hours in __name1__ woods and no __name2__ there either .
or bear .
i like to hear about species returning to areas and i know many interested in " __name1__ like " stuff do to .
wgbh , · i have an acerbic tone , i admit .
( __quant1__ strokes has interfered with my brains · checks and balances , so to speak , among other things ) .
i apologize .
but what i have said i stand behind .
what about archangels proposal ?
ap
so nothing solid regarding cougars ( though there are bobcats which people could mistake for cougars ) .
as for the wolves , how reliable is that information you have regarding the shot dead animals ?
if confirmed that would be an example of an extirpated species returning to an area it once inhabited .
i think you might agree this is a very far cry from massive undiscovered wood apes loping about __name1__ tossing rocks over by where the pavilion is , would you not ?
wolves bodies are i dep hands , guess that depends how paranoid you are
i have heard the same from many friends who live there in __name1__ .
there are not that many bear sightings .
we see lots of bear here in __name1__ and in __name2__ . when i went to __name3__ we saw bears everywhere .
no worries and no need to apologize .
what was archangels proposal ?
i guess i need to scroll up and read it .
edit : i scrolled up about 4 pages and could not find it .
it was shown on the page just before this one .
here it is again :
actually , just to clarify my position i have no idea what he smelled and do n't want to say that it might 've emanated from a bear .
i just feel that a physical source of odour cannot be ruled out as less likely than a hallucinated one .
i do have to ask for some clarification from someone who knows the area in question , the swamps i 've been to here in __name1__ all smell bloody awful for the most part does the one in question have a similar sort of odour ?
as i understand it the odour that occurs in swamps can be attributed to the rotting vegetation and animals , coupled with the moistness of the area .
the rotting process can lead to build ups of noxious smelling gases , especially if trapped under the usual layer of mud that is in a swamp .
if expelled this could create a small pocket of less oxygenated air , which could potentially have a foul smell ( ie swamp gas ) .
the lack of oxygen in the area could bring on some of the symptoms that wgbh described ( ie nausea etc ) and if he was feeling faint enough it 's also possible that he may have started to hallucinate things .
it could also explain why the rest of the group did not smell anything by the time they got back , it had dissipated .
note : · i 'm not claiming this is what happened , nor that it 's even likely just that it might be another possible explanation .
ah , i missed that , i must have been hallucinating .
thanks for that kit .
we were not in the swamp proper but the property was near the border .
nevertheless , the smell did have a bit of that swampy methane odor mixed in with the wet dog , rotting flesh smell .
did i smell swamp gas and hallucinate ?
i would answer that the same way i have the other theory 's submitted .
anything is possible , but i find it unlikely .
i will admit that it is more likely then a sleep or brain disorder .
i guess this is another thing i ask the park officials if i can ever get down there .
we are getting swamped ( pun intended ) at work and it is hard for me to get away .
after reading this entire thread i want to say bravo kids you 've done a credible job at maintaining a level of decency !
i think the fireworks are about to launch crow and i have fallen into their clever trap !
eep !
hello john i 've been over to your site and bringing your encounter here while not the easiest place in the world to navigate through the personalities is not a place where kindness in the form of humoring as a kindness is going to fill you up with empty calories .
whatever calories of knowledge you get will be the kind that will give valid energy .
i do not look for kindness here crow .
i look for ideas .
i do not fear what their opinions are .
while i 've never seen a sasquatch and have grave reservations that they managed to hold on into the __value1__ quarter of the __century1__ th century maybe they did , apparently your 's did at least .
perhaps you did see a bipedal unclassified ape munching leaves in the forest .
after all if it lives it eats .
the only point i have contention is the overall size of the creature .
for __quant1__ simply took at face value the size reports .
some of which you know are simply stupendously big .
however i took the time recently to scale some sasquatch to various sized and when i brought up a __quant1__ ft sasquatch next to a 5'9 " man it became clear to me that anything that big would be cutting a pretty wide swath through its environment .
so my only question is was it really that big ?
do you think your __quant1__ footer may have been somewhat smaller say __quant2__ ' @-@ __quant3__ ' which is still huge .
i saw what i saw .
no i am very sure it was well above __quant2__ ft and probably __quant3__ ft . i played soccer for __quant1__ years .
a soccer goal is __quant2__ ft . it was well beyond that .
i could see where its head was compared to the tree .
also there has been issue with the amount of detail you may have seen at __quant1__ yards .
i do n't have any issues at all with the details you may have seen .
__quant3__ yards is __quant1__ ft . the driveway leading up to my studio loft is __quant3__ yards long .
from there i can easily make out details passersby in the street .
__quant1__ ' is not a huge distance by any means .
also you saw that animal through __quant1__ year old eyes .
at __quant1__ my eyes were pretty sharp .
i suspect that the majority of posters here are considerable older than __quant1__ and it is unfair for shall we say middle agers __quant2__ @-@ __quant3__ yrs to discount what a pair pair of __quant4__ year old eyes are capable of seeing at __quant5__ '.
there were details i could not see very well crow .
such as the eyes and the fingernails .
also , it may have been less then __quant1__ yds . it was just an estimate and i was __quant2__ ft up in a tree , so that could make it seem farther then it was .
i could see the back , shoulders , arms and hands well .
my eyes were always sharp .
i just started wearing glasses __quant1__ years ago and i am __quant2__ .
basically that 's about all i wanted to say .
i hope in the end this forum and your own research helps to sort it out for you .
i hope so to and thanks .
excellent discussion , even if it is about bigfoot .
poignant @-@ irony @-@ makes @-@ me @-@ reconsider @-@ my @-@ perceptions hilarious or quirky @-@ throwaway @-@ __name1__ @-@ style @-@ observational @-@ humour hilarious ?
i was shooting for the former .
dude™, it 's been both hilarious @-@ es , and that 's a good thing .
is there some kind of award we can bestow on you when you do yet another terrific and so ******* funny job of repulsing those pesky ( but ) probigfooters™?
seriously , your craftsmanship is impeccable .
the fact you still have wgbh 's ' attention ' is surprising , even if obvious why . i mean ( and i mean it respectfully ) , he 's still stalled on ' he saw __name1__ '.
actually , it is true that wgbh has transformed ( and possibly redeemed ) himself from a literal bff ' forum troll ' to an almost famous and esteemed member of the entire bigfoot community™, pro and con .
gotta respect that .
maybe when wgbh finally does realize there is no bigfoot , and he will , kitakaze will be __value1__ in line for yet another of those awards we decided in the paragraph above to regularly give him ?
we can only pray .
[ quote=wgbh ; 4819035]i hope so to and thanks .
__value1__
i was n't aware i was being mean or nasty to you .
i can pull up the many compliments and words of support i 've been offering you but i do n't think i 'll find anything mean or nasty .
that is the problem kit , you can n't even recognize the hurtful things you say .
before you ask me to " prove my claims " by copying and pasting them , i am not interested in that argument , i can deal with it .
you know when i lost my temper and why i did it .
i told you right here on this forum .
do n't play coy .
i posted that quote on sfb in a attempt to diffuse a situation that crow may have started that i did not want .
i was making light of the situation by saying i am ok and i can handle myself here on the __name1__ fine .
that is all i intended .
it was not a attack on you and it was a mistake to use your name .
i do n't believe that not thinking you really saw a __quant1__ x __quant2__ ft monster wood ape amidst the civilization of the __name1__ @/@ __name2__ state line qualifies as being mean or nasty .
i mean , c'mon .
look at the place we 're talking about .
an alleged encounter in __year1__ __value1__ reported in __year2__ after a long bout of alcoholism and being discussed __quant1__ years later .
i think there is a lot of room for perceptual distortion there but that 's just me .
you have made this opinion very clear .
i get it .
your comment at sfb really does n't seem fair to me .
i understand , but see my above comment .
i 'm a little let down that you would speak that way about me when i 'm not around .
i 've liked you since we first got into constructive debate at you sfb and you told melissa and others to chill out and realize i 'm not trying to be insulting or make things personal when i am debating __name1__ issues .
but you are not around there kit .
you were thrown out for behavior not wanted on that forum by its owner .
the fact that you or i may not agree with those rules is not the point .
if you want to post there you abide by them .
you have no idea how many times i attempted to defuse the situation regarding you and the rest of the admin .
i argued on your behalf on the admin forums constantly .
only for you to turn around and do the same things you were warned about again and again .
you took it out of my hands kit .
news flash , if it was not for me you would have been tossed long before you were .
oh well , i still wish you luck on your road to freedom from irrational fear and nightmares .
thanks
john , maybe you or someone can pass on to log that despite her little spazzo meltdown flip @-@ off to serenity .
no kit , i do not like to pass things from forum to forum , but i was forced to above .
i reject it not only on my opinion , but the opinion of a professional .
please do not expect me to comment on it publicly .
you just did .
hint : if you do n't want to talk about things on a public form then do n't mention them .
hint : i meant the diagnosis .
yes , and you guys at back @-@ to @-@ sleepy sfb can split your __name1__ munns thread into a " whine about __name2__ skeptics " thread .
you 're right .
all my stuff about sfb/abs/melissa and friends is pretty ot .
i do n't feel particularly bad about it because whenever i try to discuss why you could n't have had a sleep @-@ related occurence or distorted memory we get about as far as " i saw what i saw ".
you and everyone here can discuss your opinions about my encounter all you want .
i listen to all of them , but i am not required to subscribe to them .
if there 's any complaint , i could maybe try something lame and say " well did n't the abs think they might have seen bigfoot eyeshine ? "
the key word there is " might ".
eyeshine is not proof .
and we do not · submit it is such .
you are confusing someone telling about a experience on a radio show as submitting it as evidence .
speaking of lame .
i know , not much finesse .
what i find frustrating about situations like this is that i have a conflict between not wanting to be ot ( even in a more open thread like this ) and adding yet another bigfoot thread to the pile while more than a few are active .
with all the silliness that happened with bullet maker doing a lemming run off the face of bigfootery , i 've kind of been giving poor darren lee and the mabrc a break and melissa and friends kookery have put the abs in my sights , particularly with what a gong show the __name1__ expedition was .
may be i will start a thread similar to my mabrc threads and call it " american bigfoot society - the mild bunch ."
if i do , i expect you to do a good job handing it back to the " scoftics ".
kit __value1__ of the __value1__ things you and i ever spoke about regarding bigfoot was mr bilby and his hoaxing .
you do understand that most in this field never bought into anything he said or did , correct ?
he admitted hoaxing to me , · i posted it for all to see , and he is done and good riddence .
please do not infer that the abs has anything to do with hoaxing by comparing us to bullet maker .
that is really crossing a line .
you know that none of us in the abs will stand for hoaxing .
you may continue your silly personal attacks on mself or the research techniques applied , but do not go there .
eta : heeey ...
wait __quant1__ minute .
rob gaudet is an abs and mabrc member .
he 's another one of those exhibitionist __name1__ bigfooters .
i forgot about that :
<a href="http://americanbigfootsociety.weebly.com/abs-investigators.html"> http://americanbigfootsociety.weebly... </a> <a href="http://americanbigfootsociety.weebly.com/abs-investigators.html"> stigators.html </a>
rob 's a riot :
__value1__ href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bvu_z0m0ts"> http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bvu_z0m0ts </a>
great , now you want to make fun of a man that neither one of us know anything about .
yeah , melissa is going to help me find out which person from her bigfooter club swiped __name1__ 's art ...
*miss swan* john , you make a funny !
you crazy !
oh , you make a me laugh !
*miss swan*
well , you throw them down the middle of the plate and i will hit it out of the park ...
why , yes .
yes , john , i did pick and choose what posts i put in my response .
maybe it had something to do with the fact that all of those posts by other members who were n't skeptics and were making reference to __name1__ 's hoaxing preceeded any post that i and then harryh made .
hello , __name1__ ?
is this thing on ?
your claim :
" the people who were commenting about hoaxing from the beginning were you and other sceptics..."
oops for you .
that was n't true , was it , john ?
shall i post the post numbers and exact times and dates that those bigfoot enthusiasts like henry may , creekfreak , and reverend stone made those posts so you can see exactly how long before my and harry 's comments they were ?
i would just tell any person who is n't banned to just go over and see for themselves but uh oh , melissa turtled her board and put all new accounts on preview .
oh noes ...
mehbeh more skaptiks r cuming .
they were not disrupting the thread like you were .
i should have said disrupting and not commenting .
strone only said he will make up his own mind and did not mention hoaxing .
and i find it hilarious that you would quote and use creek freak to defend yourself , especially since you attack him constantly for being a hoaxer .
so i guess that we can say that you support a hoaxer too right kit ?
hypocrite .
so that leaves henry and he only mentioned it , he did not disrupt the thread .
you mean another bigfoot enthusiast who posts in another bigfoot board felt uncomfortable with me pointing out exactly what such a massive collection of casts by __name1__ implied ?
for example , that he would have casted at least 26 individual bigfoots in his small area alone ?
no i mean an administrator from the largest bigfoot forum noticed you acting like a troll as you normally do .
being warned by a bigfoot enthusiast groupie for pointing out the obvious in a civil manner in discussion where the comments are perfectly relevant worries me not .
and acting like a troll , scoftic will get you banned , and it did .
actually no.
john .
i 'm simply pointing out that your claim that no abs member tolerates hoaxers is simply a fantasy .
it 's not about whether or not casts are evidence of bigfoot .
that 's solely your opinion , not in line with that of meldrum , melissa , and a throng of other bigfooters , and a diversion tactic to try and steer away the conversation from your claim .
it is all about opinion and yours is no more relevent then anyones .
including mine , silly boy .
i do n't think it was a travesty that melissa kicked me out .
neither do most of the members there .
says the guy who repeatedly ignores requests to address the simplest questions regarding his sighting while engaging in the topic he complained about as ot .
i 've lost count how many times john ignores this :
you are confusing ignore for disregard .
go ahead and ignore me , john .
ok
john @- you abstained from voting for the banning of kitakaze .
and you act like it was a gesture to show that you did n't really want him banned .
i 'm just curious what your voting record is on past bannings .
have you voted to ban people before ?
, have you abstained before ?
, have you voted not to ban people before ?
abstaining from voting in this case , might be a big deal if you always vote yes or no , on banning , but it would n't be a big deal if you always abstain from voting for banning .
nowhatimean ?
it does n't sound like you 're saying you were the one that lifeted __name1__ 's art.
btw , this is not the __value1__ time there 's been an issue about melissa 's site using art without permission , is it ?
that 's rhetorical , you do n't have to answer .
what i know is that it ended up being a major league catfight for many people myself included and i wasted mucho energy trying to stay out of it last year so thats about my input on it .
i won't go even more ot with mabrc or nesra stuff but i really like the head of your group , chris bartow .
i 've had friendly and helpful discussions with him in the past .
actually chris is one of __quant1__ board members for the group , as am i just to clarify but i appreciate you not dragging nesra into this subject , it really has nothing to do with them .
matters with anderholm are considered ancient history also , fwiw .
it was not in support of his troll behavior .
i just do not support banning anyone and would not do it unless someone threatens another member .
i was content to just edit his posts .
some people do not have the patience for that and he was banned .
i have not been involved with any other ban of a member there , we have not had any since i was a mod or admin .
the majority of the members can behave like adults .
kitz , are you banned from the bff ?
because i see alot of members here are banned .
oh well , must be the mean ol ' scientists who ruin 's everybodys favorite imaginary biped .
just my opinion , but the bff is whole seperate political hornets nest .
__name1__ and foreigners of the __name2__ faith were murdered on __month1__ @/@ __day1__ .
these __name1__ are as much victims of the islamist terrorists as all the others , the __name2__ , the __name3__ , the __name4__ , the atheists .
__name1__ in lower __name2__ go to a mosque or prayer room there , because that 's where they live ot work .
these __name2__ are __name1__ yorkers !
just like all the others : the __name1__ , the __name2__ , the __name3__ , the atheists .
when the planes crashed , when the towers fell , there were tens of thousands of __name1__ __name2__ yorkers in downtown __name3__ , very nearly becoming victims of the atrocities .
now chewy_defense wants to make these __name1__ yorkers , these victims of __name2__ @/@ __name2__ , victims again .
victims of past terrorists , and victims of future terrorists .
up to this point , excellent post .
from this point on , crap .
chewy_defense seems to hate the freedom that the constitution grants to all __name1__ .
bull .
he 's shown no signs of hating anyone or anything .
he respects __name1__ freedoms but sees possible harm to __name2__ should the full extent of those freedoms be exercised by building this __name3__ complex .
like you , i think he is __value1__ % wrong but all he is doing is expressing the fact that his values within those freedoms indicate a different course of action .
that 's all .
chewy_defense wants the terrorists to win .
it 's like he allows them to piss on the graves of __name1__ __name2__ yorkers .
more bull .
he does not want the terrorists to win and your just throwing flame bait to make the claim .
he identifies __quant1__ possible harm and wants to minimize the chances of that happening .
now you and i disagree with him on the potential of that happening and the concomitant damage that will occur if his solution is implemented but that in no way implies his desire for a terrorist victory .
shame on you .
i 'm still waiting for jihadjane 's answer , as to why __name1__ attacked the __name2__ on __month1__ @-@ __day1__ @-@ 01 .
do you agree with mine ( above )?
tam
maybe i should have split the __quant1__ parts .
the latter is mocking chewy 's " arguments ".
i do .
more or less .
i 'd explicitly mention __name1__ support for non @-@ democracies like the monarchies of __name2__ @-@ __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , or the de @-@ facto @-@ dictatorship of __name5__ .
they attacked in large part because of ( a ) __name1__ 's relationship @/@ defense of __name2__ , and ( b ) the perceived __name5__ invasion , both physically ( as seen in __name4__ ) and mentally of the __name3__ ( as seen in the __name5__ emeriates ) , etc...
tam
and at the same time declared war on the __name1__ king because he allowed us bases in the holy kingdom to help us fight __name2__ and for us to defend the kingdom .
i agree with it also ; pro @-@ __name1__ @/@ __name2__ presence .
their hating our freedoms had very little , if anything , to do with it .
plus __name1__ had an extreme hatred toward __name2__ from his college experience in __name3__ .
where is jihadjane 's answer ?
can you really blame him on that one ?
one can take only so much __name1__ before wanting to kill someone ...
( disclaimer : i do watch an occasional nascar race and enjoy them when i do .
moderation is key .
much like __name1__ and __name2__ )
space in the __name1__ is a premium .
i do n't know why they 'd devote it to this drudge that insults people 's intelligence .
well they devote space every week to __name1__ to write tripe like <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/17/opinion/brooks-the-jeremy-lin-problem.html"> this </a> .
__name1__ is anomalous in all sorts of ways .
he ’s a __name1__ grad in the n.b.a . , an __name3__ @-@ __name2__ man in professional sports .
but we should n’t neglect the biggest anomaly .
he ’s a religious person in professional sports .
he posted an opinion about their opinion piece ?
my opinion : · it seems that the writer of the __name1__ op @-@ ed would be ok with a __name2__ __quant1__ @-@ party state - just as long as they mostly did what he considered would make the nation great .
his main point seems to be that you can justify restricting democracy as there are objective " right " courses of action , which the powerful can perceive but the hoi @-@ polloi are too ignorant to appreciate .
( consider me underwhelmed )
he also appears not to value highly : · a ) the right to disagree with him ( aka what right would he have to force his policies on an unwilling majority ) · b ) cut down corruption and keep politicians responsive by the threat of not re @-@ electing them .
far from being dogma , point ( b ) , when combined with transparency , is a very practical tool for encouraging good governance .
point ( a ) may somewhat be considered dogma ...
but to ignore it would be to throw away vast amount of equal rights @/@ equal protection ethics and law .
in my opinion , his opinion ain't worth the paper its written on .
( and that 's plenty bad as the __name1__ aint worth much at all ) .
are you reading his mind ?
you 're trying to argue a strawman .
supporters of the __name1__ ( such as myself ) will say : supporting unsavory regimes may or may not be justifiable , i.e. aid given to __name2__ in __name3__ - despite him being ' orrible - was arguably the lesser evil .
when we view __name1__ oppression ( i.e . at __name2__ ) there does n't seem to be , what we would consider , a moral justification for it ( unlike some __name3__ actions @/@ aid given during __name4__ and the __name5__ ) .
note : that does n't mean that the __name1__ always made the right decision , or that said support always turned out for the best , but it was intended to and often did .
unlike the __name1__ regime - which appears to simply value the amoral pursuit and retention of power .
you seem to be using the exact same argument you say is strawman !
the article itself does not say the __name1__ atrocity was a good thing , what he argues is that it " was arguably the lesser evil ", which is the exact same argument you use to say why you will support at times regimes that commit atrocities .
as i said above it 's an " the ends justify the means " argument .
and __name1__ 's tiananmen ?
the __name1__ attacks ?
was that necessary too ?
none of which addresses the question , what exactly about the __name1__ form of government makes it proveably superior to what actually worked to get a __quant1__ people from the primitive conditions of the mid __century1__ th century to __name2__ 's status today ?
and for me being a pragmatist this is very important to understand .
i feel that my democracy ( warts and all ) is " better " but lets say look at something that i consider very important in my society i.e. social mobility .
it is hard to argue with the empirical fact that the government in __name1__ over the last __quant1__ decades has done more to enable and promote social mobility than has been possible under my preferred system over the same period .
it may well be that my preference is fundamentally no different to the fact most __name1__ are born into christian families .
the article is rather silly .
it contends that democracy is young and that therefore history favors dictatorial systems of government .
in doing so it ignores such facts as that the world changed in the past __quant1__ years by more than it has changed in the previous __quant2__ - or indeed that the __name1__ system it praises produced - just in the past __quant4__ years - __quant3__ major upheavals , one of which ended up as the greatest humanitarian disaster in history .
it also ignores the fact that the rise of __name1__ coincides perfectly with their shift towards a more __name2__ model of economy .
it 's patently ridiculous to claim their system is superior because it produced better economic results in the past three and a half years .
well , for one it did get approximately a billion people from the primitive conditions of the mid __century1__ th century to __name1__ status today .
that counts ?
mchrozni
on what planet did __name1__ have a __quant1__ citizens and progress __quant2__ centuries in a little over __quant3__ years ?
and right there is the whole problem i have with those who argue in favor of __name1__ 's policies towards __name2__ .
the priority of his transgressions is determined not by net human suffering caused by him , but rather by whether supporting him benefits the __name1__ or not .
personally , i 'd argue that by far and away one of his " main transgressions " was the attempted genocide of kurds , and the use of banned chemical weapons in doing so .
but you see , those __name1__ made the silly mistake of not being __name2__ citizens ...
so their attempted genocide is a " minor transgression " which can easily be swept aside .
the issue is not one of priority but in the timeline of how events unfolded .
saddams ' chemical attacks and genocide against the __name1__ happened just before the end of the __name2__ @-@ __name3__ war .
us support for iraq quickly dried out afterwards , and left iraq alienated from their key ally .
you were told so before .
unless you 'll claim that the __name1__ would have to foresee this __quant1__ before the events took place you will need to address this issue .
as to the relevance to this particular debate , it is n't the specific action , but rather the mentality behind it .
if one argues that " the end justifies the means ", and that supporting __name1__ was justifiable because of some distorted idea of a " greater good ", then other governments have exactly the same prerogative to engage in abuses and atrocities , so long as they believe that it brings about some kind of " net benefit ", otherwise known as the " it may be bad , but if we had n't done it , it would have been worse " argument .
how about this - the ends sometimes justify the means .
in the case of __name3__ @-@ __name4__ war , supporting __name2__ prevented a rise of a fanatical __name1__ power bent on domination in a critical region of the world .
in the case of tiannmen __name1__ , the massacre prevented ...
what exactly ?
political reform that would end in somewhat lower economic growth for the next decade or __quant1__ ?
the discrepancy is so huge i can easily say that the ends justify the means in __quant1__ case and do not in the other without applying any double standards .
thus ...
if it is okay for the __name2__ to support despotic regimes because it benefits american interests , then it is likewise okay for __name1__ to support despotic regimes because it benefits chinese interests .
and if it is wrong for __name2__ to do it , then it is wrong for __name1__ to do it .
of course it is , but when viewed in the proper context , it is quickly evident that __name1__ support for __name2__ is radically different from anything __name3__ is doing .
point out __name1__ support for __name2__ or __name3__ or __name4__ if you will , those actually have significant resemblance to what __name5__ is doing .
i 'm not taking sides .
i 'm standing resolutely in the middle , saying that both sides are wrong -- and that confuses the hell out of those who see the world in black @-@ and @-@ white .
i can sympathize with that , but you picked an entirely wrong example .
mchrozni
so your argument is what ...
that __name1__ censor their newspapers , so __name2__ should do the same ?
that it 's wrong for a newspaper to have an opinion piece that expresses opinions contrary to your own ?
an idiotic argument on the face of it .
but i did n't make that argument !
so ...
you 'll close your eyes , plug your ears , and go " nanananana ...
i 'm not listening to you ! "
again , an idiotic argument .
strawmanning , are we ?
regardless of your personal opinion of it , this is a perspective shared by a significant number of people in the world ...
and understanding it is far , far superior to saying , " i do n't like it , so it is wrong to express it ".
except that i did n't say so .
congrats ...
idiotic argument number __value1__ !
since nowhere did i say that you are expected to agree with the article , or believe that the __name1__ gov't is ' better '.
the only issue here is that the __name1__ , and any other newspaper , not only has a right to print such things ( and not face the same kind of censorship that is practiced in __name2__ ) , but that printing such articles is good specifically because it expresses a view that while not mainstream in the __name3__ , is a dominant view in __name2__ .
and understanding how other people think is the __value1__ step towards improving communication and relationships ...
as opposed to ...
oh ...
i do n't know ...
simply declaring that anyone who says anything you disagree with should be silenced , or has no legitimate right to express their views .
i had __quant1__ major points with my post .
one to cast light on that such articles are not permitted to be printed in __name1__ , but in the __name2__ , and perhaps some conclusions can be drawn from that .
second , to reject the notion that the options are either __name1__ government or __name2__ government , and particularly the us is not the only democracy , and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/democracy_index"> not even the most democratic country </a> .
both of which you completely missed ( or at least did n't bother to address ) .
enough of this .
you know , i do n't agree with many here , ( thankfully .)
i 'm quick to point this out for several reasons , not the least of which being that i am not always right .
i enjoy a good political rhubarb as the next person , but this is getting out of hand .
( and some of you thought claus was bad ! )
to put it bluntly , this kind of behavior is precisely the kind of thing the __name1__ brothers or __name2__ get accused of : belittle the opponent , degrade their humanity , malign the intent of their opponents , and on and on .
i get a little tired of it , particularly since there 's little reason for it .
it accomplishes little .
i do n't agree with __name1__ , yet i can n't help but laugh as the guy takes on everyone from __name2__ to __name3__ .
he 's not only fair , he 's accurate .
he does n't need strawmen to make his point : the facts do it for him .
no , we do n't have a political system like __name1__ 's .
i 'm grateful for that .
but there are elements of tactics which the __name1__ use which make me cringe , and some of these are utterly useless and barbaric .
and ultimately , they drive away posters i want to hear from on issues where we might disagree and , ( dare i say it ) , where i might be wrong .
i 'm glad there are those of you who have never made a mistake in your political beliefs .
good for you .
no doubt your track record demonstrates we ought to be kneeling at your kiln @-@ baked toes and heeding your every word .
the rest of us have had to make mistakes and learn from them .
it 's how i learned to drive a truck , and it 's still how i 'm learning .
interestingly enough , i used to be ashamed of not having taken a driving course .
on the other hand , in some ways , i 'm a better driver than some for having had to learn it the hard way , and having had to take my knocks .
it has n't been easy , and some of the lessons have been expensive .
none , however , have resulted in injury or death .
it 's a lot more than i can say for some of the jokers i 've worked with who took extensive driving courses .
( including the guy who rear @-@ ended a city bus , then blamed the passengers for taking too long to board .)
just a reminder : i 'm about to become a business owner .
one way or another , it 's going to happen .
i realize in the parlance of one board member , this will make me a " right @-@ wing ( capitalist ) drongo , " but it 's also going to make me an employer .
perhaps not right away , but eventually .
there 's a lot to learn in this path , and i 'm still trying to feel my way through .
easy ?
no.
mistakes ?
bound to be many .
i 'm in a country which will allow me the option to make them .
i 'll take that .
i do n't expect anyone to agree with me .
but at some point or another , i 'd like the opportunity to be heard , without being belittled for it .
there are a lot of times when recognizing you 're ignorant comes after you 've put that ignorance on display .
it 's called " learning ."
no one ever said it would be easy .
although when a thread gets to the point of being more a pissing match than an opportunity to learn what others think , unsubscribing is very easy .
here you go and make this great post , and it appears that everybody just ignored it and wen right back to bickering ...
well , i want you to know , i read it man .
well said .
perhaps you could try to fully explain your position properly next time instead of leaving it open to interpretation .
i thought i did , but wolfman left the thread apparently .
it 's been a long time since i saw the show , but from what i recall , i did n't take away that message from it .
i just remember it being about a father trying to find out what really happened to his daughter , and __name1__ 's radioactive act of revenge towards the end .
i also recall it being a very well @-@ made program .
it is indeed great !
especially __name1__ 's acting , as ronald craven , and the character darius jedburg ( i am guessing this is __name2__ ) .
you 're also right that it was about __name1__ 's uncovering of stranger and stranger circumstances behind his daughter 's death but throughout the series he is " visited " by his daughter who was , in life , some kind of environmental activist for a group called " gaia " who tells him some story about " black flowers " which somehow kill everyone off .
i think at some point jedburg says he saw the same flowers in __name1__ and thinks there may be some truth to this .
it is somewhat subtle and i probably would n't have noticed it had i not watched it recently but it is , i think , something of the moral message to the tv series .
i agree though , that the series was really well @-@ made .
looks like i 'm not the only one who 's been reminded of it either :
<a href="http://craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2011/03/edge-of-darkness/#idc-container"> http://craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2...#idc-container </a>
exactly .
i 'm sure this has come up already but could someone tell me , in a nutshell , what was so disastrous about __name1__ .
i 've known the name for a while as the name of an extraordinarily bad event but i have n't found any references to casualties in my ( albeit ) cursory search .
§ the plant is safe now and will stay safe .
§ __name1__ is looking at an ines level 4 accident : __name2__ accident with local consequences .
that is bad for the company that owns the plant , but not for anyone else .
§ some radiation was released when the pressure vessel was vented .
all radioactive isotopes from the activated steam have gone ( decayed ) .
a very small amount of cesium was released , as well as iodine .
if you were sitting on top of the plants ’ chimney when they were venting , you should probably give up smoking to return to your former life expectancy .
the cesium and iodine isotopes were carried out to the sea and will never be seen again .
§ there was some limited damage to the __value1__ containment .
that means that some amounts of radioactive cesium and iodine will also be released into the cooling water , but no uranium or other nasty stuff ( the uranium oxide does not “ dissolve ” in the water ) .
there are facilities for treating the cooling water inside the __value1__ containment .
the radioactive cesium and iodine will be removed there and eventually stored as radioactive waste in terminal storage .
§ the seawater used as cooling water will be activated to some degree .
because the control rods are fully inserted , the uranium chain reaction is not happening .
that means the “ main ” nuclear reaction is not happening , thus not contributing to the activation .
the intermediate radioactive materials ( cesium and iodine ) are also almost gone at this stage , because the uranium decay was stopped a long time ago .
this further reduces the activation .
the bottom line is that there will be some low level of activation of the seawater , which will also be removed by the treatment facilities .
§ the seawater will then be replaced over time with the “ normal ” cooling water · § the reactor core will then be dismantled and transported to a processing facility , just like during a regular fuel change .
§ fuel rods and the entire plant will be checked for potential damage .
this will take about __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ years .
§ the safety systems on all __name1__ plants will be upgraded to withstand a __quant1__ earthquake and tsunami ( or worse )
see these posts for some detailed pictures and explanations .

skwinty ...
sounds as if the reactor cores are being directly flooded with seawater .
reactor cores are not generally flooded with coolant i assume .
is this seawater being circulated somehow do you know ?
thanks .
only this afternoon there was an item about the fact that many ( petro @-@ chemical ) pollutants were washed over crop fields because of the debris carried by the tsunami .
most forms of petro chemical polution of agricultural soils have a tendency to abate over time due to bio @-@ degradation .
it is even possible to remediate heavy metal polution through bio remidiation .
although , it is likely that most of these feilds will need to be taken out of production for a while .
the power plant itself was the only real casualty .
i was listening to a harrowing account of an elderly women looking through the wreckage of her home for her husband 's medal ( he had died __quant1__ days before ) and __quant2__ of the journalist 's descriptions turned to the globules of tarry petrochemicals dripping from everywhere .
the local refinery had exploded before catching fire , how much damage is that type of pollution going to cause ?
yes a nuclear reactor malfunctioning is very worrying - especially one so old - but i suspect that compared to the pollution caused by everything else as a result of the tsunami and earthquake it will be almost insignificant .
ah , but it has the word " __value1__ " in it !!!
i made a blog post about this whole situation last night , for what it 's worth :
__value1__ know __value1__ japanese __value1__ & __value1__ nuclear hysteria </a>
cheers - mm
well written .
for the lurkers , since dc appears to be trollin ' away to the hills now :
the problem at __name1__ is a serious one .
no one doubts that , and no one expects anyone to ignore it like it 's a small car crash .
nuclear facilities going into meltdown is a big thing , and if the worst case scenario happens , will be a dangerous thing too .
however , as has been pointed out time and time again , meltdown does n't mean nuclear waste/fuel/radiation being pumped into the atmosphere .
nuclear meltdown does n't mean the ground will be poisoned for __quant1__ .
nuclear meltdown with intact and fairly stable containment means a big mess and a lot of expensive cleaning up .
if the containment was absent as it was in __name1__ , yes , we would be seeing radiation entering the air at a fairly alarming rate , and if the containment is destroyed we might also see some smallscale but highly dangerous leakage .
as it happens though , at worst __quant1__ reactor containment area has been mildly damaged .
this sounds alarming as hell , but all it means is a small amount of radiation is being leaked .
so far this has peaked at a level that is not dangerous for small scale exposure , but prolonged and continuous exposure could well be harmful .
however , it is notable that this peak was short lived , as far as i am aware , although if anyone wants to contradict me , show your sources .
all this means is that in order to be in any danger whatsoever , you would have to stand in the affected area ( between __quant1__ reactors mark you , so not somewhere __name1__ is likely to be ) for a prolonged time without a protective suit .
further to this , as it stands the radiation levels are dropping and plant cooling is occurring .
a couple of the reactors have already gone into cold shut @-@ down , meaning that they are now safe , and only one other reactor , __name1__ , is still being cooled .
this procedure seems to be going as smoothly as it can given the devastation wrought upon the area by the natural disasters that occurred .
the same can not be said for the petrochemical plants in the area .
that is not the way i udnerstand what is happening .
the current issue now is not so much the reactors themselves , which are still at risk , but the spent fuel pools .
the last explosion was caused by __quant1__ of those pools in a reactor building where the reactor was not even in operation .
they do n't even know the status of the pools at reactor 's 1 and 2 .
those pools are not in containment like the reactors are .
i think they 're talking about __name1__ , not __name2__ .
damn , all their words look alike to me .
ah , damn .
not so good then .
still good news .
that is diffusion , not decay .
{/semantic nit pick}
it 's both due to half @-@ life being so short .
some of the gases have half @-@ lives in the minutes , some in the hours .
so dose drops quickly .
about the __quant1__ msv @/@ hr figure :
the __name1__ reports __quant1__ msv " beside unit 3 " and about __quant3__ μsv/hr at the nps ( __quant4__ assume nuclear power station ) border .
<a href="http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/engnews01_1300189582p.pdf"> http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_i...300189582p.pdf </a>
on the other hand , they quote the " chief cabinet secretary " as saying " __quant1__ msv @/@ hr in the vicinity of unit @-@ 3 "
<a href="http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_images/pdf/engnews01_1300191989p.pdf"> http://www.jaif.or.jp/english/news_i...300191989p.pdf </a>
i 'm not sure , but my guess is that the cabinet secretary misquoted the numbers .
that could well be .
the media here is confusing milli @- and microsieverts all the time ; it 's not fear @-@ mongering ( the errors go both ways ) , it 's just scientific illiteracy plain and simple .
well i am not so sure if i would want to be living death sick or rather death .
an in @-@ depth __name1__ study , described as a " __quant1__ @-@ volume , __quant2__ @-@ page report and incorporating the work of hundreds of scientists , economists and health experts , assesses the __quant3__ @-@ year impact of the largest nuclear accident in history " had this to say about the health effects on humans :
approximately __value1__ 000 on @-@ site reactor staff and emergency workers were heavily exposed to high @-@ level radiation on the __value1__ day of the accident ; among the more than 200,000 emergency and recovery operation workers exposed during the period from __year1__ @-@ __year2__ , an estimated 2,200 radiation @-@ caused deaths can be expected during their lifetime .
an estimated five million people currently live in areas of __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ that are contaminated with radionuclides due to the accident ; about 100,000 of them live in areas classified in the past by government authorities as areas of " strict control ".
the existing " zoning " definitions need to be revisited and relaxed in light of the new findings .
about 4,000 cases of __name1__ , mainly in children and adolescents at the time of the accident , have resulted from the accident 's contamination and at least nine children died of __name1__ ; however the survival rate among such __name2__ victims , judging from experience in __name3__ , has been almost __value1__ % .
most emergency workers and people living in contaminated areas received relatively low whole body radiation doses , comparable to natural background levels .
as a consequence , no evidence or likelihood of decreased fertility among the affected population has been found , nor has there been any evidence of increases in congenital malformations that can be attributed to radiation exposure .
poverty , " lifestyle " diseases now rampant in the former __name1__ and mental health problems pose a far greater threat to local communities than does radiation exposure .
not quite the radiological disaster on human health as one might have thought given the seriousness of the accident .
wow , it seems that we , and especially mattusmaximus , stepped massively onto greg laden 's toes .
he 's doing quite a bit of complaining <a href="http://scienceblogs.com/gregladen/2011/03/the_fukushima_disaster_hyperbo.php?utm_source=networkbanner&utm_medium=link"> here </a> .
greetings ,
chris
who is greg laden and why should anyone care ?
those hydrogen explosions that have been on the news and __name1__ admitting that the core water level in the three reactors are half full , recovering from dried and half full , indicate to me that this is a full on complete meltdown in all __quant1__ reactors .
in __quant1__ of those they are admitting that there is fuel damage and they are venting the containment , which means that we have a continuing uncontrolled release of fission products to the atmosphere .
there are very brief moments in my life when __quant1__ wish that the internet was just turned off - reading your post was __quant1__ of them .
edit : and yeah , thanks to such people the spent fuel has to be stored on @-@ site , usually on or above ground level , instead of being burried in a mountain or somewhere .
makes it sooooo much safer .
not .
who 's spinning rubbish now ?
" such people " have got absolutely nothing to do with why the __name1__ keep spent fuel on @-@ site .
correct me if i 'm wrong .
well turn off your computer and turn on the tv , can we agree it 's a 6 now ?
i 'm ashamed of being __name1__ these days .
__name1__ politians are claiming that this will bring the end of nuclear power worldwide .
yeah , it is pretty scary to see so many __name1__ buying into hysteric woo .
bad historicall precedent .
very bad .
i 'm usually a champion of __name1__ as a news source but their reporting on this story ( at least on __name2__ and __name3__ ) has been appallingly bad , spreading all kinds of misinformation , though i do n't necessarily think its deliberate .
it 's just sloppy .
i 'm considering sending a nastygram to __name1__ in particular , for his sky @-@ is @-@ falling reporting on m.e.
i think you can safely ignore what they say on the subject .
__name1__ on __name2__ was just as bad .
also , this is how anti @-@ nuclear people work here in __name1__ :
1 ) complain about nuke power being somewhat subsidized , but never mention that renewable energy is highly subsidized
2 ) complain that the operation of nukes costs so much money , but then go ahead making massive protests & demonstrations at , and tie themselves to , the train tracks of the __name1__ transports .
this causes extreme delays in the transport , requires way more police personnel then normally required for that longer time .
and last time , the managed to tie them to the tracks in such a way that workers had to actually cut these tracks apart and repair them afterwards .
3 ) complain about the fact that there is no suitable terminal storage facility , but actively work against getting one built .
4 ) complain about old , unsafe reactors , but force the government to ban companies from building new and safer ones .
at the same time this also causes the companies to keep the old ones running even longer , prolonging the risk .
for example , here in __name1__ , if you have a photo @-@ voltaic system running ( solar cells ) , the energy companies are forced to buy that electricity , and the pv owner gets about __quant1__ euro @-@ cent per kilowatt @-@ hour .
regular electricity costs " only " about __quant1__ or __quant2__ euro @-@ cent per kw/h . and in that price there is the added premium of __quant3__ or __quant4__ cents per kw/h included that results from the " erneuerbare energien gesetz ( eeg )", which means " renewable energies law ".
this means that _everyone_ has to pay a premium to keep that system alive .
i 'm absolutely sure that if those people who have contracts for getting only renewable energy instead of the regular energy mix , would have to pay the _full_ price , they surely would be the __value1__ to scream " we want nukes ! "
after all , that price would be at least __quant1__ to __quant2__ cent per kw/h , if the pv owners already get __quant3__ cent ....
and they have the balls to complain that nuclear energy is partially subsidized .
hypocrisy at it 's finest , i tell you .
let 's not forget that they also want to have electric cars everywhere instead of combustion engines .
but somehow they do n't spend __quant1__ minute thinking about where that amount of electricity should come from .
let alone the problems of manufacturing and disposing suitable batteries .
i simply fail to see how all that is supposed to work , and to be achieved , in the long run .
without exception they all completely ignore the energy , material , production , build and space needed to switch to renewable energy completely .
for them , wind @-@ parks and solar @-@ panels seem to grow on trees , install themselves , hook themselves up to the grid , and need no space at all .
and of course these technologies are obviously able to produce electricity __quant1__ @/@ __quant2__ , regardless of the fact that most of the day there is n't enough sun or wind .
but hey , i 'm happy to switch to renewable energy .
bring me a bunch of anti @-@ nuke people and a bunch of stationary bicycles with fat dynamos , and i 'm sure i can manage to hook them to my distribution box .
presto , renewable energy !
greetings ,
chris
why is the anti nuke movement so much more powerful in __name1__ then it is in other __name2__ countries ?
just curious .
the evacuation zone was precautionary .
so far , nothing has happened to require a complete survey before letting people return to their homes after the crisis is over .
case in point if it is __quant4__ micro sv per hour at the plant outside perimeter , it can n't be that high __quant5__ km , __quant1__ km , or even __quant3__ km away .
the explosions were from hydrogen gas generated when the reactor cores , and apparently in at least one case , a spent fuel rod pool , were partially uncovered by falling ( evaporating , maybe leaking ) water levels .
the steam was dissociated into its components hydrogen and oxygen .
this is not true .
the hydrogen comes from the zirc @-@ water reaction .
zr + 2h2o -> zro2 + 2h2
if they kept the pumps running , then why did __quant1__ reactor buildings blow up ?
building that had fuel rods on top of the buildings ?
why did they run out of power after __quant1__ hours ?
that does n't make any sense at all .
and if something does n't make sense , it probably is n't true .
if you lost your power supply , and you know that if the pumps stop it is disaster , why would they not fly in power for pumps ?
before they fail ?
this is wrong .
there is something wrong here .
read .
previous .
post .
in .
thread .
if that is true , then the design of the back up system is terrible .
hindsight is 20 @/@ 20 , especially for armchair analysts .
__name1__ , former defensive coordinator of __name2__ 's football team , has been indicted on multiple charges involving sexual contact with a minor ( you can find the indictment <a href="http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/uploadedfiles/press/sandusky-grand-jury-presentment.pdf"> here </a> , but be warned it is a very difficult read ) .
over the course of over __quant1__ years , he used his charity for underprivileged children to meet potential new victims and established a pattern of abuse which has now been brought to light .
there is much to be discussed here , especially regarding the responsibilities of witnessing parties @/@ athletic administration and the way the public will view the tragedy in the scope of " well , it 's awful , but how will it affect football ? "
this is beyond disgusting , many people should be in prison over this .
__name1__ broke down talking about it on __name2__ .
i 'm not a legal expert , but i think failure to report is something that you can only get fined for , kind of a public shaming .
but i agree , there should at least be a house @-@ cleaning in the athletic department .
one thing that is interesting is the contradiction between what __name1__ has said in his public statements recently ( namely , that the ga gave him explicit details matching the testimony of what he witnessed ) and in his own testimony ( namely , that the ga had told him " something of a sexual nature " had been witnessed ) .
either he was really being vague on purpose in his testimony , he 's lying now , or he was lying on the stand .
all of this is just awful .
first of all , i 'm stealing that line .
second , i was just taking a look at this animal 's __name1__ entry and found this :
should i be as disturbed by this as i am ?
this whole thing is disgusting .
it really makes you wonder not only how widespread it is , but also how widespread it could become .
i recently read about the custom of men in the __name1__ keeping harems of boys , and how some of the boys interviewed said they could n't wait to become men so they could get their own harems of boys .
i had a job that required me to visit some charter schools in __name1__ , out in the rural areas .
something stood out to me -- all the teachers at the __quant1__ schools i visited were men .
it struck me as odd , so i did an online search of teacher statistics and found that __name1__ has a higher number of male teachers than the national average , by a significant amount ( this was a few years ago , so __quant1__ can n't remember the exact statistic ) .
i know there is a well organized international network of pedophiles , with their own websites , etc. i started thinking , what if word got around about places ( like __name1__ , for example ) where child sex was easy to get , or where so many members of the population were pedophile @-@ friendly , that no matter how high you went , you could not get anybody to take any action against them ?
now comes __name1__ with a pretty good example of how that can work .
i do n't know who blew the whistle on this one , but if __name1__ were a close friend of the governor or the president , we might never have found out .
if i were to witness a man anally raping a __quant1__ @-@ year @-@ old , i 'm not walking away from that .
i 'm not leaving that child there .
and if--if--it came down to violence to stop him , then that 's what it comes down to .
make of it what you will , won't hurt me none .
i 'm not trying to hurt anyone , but most would claim the same about joining the __name1__ and persecuting __name2__ in __name4__ __name3__ .
electrocuting people as part of an experiment , etc. meanwhile we know demonstrably that most of the time this is not the case .
fine ; a whole bunch of apathetic individuals came across this .
highly doubtful , and not in relation to any of the psychology topics i mentioned .
nothing seems to have changed .
whether the inaction was the result of people just not particularly caring , or choosing their friend 's safety over the rape victims ', or being absolutely evil ...
it makes no difference to the outcome , any more than does the fact that , after all , __name1__ did run a charity for children .
they chose to do nothing , and because of that more abuse took place - both directly ( in the case of the little boy __name1__ was allowed to finish raping after being walked in on ) and indirectly ( in the case of other children __name1__ had access to who were abused because nobody reported sandusky ) .
all their current finger @-@ pointing and buck @-@ passing and shouts of " it was n't my responsibility " that we 're currently witnessing is nothing but a qed of exactly the attitude that facilitated __name1__ 's abuses .
obviously it won't change anything in this case , but understanding why this happened again and again could help lead to policies preventing such lapses .
or it could help us better correct for such perverse influences our own moral thinking .
and in the case of blame i think proclaiming guilt on a person affects both individuals , so it is best to be most accurate .
the discussion has n't been about the issue ; it 's been about what a bad guy the graduate assistant was .
according to the indictment , the graduate assistant was " distraught " and " upset " by what he saw .
basically he was a victim of __name1__ , too .
the transgressions listed in the indictment began in __year1__ , and there were many opportunities along the way for other people to stop __name1__ before he raped the boy in the locker room __year2__ , including an actual police report in __year3__ .
if responsible people had done their jobs , the ga would not have been put in a position he had no training for .
it 's definitely a fascinating phenomenon .
the ga , as an employee of the school and part of its culture , somehow " got " that going directly to the police might not work out for the best .
could he believe his eyes ?
would he embarrass the boy ?
would the police believe him over a professor emeritus ( which __name1__ is )?
i am sure many questions ran through his head while he was trying to deal with what he had seen , or thought he had seen .
and what about all the other people who " knew , " but did n't want to know ?
__name1__ 's wife , the boys ' parents , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , the police detectives who interviewed sandusky in __year1__ and got him to promise never to do it again ?
so much goes into enabling pedophiles , especially when they are respected members of the communities .
the victims themselves do n't even know what 's going on when it is happening to them ; they do n't even know they have rights .
until recent times , pedophilia has not been , in our culture , a simple question of right vs. wrong or black vs. white .
a lot of it has been about protecting the " dignity " of the predator .
i agree , except for the beginning bit as being stated too strongly .
while many seem content with the " kick the pedo 's ***" motto and no one has said they would do the same as these individuals , it is remarkable how many individuals independently " knew ".
thanks for picking me , alb .
i 'll try not to let down the side .
what i actually said , both times , was that i would get that child out of that place .
the order of events and their priority are really important , you see .
the child 's safety is my prime objective .
i mention violence to the perpetrator as a secondary possibility that i 'd take on only if necessary to secure my primary objective .
if i could get the child out of there without touching the perp in any way , i 'd certainly rather do that .
i did n't mean to misquote you , i apologize .
how do i know i 'd react this way ?
i 've __quant1__ reasons :
1 . having survived serial sexual abuse , i know first @-@ hand what that child 's experiencing ( as i rather expect a certain number of the rest of us might be able to say , true ? )
and my __value1__ instinct today would be to immediately secure that child 's safety .
from a purely personal point of view that not everyone can share with me , i do know my instincts .
2 . i know i 'd do it , because i 've done it before .
what other people 's reasons are for saying the same thing i 've said , i could n't tell you .
i know only what i would do , i know exactly why i 'd do it , and i know i 'm certain of it .
in that case , you most certainly do know what you would do , and i 'm deeply and truly sorry you experienced such an awful thing firsthand .
so what 's the argument here ?
that i 'm wrong to state absolutely that i know i would have reacted differently ?
because i 've re @-@ read my __quant1__ initial posts on the subject , and nowhere in there did i talk about anyone 's reactions but my own .
now i realizes this means i 'm also criticizing __name1__ 's actions by implication .
so are you .
so is everyone else .
no one here is excusing him .
the problem seems to be only that a few of us are claiming to know what we 'd do in the same circumstances .
why this is a problem for anyone , i cannot fathom , any more than i can fathom simply walking away and leaving that child to be raped .
i won't be discussing it any further .
i see no point to it .
my own point was simply to express my utter incredulity that anyone , anyone , could simply walk away from a child being anally raped , right before his eyes .
i 've expressed that .
if anyone else has anything to say about it , fap away .
i do n't have a problem with you saying that , and i do n't think you 're wrong .
i am sorry it seemed that way .
i think that since this is such an emotionally @-@ charged topic , in particular for someone who went through sexual abuse , that it is easy for things to be misconstrued .
i find it difficult to imagine anyone , in particular myself , responding the way macqueary did .
i do n't feel a need to continue that particular line of discussion , myself , as i do n't really see it going anywhere productive and i do n't want to drive away intelligent participants from the conversation .
i sincerely apologize if it seemed as if i were criticizing you or saying you were wrong , as nothing could be farther from the truth .
it 's fine , really .
i 'm not angry , especially not with you , and i would really hate it if you came away from this thinking i were angry .
i assure you sincerely , that is n't the case at all .
your points are well @-@ taken .
but i could counter them , and did , and that 's all .
no harm , buddy , and surely no foul , to use a likely inappropriate sport metaphor .
i think if there 's __quant1__ thing we can learn from this whole thing , it 's that absolutes are never correct
right - a false dichotomy i was responding to in posts in this thread .
in essence , __name1__ goes all __name2__ on __name3__ or he 's a complicit monster .
it seems to me that a __value1__ rd option of " he should have at least called the police " is also being advocated here .
thus , how 's about we put off the " string him up " talk until we know what the heck we 're dealing with ?
some of us do n't want to wait __quant1__ or __quant2__ to have a discussion on " current " events .
waiting until we know what really happened usually requires , at a minimum , that the investigations , trials , and appeals be concluded .
and usually , even then , we won't know the full story .
it 's ok to form opinions and discuss them in the meantime .
i trust most of this people on this site to modify their opinions accordingly as new information comes in .
oh , yeah , absolutely !

what everyone is calling rape and anal assault probably looked like ( based on the report ) an adult having sex with a minor .
illegal and deplorable , yes .
rape ?
yes .
anal assault ?
depends on your definition of assault .
in need of immediate intervention ?
that is not so black and white .
were this a boy and an adult woman with her hands on the wall , would everyone be as visceral in their reactions ?
would everyone feel it needed to be stopped immediately ?
<snip>
an adult having sex with a minor is legally rape .
a man having sex with a minor is taking .
a woman having sex with a minor boy is taking by giving , providing satisfaction .
i think this is a good point .
children are devalued in most __name1__ cultures .
we all learn at home and in school that adults are to be given the benefit of the doubt , while children are not .
most of us are prepared to discipline children at the drop of a hat , but there are a lot more cultural rules to be followed when confronting other adults .
you seem to have missed his point .
you know , not that i 'm excusing it in any way , but i can understand the catholic apologetics like __name2__ in the wake of the __name1__ scandal , because the rcc is founded on religious beliefs .
people are afraid of the word of the __name1__ __name2__ or __name3__ being undermined , so they rush in with the support of people who failed to act as an attempt to preserve their faith .
i may think it 's terrible , but at least i can wrap my brain around their mentality .
but football ?
people let this continue for __quant1__ , and now fans are showing outpourings of support towards __name1__ , because of football ?
i really agree with this .
here is an article that expands :
it ’s connected to the __name1__ , “ conference realignment ” and all the ways in which college football has morphed over the last generation into a multibillion @-@ dollar big business .
this is n’t about sandusky .
this is about about a culture that says the football team must be defended at all costs : a culture where the sexual assault of a __quant1__ @-@ year @-@ old is reported to __name1__ before the police .
this is what happens when a football program becomes the economic and spiritual heartbeat of an entire section of a state .
the __name1__ football regularly draws __quant1__ fans to __name2__ .
they also produce $ __quant1__ in pure profit for the university every year and has been listed as the most valuable team in the __name1__ conference .
another economic report held that every __name1__ game pumps $ __quant1__ into the local economy : from hotels to kids selling homemade cookies by the side of the road .
it ’s no wonder that __name1__ is revered .
he took a football team and turned it into an economic life raft for a university and a region .
when something becomes that valuable , a certain mindset kicks in . protect the team above all over concerns .
protect __name1__ .
protect __name1__ football .
protect the brand .
in a company town , your __value1__ responsibility is to protect the company .
<a href="http://www.thenation.com/blog/164433/college-footballs-logic-why-joe-paterno-and-penn-state-would-shield-child-molester"> linky . </a>
also :
the love was evident as several hundred students crowded around __name1__ 's house , located just a couple of blocks from campus .
chants of " we are __name1__ ! "
and " __name1__ ! "
filled an otherwise quiet , darkened street .
<a href="http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7210030/penn-state-nittany-lions-coach-joe-paterno-receives-students-support"> linky . </a>
and note that __name1__ " retired " right after that incident , in the prime of his career when he was a shoo @-@ in to get a head coaching job .
speculation today is the retirement was forced because __name1__ knew he was a child molester , yet they allowed him to use their facilities for his football camp for troubled children .
there was a scandal at __name1__ last year that created a lot of furor locally ( i do n't think it got much national news attention ) where an unidentified athlete was accused of sexually assaulting a freshman girl .
the university waited __quant1__ weeks before contacting the __name1__ police , by which time the alleged victim had committed suicide .
that actually looks well @-@ handled in comparison to the __name1__ scandal .
well @-@ handled ?
to revisit this : i think you 're off your rocker .
i can n't conceive of a single instance of an adult " having anal sex with " a __quant1__ @-@ year @-@ old that would not qualify as an assault , nor can i imagine what makes you think that there 's any kind of circumstance which would render such a rape not in need of immediate intervention if such is possible .
in retrospect , this is one of the most abhorrent posts i 've ever had the pleasure of reading on this forum .
it seems to me that people up and down the chain of command have violated the cleary __name1__ .
every time someone on my campus is mugged , rather a lot , now i that i think about it , the campus police release a report of the incident and highlight the cleary __name1__ in the subject line .
this full disclosure is federal law , and if it was not acted on at __name1__ , well , yikes .
the __name1__ reports that the __name2__ . is now investigating .
well @-@ handled ?
by comparison .
the furor over __name1__ was that they waited __quant1__ weeks to notify the police ( or properly counsel the victim ) , while __name2__ never did .
were it not for the __year1__ complaint that brought on the grand jury investigation i doubt they 'd ever have said anything .
this is a ridiculous comparison , and i have to wonder why you would go to such lengths to make excuses for the guy .
i would not .
i find it interesting that people keep assuming this because i point , as others have , to the social sciences for understanding these actions .
it is disappointing because i really wanted people to focus on the facts and not my personal opinion on it all ( more on that later ) .
__quant1__ off , the people in __name2__ __name1__ had been brainwashed for __quant1__ , with nazi propaganda promoted to kids from the cradel .
kids were even told to inform on their parents if they started telling them anti @-@ __name1__ ideology , so you had a situation where parents saw their own children being bred into nazis by the state but felt powerless to try and stop it .
second of all , not collaberating with the __name1__ had enormous repreccusions .
you or your sons could be sent to the __name1__ front .
you could end up in a concentration camp , or prison , or summarily executed .
you could lose your job at a time and place where starvation was rampant , and your family could die if you lost your job .
that was absolutely nothing like what this guy faced .
he was not brought up in a culture where child rape is acceptable .
he was not risking his life to help the child .
the very worst thing that could have happened to him is that he would not be believed and he could loose a job .
and this is __polarity1__ winter in __name2__ __name1__ in __year1__ .
losing your job does not have the same consequences .
wah , sorry , i must have written that unclearly .
i was trying to argue against a famed moral dilemma that has people in their armchairs pontificating that they would never turn in __name1__ , etc. you are exactly right about the influences at play that lead to normal people behaving in such an abnormal manner .
and the reason people are focussing so much on the ga is with the actual perpetrator , well he 's clearly just an evil person .
evil people do evil things and what else can you say about it ?
but by his own admission , the ga was very distraught over what he saw .
he knew he saw something horrible .
he was n't some low life sociopath or masochist .
that makes him failing to act much , much worse .
he was exactly the kind of person who could and should have interceeded .
agreed .
this idea about " not comprehending what he was seeing " or " thinking he was hallucinating " really is a ridiculous stretch , and i do n't see how someone could go to such lengths to excuse him .
to that extent , yes .
and the fact that his father is saying that " he did exactly what he was supposed to " and making it seem like the ga is himself a victim in all of this - mary stating that he is a victim in all this , is simply disgusting .
this guy was not a victim .
seeing something difficult does not make you a victim .
this guy was not some __quant1__ year old kid , he was a grown man who could have intervened , and did not .
he was a coward , and there is no excuse for him .
calling him a victim , mary , is simply beyond terrible .
that child was a victim of both his rapist , and the man who saw him and did nothing .
the child was his victim , this guy was a victim of nothing but his own cowardice and moral failings .
i agree .
my problem has n't been with any of this , but the way people have been acting like his failing was some unthinkably extreme character deficiency .
my real position is that human nature is horrible , from our rational moral principle perspective .
this man 's character is no more scummy than one 's neighbour , who honestly is probably sitting on a similar story about uncle joe .
and by " no more " i mean just as scummy , just under the right bizarre influences .
when i was having sex at __quant1__ , people " knew ".
it is an age old story because human nature does n't change .
so people can leap onto their high horses and espouse moral dictums , but i will be skeptical .
[ snip]...
i 'm sorry that you were abused , but i disagree with your viewpoint .
i believe it 's our tendency to make excuses , to forgive those not upholding our morals , avoiding accountability , and lauding the protectionism of authority that create this tendency towards inaction .
we have to reward the good and point out the bad : hold them up in the light and declare this is who we really are .
reports of __name1__ getting a lawyer has sparked a slew of rumors about what he knew/did .
it 's the way he coached and ran that team as a family .
very few programs achieve that level of big @-@ time football success with such a high level of academic success .
skip class ?
you 're benched .
fail a class ?
benched , or off the team .
want your name on your jersey ?
go somewhere else ; we 're a team .
the whole " we are __name1__ " thing came from an incident in which the team was set to play in the segregated __name2__ and one or more of their __name3__ __name4__ players were taking heat .
the team 's response was that all of them , black and white , were integral to that team identity .
it was a gutsy show of solidarity against institutionalized racism .
through the __quant1__ , __name1__ could 've made tons more money .
he could 've recruited better athletes and won more championships .
but he had a love of that community - to which he 's donated __quant1__ - and a dedication to honor __value1__ , and winning __value2__ .
that 's why it 's so painful now to learn that in this critical instance __name1__ 's moral compass sent him to the __name2__ .
he really is a superb human being , but in this case he flat out failed to live up to anything near his own code of honor .
that 's the tragic irony and the cognitive dissonance here .
well said , thanks .
he is certainly not faultless here and he knows and has said as much ; his punishment is far more than a sad ending to an unmatched and otherwise extremely honorable career .
it 's living with knowing he could have done more .
i would examine the evidence available and then make my mind up .
if i thought a member of my family or circle of friends had responded as was described in the grand jury paper i would be more angry than i would on learning of a similar set of circumstances involving a work colleague .
good idea , although i 'm betting initially you would assume innocence and need __quant1__ heckuva a case and a lot of evidence to be swayed otherwise .
and there is little evidence in this right now .
there are accusations and testimonials only .
strong stuff but imo not nearly enough to *bang* stop or i 'll shoot .
i just think it would have been nice @/@ advisable to have this go to court and know what 's what before people started throwing molotov cocktails every which way .
he has been in a position of knowing he could have done more for the last ( around ) __quant1__ years so i do n't see why it should now start being a punishment ?
__quant1__ 'm not sure , but to me a superb human being might be moved to get off his ass and go investigate when it 's reported that __quant1__ of his staff
__name1__ was not one of this staff .
oops , sorry , i threw another fact in there .
i keep forgetting they do n't matter in this issue .
an irrelevant fact .
snip ...
snip ...
that 's the point i was making earlier when i said i could understand why he did not take immediate action when he saw the child being raped and i accept that is how humans can react in such stressful circumstances .
but that only covers the immediate reaction , from what others have posted it seems that for __quant1__ after witnessing the child being raped he would have seen the rapist with young children .
given that i do think it is right to conclude that to not have taken further action over that timespan is a character flaw .
wow .
what caliber weapons do you folks carry ?
on the internet , everone is __name1__ with an __name2__ .
it is soooo easy to sit here all comfy behind a computer with the luxury of hindsight and chit chatter away about i woulda done the exact right thing at the exact right time blah blah blah .
but when something this shocking blindsides you in an instant , fyi it might not be so easy @/@ simple and being human you might not take the best path .
i do not excuse anyone in this situation who did n't , btw . just something to think about .
this reminds me of a situation that happened to me a while ago that shows the apathy of even the police .
( warning , read completely , for my sake , lol .)
it was __name1__ and me and some friends were at the bar , a female made her way over and started to hit on the lot of us ( __quant1__ gents in total .)
, one friend was not into anything of that nature , but me and the other were good to go .
now she was drunk , but no more than us , ( or so we thought ) and she was rather up front about what she was looking for .
it was snowy , terrible , and none of us had coats ( and i found my cab money has disapeared .)
so we started a rather long walk across town .
now half way there she starts acting very erratic , getting intensely angry , not being able to stand , then getting really happy ( also unable to stand .)
, keep in mind it was around __time1__ am , so frequently we were telling her to not yell so loud , etc.
now , i inquired and found out that she did large doeses of prescription drugs , and they had just started to kick in . so the plan changed from what it was , to getting her somewhere so she did n't wander off in the snow and die .
now , while i know we were doing good , think of what this would look like to onlookers .
__quant1__ gents , seemingly dragging a very inebriated girl around saying things to the nature of " just shut up " ( in relation to her loud screaming of odd , or vulgar things .)
i personally thought we would get stopped at some point and have a long awkward explination .
but not so much , people looked , some people almost came over , but no one did anything .
even when we walked by a female cop , and she jokingly said , loudly something about being kidnapped .
the cop was about to come over , but decided against it .
i just do n't get it , if the people were wrong , it would just have been a laugh , nothing big except for some wasted time , and awkwardness .
but what if we were planning something bad and taking her against her will ?
( which , it really would have seemed .)
sometimes i just do n't get people .
( as a post script , upon getting back to my friends place , she proceeded to puke violently , and then , of all things , still try and push for the threeway .
seeing as she was completely out of her mind , though very energetic , __quant1__ spent a couple of hours convincing her it was a bad idea , and that , at least , she should wait to sober up a bit to make that decision .
thankfully that pissed her , off and she ended up getting a safe way home with our __value1__ buddy . )
hmmm , you know , this would actually be a problem for me .
i live bordered by __name1__ on __quant1__ side of my neighborhood and __name2__ and the other , on the main street , and in a bar heavy neighborhood .
and just in general , i live in __name1__ , which is filled with college students , __name2__ , and __name3__ .
if i stopped a group of people everytime i saw some guys dragging around a drunk girl shouting vulgarities , that 's all i 'd be doing every friday and saturday night .
you do n't seem to have read the grand jury paper - in that he stated that he was informed of ( at least ) a matter of inappropriate sexual activity .
i condemn him based on his own testimony .
he has had years in which to take action - he choose not to .
as i understand , he was on the staff when the __value1__ incident happened .
btw i 'm amused by this part , because i do n't have the impression that you 're fact @-@ oriented .
just the opposite actually .
oh , those poor kids men .
so shocked and disoriented by what was seen and reported that they could hardly get it together to plan their __quant1__ football games between the incident and last weekend .
i just feel horrible for them .
what is this world coming to ?
won't somebody think of the children football coaches ?
could n't have possibly put it better than this .
this actually seems to be the prevailing attitude at a few __name1__ message boards i 've lurked at .
that not one person who approves of __name1__ 's firing is anything more than jealous of his success or is just reveling at seeing an icon fall .
in fact , i 've seen multiple cases of people saying things like " we will rise above this " and genuinely portraying this entire scandal as a concentrated attack against for __name1__ .
everyone 's just jealous of how awesome they are , and will stop at nothing !
there are a fair amount of people arguing - seriously - that most of the anger about the case is about people not being __name1__ fans .
there is a lot of claims that this is nothing more but some giant conspiracy between the media and anti __name1__ staters to bring them down .
there are many people acting like this entire scandal is about nothing more than malicious efforts to bring down __name1__ because of how awesome they are .
they are painting themselves ( school , faculty , and fans ) as the real victims in all this .
the big argument they are using is that __name1__ and __name2__ both reported the incident to their superiors , and that going to the police would have been wrong because they would be undermining their superiors .
they are literally saying that going above one 's superiors is worse than going to the police once one 's superiors take action .
what gets me is that there are people not just excusing __name1__ and __name2__ 's actions as understandable human foibles , but are actually praising them .
i have seen large numbers of __name1__ cheerleaders saying that it is wisdom and maturity to not go to the police but instead count on one 's superiors to handle things directly and defer to their determinations ( such as not pressing charges or going to the police ) .
while they all seem to agree that the superiors are at fault for not reporting it , __name1__ and __name2__ are to be commended simply for reporting it and then doing the " appropriate " thing by not undermining their superior 's decision .
and i 've seen variants of this line about a million times by now :
" i really feel sorry for people with such hate in their hearts that they feel the need to go after __name1__ after ( list professional accomplishments of paterno ) .
__name1__ did what he was supposed to , and still has said that he is sorry he did n't do more .
as a __name1__ , i pity all these hateful critics and i will pray for them ."
also , __name1__ fans are being encouraged to wear white to the next game in order to protest the persecution of __name2__ and express their support .
wow , this is pretty appalling .
fanboys will always be fanboys , but for a pedophile @-@ enabler ?
unbelievable .
and it 's not like he 's even going to jail , he just got fired .
boo ******* hoo .
please keep in mind swearing must be completely masked in the public sections of the forum .
posted by : __name1__
" did what he was supposed to do "...
wow , i hope these tards are never witness to any kind of crime or assault on my person , because i know i could never count on them for help .
i just do n't get this .
__name1__ tells __name3__ that he saw " something inappropriate of sexual nature " between __name2__ and a __quant1__ year old kid .
and __name1__ says , " ok , thank you for that , have a nice day " and tells the ad ?
that does n't make any sense .
he does n't say , " what do you mean , " inappropriate "?
what exactly did you see ? "
this was an act supposedly by his best buddy , happening right in his lockerrooms , and he does n't ask for any details to find out precisely what the guy was talking about ?
i said it before , this was __name1__ 's football program , and he is responsible for stuff going on within it .
he can n't pass the buck and say , " don't look at me , i told my boss ."
but no , he acts as if he got a memo from the __name1__ and forwarded it on to his superiors like he was supposed to .
it just does n't make sense .
if that is what he did , he totally ignored the severity of the accusation , if not legally , but absolutely in terms of the impact it could have on his football program .
yeah , the more i think about it , the more i believe that not only did __name1__ fail miserably at handling the case , but he was possibly completely aware of what was going but was just protecting his buddy .
i can n't prove this , obviously , but when you gather all the facts , it paints a likelier story , imo .
anyway , he 's either a completely incompetent coward , or a lowlife scumbag protecting his child @-@ raping friend .
you are probably not told even once what to do if you see a man raping a child in the shower .
because there are some things you do n't need to be told since they are so bleeding obvious ?
he did n't look away and he did have empathy for the victim .
__quant1__ years old sounds old but it is n't .
that he was a graduate assistant suggests he had been in school basically his whole life .
students , employees and young people in general learn to defer serious problems to their superiors , whose jobs are to resolve them .
__name1__ is an interesting case in that he was practically raised to be a part of the __name2__ family .
son of prominent local businessman , star quarterback for the local schools , eventually __name1__ quarterback .
if there was ever someone destined to spend their life on the sidelines with __name1__ , it was him .
actually , he told his father , who told him to tell paterno , then he told paterno the next day .
who waited a day before telling his boss , who waited a week before telling his boss , who did n't do anything of merit apart from taking the keys to the locker room away from __name1__ .
edit : also , the ga did n't just witness a child being molested .
it really needs to be stated that what the ga saw happening was full anal intercourse with a __quant1__ @-@ year @-@ old boy .
the fact that it was then euphemized as " some horseplay in the showers " by administration officials is something that really outrages me .
i did n't know it was that bad .
according to __name1__ that is exactly what did happen - have you not read the indictment ?
i did n't read it .
did the kid say anything ?
did __name1__ have eye contact ?
if so and __name1__ walked out , he should be fired as well .
i think you mean " __name1__ ".
at any rate , according to the gj report the boy and __name1__ did make eye contact when he saw the boy being raped .
yes , my bad .
gawd knows why i do n't catch those typos , i try to re @-@ read posts after i post them but i still seem to make lots of errors .
the kid has never been identified , so we only have __name1__ 's word for it .
and __name1__ says that both the child and __name2__ made eye contact , and saw he was there .
the grand jury testimony is located <a href="http://www.freep.com/assets/freep/pdf/c4181508116.pdf"> here </a> if anyone needs the link .
read the testimony .
very little is left to the imagination ...
and there is precious little room for interpretation .
__name1__ said __name2__ and the kid saw him but he did n't say there was eye contact .
i mean , saying they saw him could mean eye contact or it could mean no eye contact .
just clarifying , in case it matters .
i think it is likely there will be some fakers ...
actually very likely ...
i speak from the experience of my own province .
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/13/world/shelburne-journal-tales-of-sex-violence-and-greed-in-a-small-town.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm"> http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/13/wo...ted=all&src=pm </a>
this will cost the __name1__ at least __quant1__ .
there will be a huge pot of money there and people will do almost anything for money .
__name1__ loyalists should not worry about the school 's bank account .
all it takes to refill the cache is a few dot @-@ com billionaire alumni who still care deeply about their alma mater .
note the __name1__ on the __name2__ are still living high off the hog despite the many bankruptcies supposedly resulting from the claims of their hundreds of rape victims .
most research so far has refereed pedophilia as a ' paraphilia ', which essentially means getting off on sick and abnormal things and situations .
i 've read that some professionals have called pedophilia a sexual orientation because , just like ' homosexuality ' and ' heterosexuality ', it is usually stable and is formed early in the sexual development .
notwithstanding whether calling pedophilia a sexual orientation is in anyway good and informative , this naturally causes all kinds of controversy because it includes such freakish monsters with " normal people " and how it supposedly ' normalizes ' pedophilia and child @-@ molesters .
a common theme is that people started to make homosexuality acceptable then later it will be pedophilia and then it will be ...
the end of society ?
<snip>
so pedophilia is not considered a result of a developmental disruption ( like rape or molestation as a child ) and therefore preventable ?
i was so hoping ...
i assumed that was what happened to __name1__ .
i have n't read every post , but i have n't heard about any of his victims actually coming forward..
have they ?
__quant1__ article __quant1__ read said the average pedophile has over 200 victims in a lifetime .
i do n't know about paedophilia generally , but wrt pederasty in particular i read __quant1__ article somewhere that said it was caused by an extreme form of sexual narcissism .
its basically love of an idealised , younger version of the molester 's self .
so i suppose it would be caused by similar things to those which cause narcissistic personality disorder .
i 'm not sure though , i 'd have to look the article up .
they must be considering children in images and videos the pedophile looked at in order to arrive at __quant1__ .
that can n't be the number they physically touched ....
if that 's what you read there is no way that is true .
you know how you read something , and a half @-@ formed thought comes immediately to mind ?
my half @-@ formed thought was ...
has it then been incorrect all this time that some victims become abusers ?
does that then never happen ?
i 've heard that it does , all my life it seems .
but if pedophilia is an orientation , like homosexual or heterosexual or bisexual ...
then victims do n't " become , " do they ? ...
or do they ?
or what ?
repeating a question before answering it is thought to be an indicator of deception , according to this :
<a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/neuronarrative/201106/how-we-know-youre-lying"> http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/...ow-youre-lying </a>
i have encountered this notion before .
i know it 's a delaying tactic , but i would think even an honest person might use it , if they know the answer is n't exactly going to make them or the situation look good .
if they need time to make sure they answer with the truth , but in a way that won't be misperceived .
it could go either way , i suppose , and it 's probably more important to also be looking for the other indicators in that list , as well .
__quant1__ marker does not a liar necessarily make .
of course , he is lying .
slingblade ,
thanks for the link .
the author wrote , " how hard is it to catch liars ?
very , according to geiselman and __name1__ , another researcher who has devoted his career to identifying the signs of deception .
in previous studies , __name1__ found that without training , the average person 's abilty to identify a liar is roughly the same as chance ."
skeptical greg ,
the __name1__ @/@ sollecito case is a helpful reminder of the benefits of ignoring the chaff that is put out right after an arrest .
i can understand why people would have thought __name1__ and sollecito guilty if they listened to the statements made by police and prosecutors , many of which were false .
ditto with respect to the __quant1__ defendants in the __name1__ lacrosse case .
innocent until proven guilty is not just a good idea ; it 's the law .
yet this standard does n't mean much if the jurors have already made up their minds .
nor does it serve any purpose for the <a __value1__ governor __name1__ pennsylvania </a> to weigh in __name2__ mcqueary 's moral obligations , although at least he has not been indicted ( in which case __value1__ governor should keep completely quiet ) .
you are correct that innocent until proven guilty would still apply even if we had a video tape of the alleged rape in the dl case or the sexual assault @/@ murder in the __name1__ @/@ sollecito case .
fortunately the alleged acts in each of these __quant1__ cases flew in the face of the laws of physics and physiology .
moo .
not when the man publicly states he enjoys horsing around with young boys in the shower .
there 's not a glimmer of a resemblance to sex killer __name1__ or liar what 's @-@ her @-@ face at __name2__ .
why do you suppose the gov went on public record ?
he 's __quant1__ of the trustees who is absolutely responsible for the mess at __name1__ .
he gets to cover his ass ( probably a well @-@ advised move here ) while placing all the responsibility on the __name1__ administration .
by __name1__ 's own admission , this stuff has been going on for years although he ' defends ' himself by downplaying the blatant sexual assault aspect of his behaviour .
i do n't know if __name1__ and __name2__ were close at __quant1__ point but i get the impression that by the time __name2__ left __name3__ they were on the outs .
__name1__ had the __year1__ incident and according to the gj report not too long after that __quant1__ of the victims said __name2__ told him he would n't be the next head coach of __name3__ and __name1__ was upset about it .
and then __quant1__ year later he retired .
i 've read that at __name2__ 's retirement party __name1__ made only a brief appearance and said only a few words whereas if they were close at that point you 'd think paterno would do and say a lot more at sandusky 's going away party .
i do n't know if __name1__ ever said anything to __name2__ about his behavior but he must have known at least about the __year1__ incident ( before __year2__ happened i mean ) and maybe that 's what turned him cold to sandusky , or maybe he was cold to him already .
i read an column the other day about a guy that was an assistant coach at __name1__ in the __decade1__ s and a victim of sexual abuse himself as a child and it was fairly scathing of psu .
but anyway , the reason i bring it up is that he said that __name1__ used to tell him that he hated __name2__ .
so who knows ?
maybe it was a case of guys that did n't get along personally but who tolerated each other professionally because doing so helped the football program .
the potential cover @-@ up is as bad as the original series of crimes imo .
that should n't just be swept under the rug while all the focus is on __name1__ and his behaviour .
i hope they have the equivalent of a __name1__ to investigate just how far the information traveled about __name2__ .
it would also help to examine other programmes and root out this problem once and for all .
if __name1__ were the only athletic official to have ever faced such charges then i might not be so concerned but read up on the __name2__ situation in hockey .
this is n't isolated ; it 's endemic .
slingblade ,
very , according to geiselman and __name1__ __name2__ , in previous studies , __name2__ found that without training , the average person 's abilty to identify a liar is roughly the same as chance ."
well , in this instance , it is n't very difficult for the average person to come to the conclusion that __name1__ is lying through his lying teeth .
it does n't even make any sense .
he says he stopped it ...
so where 's the kid ?
well no , he did n't say he stopped it ; he said he " made sure it stopped " which is much more unspecific and sounds like he 's setting up some kind of plausible deniability .
especially if the " pimping out to boosters " thing is true .
we have n't heard anything on that in a few days .
why did n't he bring the kid to a hospital , or stay with the kid until the police arrived ?
why did he just send __name1__ on his merry way if he was present enough to intervene and stop it ?
also , i 've heard reports that __name1__ continued to work on children 's charity events with __name2__ after he saw __name2__ raping that kid .
let 's say he did perjur himself .
he did hollar or clock __name1__ and made sure he stopped raping the kid .
but then he just left the just raped kid by himself and went off to his dad , not following up with the police or a hospital ?
how did he know __name1__ did n't go right back and continue raping him ?
he also continued to watch __name1__ interact with kids knowing he was a child rapist .
even this new whitewashed version of events does n't exactly reflect well on him .
also , if he did lie to the grand jury , why would he tell that lie ?
there is no motivation , no incentive , nothing to be gained , in telling the public that ' truth ' but the grand jury that ' lie '.
it only makes rational and logical sense if he told the grand jury the truth , but is lying to the public .
they 've started the pushback against __name1__ 's story :
<a href="http://www.tmz.com/2011/11/15/jerry-sandusky-lawyer-mcqueary-liar/"> http://www.tmz.com/2011/11/15/jerry-...mcqueary-liar/ </a>
that is interesting that the lawyer says he " thinks he may have found the kid in question and he says it never happened ".
given how many kids __name1__ showered with , i wonder what makes him sure he 's talking to the right one .
in any case , it does n't much matter at the very end of the day .
the indictment has testimony from __quant1__ other kids who are adamant that things happened to them , so ...
the potential cover @-@ up is as bad as the original series of crimes imo ....
really ?
in this case the original crimes were many magnitudes worse than the cover up imo , and i frankly cannot fathom anyone saying or thinking otherwise .
and certainly the cover up may have , and probably did allow for further incidents of abuse ; but only in this aspect did the cover up even approach a somewhat similar level of seriousness to the multiple incidents of child rape and molestation .
if the individual said it did not happen ( which is what <a href="http://www.philly.com/philly/news/133872183.html"> amendola </a> is suggesting ) , the __year1__ 2002 incident should no longer be in the indictment .
this might take __name1__ out of the picture .
i think that william anderson was correct to question why the __year1__ incident was part of the indictment , for reasons already given .
if the cover up did in fact facilitate more molestations , i suppose one could argue that it 's all part of the same big predatory " event ".
you do n't go to prison for lying to the public .
stilicho ,
the __quant1__ cases have little in common .
however , __name1__ , the premier blogger on the __name2__ lacrosse case , has some <a href="http://durhamwonderland.blogspot.com/2011/11/duke-penn-state.html"> interesting observations </a> on the present one : " the university reappointed its president , and retained the same faculty hiring patterns that appeared to foster the rush @-@ to @-@ judgment attitude .
it does n’t appear that even any of the faculty members were punished in any way for their dubious and in a few cases unethical conduct .
indeed , several __name1__ members have been promoted to deanships " the __name2__ signed a guilt @-@ presuming statement that is full of dubious assertions and muddled thinking .
moo .
oh and <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/us/victim-penn-state-officials-rejected-claims-university-professor/story?id=14960575#.tsm_enlnpzs"> while we 're at it </a> :
mclaughlin said , after repressing the memories of his alleged abuse , that he decided to confront neisworth over the phone in __year1__ as part of his therapy .
he tape @-@ recorded the conversation , in which he claims that the professor admitted to performing oral sex on him .
" i was in the process of trying to get him to open up about some of the sexual acts and what not , and he actually interrupted me and says , ' do you remember driving up on the hill ?
'" mclaughin said .
" i said , ' wasn't that the __value1__ time you went down on me ?
' he said , ' __value1__ do n't know if it was the __value1__ time but it was certainly fierce , ' was his words ."
over the course of a few months from the end of __year1__ into early __year2__ , mclaughlin said he sent his taped conversation with neisworth to university officials , but each time he was " rejected ."
" they did n't want copies of the tape recorded conversation .
they did n't want to hear it , period , " he said .
" it was extremely emotional for me to have to make these calls to begin with , but then to be rejected the way i was and basically treated as if i had done something wrong in making those calls ."
mclaughlin said he spoke with __quant1__ __name1__ official on the phone at the time who refused to even investigate his claim .
" they said do n't bother sending it we 're not interested in fabrications , stories , any attempts at extortion or blackmail .
i mean , they made it seem like i was looking for something for myself , " mclaughlin said .
" i did n't ask them for money .
i did n't ask them for anything other than make sure they look into this .
listen to the tape and get this guy away from children ."
mclaughlin said he also spoke with former __name2__ president __name1__ on the phone within __quant1__ weeks of allegations being made about former defensive football coach __name3__ sexually abusing young boys .
__name1__ and head football coach __name2__ were fired last week in the wake of the accusations , which were __value1__ reported on __month1__ __day1__ . mclaughlin said he was met with the same " hostility " that he had received from other university officials .
"[spanier ] told me that as far as he was concerned it was hearsay , '[neisworth ] has an impeccable record .
he has never been accused of anything , '" mclaughlin said .
" they were more interested in protecting the school .
they did n't seem to have any interest in protecting children at all ."
neisworth was later charged with multiple counts of child sexual abuse in __name1__ , md . , in __year1__ .
however , mclaughlin claimed that at the time , __name1__ officials said an indictment was n't enough to investigate __quant1__ of their faculty members .
i heard the __name1__ interview .
ok , if you want to shower with kids , there is something wrong with your brain .
i mean , there is something physically wrong with your brain .
if you want to have sleep overs with kids ( as in , m.j. did ) , there is also something wrong with your brain .
why does n't anyone else see this ?
wow , his defense attorney got an underage client of his pregnant some years back ?
what , did this attorney think to himself , " well that would be uncomfortable if brought up , but what are the chances of that .
it 's not like anyone 's paying that much attention to this case ."
*head @-@ desk*
either this is coming completely out of your own head , or you 've got some kind of source that backs you up .
all i have is personal experience , and it does n't back you up at all .
i 'm only asking you show the evidence for your claim so i can evaluate it myself , as you seem to have done .
<snip>
i do n't really think i 'm saying anything controversial , or even anything you disagree with .
all i 'm saying is that when thousands of children were being molested in the ' 60 's , the public did not respond to it the way they can and will today .
it 's my opinion that i fail to see how any adult could n't do all in his power and beyond it if possible to try to stop ongoing pedophilia of which he was aware .
i fail to see what he 's got to be confused about .
that he can somehow find some way to justify it to himself concerns me not in the least , nor does it garner my empathy or sympathy .
describing a person 's possible motives or thinking does not imply empathy or sympathy .
i do n't approve of __name1__ 's failure to act .
they are relevant because they indicate that during the __decade1__ s , the culture took the issue very seriously .
the charges were nonsense , but they do not reduce the conclusion that the culture took the charges seriously .
in fact , it was quite the opposite .
the charges were taken so seriously because , even though the charges were nonsense , people were so outraged that they wanted to make them stick at any cost .
that event , therefore , gives the lie to @mary_h 's claim .
which is the point .
i would suggest that the ' 80 's were when making a big deal out of sexual abuse finally became okay for some parts of the population .
obviously , though , even the ' 80 's were too soon for the population of __name1__ .
and again , you have n't provided anything to back this up .
you have n't shown it was n't a code of silence as opposed to tacit acceptance .
you 've not done anything but make declarations of fact with no evidence whatsoever .
what is the difference between a code of silence and tacit acceptance ?
do i really need evidence to establish that culture changes over __quant1__ years ?
in trying to refute my own claim , i looked for evidence of public sexual abuse scandals before the ' 80 's .
i have n't found anything yet , but i came across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/catholic_sex_abuse_cases"> this interesting information __name1__ wikipedia </a> :
__name1__
__name1__ __year1__ @–@ __year2__
during the __name2__ era , false cases of sexual abuse were fabricated to malign the __name1__ .
the " immorality trials " ( __name2__ ) of __name1__ priests in __month1__ and __month2__ __year2__ are the prime examples of this phenomenon .
[ 40 ] in these trials , innocent priests and members of religious orders became the target of accusations of luring children and youth into sexual acts .
staged trials of __name1__ friars held in __year1__ did not receive the media attention the __name2__ regime hoped for ; and this was not the only problem .
in a case that would eventually be dismissed as baseless the alleged victim , when asked at trial if the offender was in the courtroom , pointed to the president of the court .
[ 41 ] hence , in order to show that the " offences against morality " were a massive problem within the __name1__ , the regime ordered that individual cases should be accumulated at a more opportune moment .
a large number of cases were brought to trial in the spring of __year1__ .
stefan micheler writes :
over the course of __quant2__ weeks between __month1__ and __month2__ , the __quant1__ and party newspapers and radio devoted extensive , front @-@ page coverage to the trials ...
the coverage focused on the seduction of children and youth , the exploitation of relationships of dependence , and the abuse of rank and office .
the press ignored cases where investigations were dropped or trials resulted in acquittals due to lack of evidence or ill @-@ founded accusations .
[ 42 ]
in a speech at __name4__ 's __name3__ on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ , __name1__ stated in front of __quant1__ people that the " criminal aberrations of the __name2__ clergy threaten the physical and moral health of our young people ."
he declared that the " plague " would be " radically extirpated ."
the speech was spurred on by the crowd 's repeated cries of " hang them !
massacre them ! "
[ 41 ] florence tamagne writes : " the anti @-@ __name1__ campaign continued until __year1__ .
by __year1__ , all the __name1__ youth organizations had been closed down ."
however , she also notes that , of approximately 20,000 __name1__ priests , " only 57 were convicted ; of __quant1__ members of the regular clergy , only 7 were convicted .
lastly , of __quant2__ lay brothers , __quant1__ were convicted , mostly franciscans ."
[ 41 ] according to reports published by __name1__ , the propaganda nature of the trials was widely recognized by both __name2__ and __name3__ .
nevertheless , as a result of the trials , children and youth would often avoid socializing with __name1__ priests .
[ 42 ]
~~~ · do i really need evidence to establish that culture changes over __quant1__ years ?
that 's a given .
but .
you need to provide evidence that a specific aspect has changed .
my recollection is that it has n't , at least in regard to adults and actual children ( sub @-@ 15 year olds ) .
emphasis mine - i did n't mean to imply that people in __name1__ 's generation actually give a lot of conscious thought to the victims or consider why they are reluctant to talk about sexual abuse .
i can picture __name1__ thinking " geez , that poor kid " when he __value1__ heard about this , and then never considering the victim again .
yeah , although i readily admit i of course do n't know this to a certainty , that 's my best guess to how this went down as well as far as __name1__ 's concerned .
there was n't overt acceptance of this kind of stuff before but i think there was a kind of implicit acceptance .
i grew up in the __decade1__ s and it was n't so much that it was accepted but rather it just was n't an issue one way or the other .
the __name1__ stuff , which was in the __decade1__ s , was the __value1__ can remember even hearing about or thinking of the notion of child sexual abuse .
as bad as these scandals are ( __name1__ , __name2__ ) i think in the long run they do broader good in the sense that they make the next scandal less likely to happen and they make people less likely to remain quiet when they hear something or something happens to them .
i think __name1__ was the perfect storm .
there probably are n't many assistant coaches at top flight football schools that are child molesters but this one just happened to be at a school where the coach was a legend that had been there forever , and not just winning but running a " clean " program in the sense that historically mattered such as making your players go to class and not paying them money under the table .
and yet since he ( __name1__ ) was so old and society had changed so much , he was n't up to speed on just how bad the actions were .
and the guys running the school , who were more up on things , felt they had to defer to the legend __name1__ and @/@ or protect the program that had been built up for so long .
you 'd have a hard time writing something like this story .
i read a few times , and maybe one of them was earlier in this thread , that in __year1__ or so the __name1__ president and athletic director when to __name2__ 's house to try to talk him into retiring and he turned them down .
in normal times that may just give your football program some extra down years while it 's being run by someone too old to be running it but in this case it happened to also be enabling a serial child molester .
good post , #6 , particularly the last bit .
i 'm __quant1__ .
there definitely was a sea change during the __decade1__ s .
still , putting this forth as if it were relevant to anything in the past __quant1__ years is inane and just shows the power of the myth of legendary __name1__ .
not having known anything different , it 's so weird to me that things used to be this way .
that is , that child sex abuse was so often just swept under the rug .
particularly because people used to be so much more uptight about sex and how dangerous and corrupting it is .
you 'd think people who thought non procreative sex was so terrible and awful would be more concerned about child molestors and exposing them , not less .
not as long as i have been alive ( i 'm __quant1__ ) .
maybe __quant1__ years ago , though , i would n't know about that .
this did not happen __quant1__ years ago .
i do not understand your repeated attempts to rewrite history and make it seem like this is a societal development of the last __quant1__ years , especially considering it requires you to completely ignore the absolute hysteria of the __decade1__ s over child sex abuse .
when i was a kid , just about every family sitcom had a " very special episode " in which __quant1__ of the child characters found out a friend was being abused in some way , and then went and told a parent or teacher , who then contacted the authorities .
you 're misreading me if you think i am trying to rewrite history or even trying to argue with anybody .
people in the __name1__ system knew about __name2__ 's proclivities for __quant1__ , but the case did n't get to the grand jury until __year1__ .
' nuff said ?
- many people here and elsewhere continue to suggest __name1__ not doing more made him an enabler of child sexual abuse .
this is by and large an incredibly unfair label to stick on him .
for one , had the investigation back in __year1__ been handled correctly this would never have become an issue .
so , far more to the truth , all those who failed back in __year1__ are the true enablers .
secondly , several people either witnessed or were directly told of __name1__ raping a young boy in the showers in __year1__ and they did nothing .
they did not stop it , they did not report it .
they swallowed their tongues .
they are all far more culpable than __name1__ .
what do all these things that other people did or did n't do have to do with judging __name1__ 's actions ?
he can n't be a child abuse enabler because other people also had a chance to do something and did n't ?
that 's must makes all of them enablers , including __name1__ .
another point : with the benefit of hindsight we are outraged by the __quant1__ counts related to sexual abuse and 9 or more victims .
but that 's the result of an investigation that went on for over __quant1__ years .
we assume __name1__ had to know a lot since he was everything to __name2__ , but how much did he really know ?
as far as i know , it was the __year1__ and __year2__ incidents , nothing more .
should that be enough ? ..
yeah , i think so .
but it 's not the __quant1__ counts and 9+ victims everyone is judging him by . i think in order to form a final opinion of just how culpable __name2__ truly is , we have to __value1__ understand exactly what he knew , both in terms of the allegations made against __name1__ and what actions were taken to resolve it .
how many times do we hear the phrase " how could they not have seen what was going on " when in fact , they honestly did n't .
( this speaks directly to the accusation of being an enabler , which to me is a conscious action or role .
but if you simply did not see what was going on , for whatever reason , then you can n't be an enabler ) .
i can n't speak for anyone else , but my decision is based solely on the fact that , regardless of how the __year2__ incidents turned out , __name1__ deliberately downplayed the __year1__ incident while knowing that __name2__ had been accused before for the same thing by different kids .
i 'm judging him on what he did , not how many counts __name1__ was indicted on .
and finally , i have often heard the commentary that this was a cover @-@ up to protect the school or football program , but i still do n't understand what this exactly means .
typically , if you are protecting the school or football program , you are hiding activity taken by the school or football program that benefited the school or the football program .
but when it was __value1__ discovered that __name1__ was sexually abusing children , this had nothing to do with the school or the football program per se .
it was entirely about a sexual predator that managed to operate within the confines of the school and it 's football program while going undetected .
the school had nothing to gain but everything to lose by hiding it .
exactly how would it have hurt the school or the football program if __name1__ was exposed right from the start ?
and remember , back in __year1__ the relationship between __name1__ and __name2__ was very strained .
they never really cared for __quant1__ another to begin with , but it had gotten far worse over the last few __quant1__ __name1__ was there .
to suggest that __name1__ would have known exactly what __name2__ was alleged to have done and opted to protect him , for reasons i can n't fathom , seems very unlikely .
so what am i missing ? ?
__name1__ lost his job because of what __name2__ did .
surely he was intelligent enough to foresee that possibility .
i 'm not sure it 's beyond the pale to suggest that __name1__ may have considered his own firing to be a negative turn of events that the football program needed to be protected from .
i have participated actively in this thread for a few reasons .
one is that it 's helped me come to grips with this tragedy that implicates people and an institution that i admire( d ) .
a big reason , though , has been for accuracy 's sake .
i know a lot more about __name1__ than most people do , and characterizations of him as some evil mastermind valuing a winning football program above all else - morality be damned - are flat wrong .
if for no other purpose than for people who do n't know anything about the man to get the tragic irony of this case ( i.e . , that it involves the squeakiest of the squeaky @-@ clean ) it 's been important to set the record straight .
it 's easy to just conclude that his response makes him a total low @-@ life ; the truth is more complicated : he really is a man of impeccable character who did absolutely the wrong thing when presented with this situation , and he deserves to be punished for it .
vicki triponey 's comments suggest that he did indeed value his football program above many more important things .
power corrupts , and this scandal has shown pretty clearly that __name1__ was no exception to that rule .
i 'm sorry , but i think you 're reacting out of emotion because you bought into the myth of __name1__ as the squeakiest of the squeaky clean .
he was not some wonderful man who inexplicably did a bad thing .
he was a fallible being , like all of us , who did good and bad things .
better he should be remembered that way than as some phony secular saint .
i do n't think alimony needs to keep the lesser earning spouse up in the " lifestyle to which they had become accustomed " indefinitely , but i do think that a lot of times spouses ( usually women ) put their careers on the back burner to support the breadwinning spouse .
they miss out on income and earning potential @/@ career growth/education while boosting those same things for their spouse .
if they divorce , i think they deserve at least some money as compensation for what they gave up and to help them get back on their feet .
this is extremely well said .
where __quant1__ bristle at it is in situations where the decision for __quant1__ spouse to stay home was n't made together .
like , the wife unilaterally decides to stop working , or __quant1__ spouse is completely unable to hold a job because s/he is immature , lazy , etc. i 'm not sure what percentage of alimony payments go to people like this , but it makes me uncomfortable that it can happen and i judge the hell out of people like that that demand and accept alimony .
it 's hard for a __value1__ party to say in retrospect whether it was a mutual decision or not , but if __quant2__ spouse has been out of work for many years , it kind of seems like the courts have to assume the other spouse must have been okay with it for the marriage to have lasted so long .
how about this situation : 2 people get married as undergrads , graduate with their bachelor degrees , and make the decision that person __value1__ will work and support person __value2__ + kids while person b gets their graduate degree , then person b will work while person a gets their graduate degree .
person __value1__ asks for a divorce __quant1__ months before getting their degree .
you just described my parents - my mom did get alimony for a few years ( __quant1__ or so ) .
i 'm coming from a different perspective but it is n't out of date .
i stopped practicing law when we had kids because __quant1__ of our careers needed to go on the back burner .
since dh and i have been together and i stopped practicing , his income has more than doubled .
because i do __value1__ % of the child rearing/cooking/cleaning he is able to do what he does .
i still work part time , but my earning potential is not even close to what it was before i stopped practicing if i ever needed to go back full @-@ time .
we made this choice together and if he decides to run off with __name1__ why should my standard of living suffer ?
i can understand why it would be necessary in your situation , but i think it needs to have a defined time limit .
my perspective is coming from the fact that i 'm divorced and my xh tried to milk me for everything i 'm worth , even though he cheated on me .
__name1__ is a no @-@ fault divorce state , so had we have been married longer or if he was laid off before our divorce , could have been responsible for spousal support .
i 'm just a really independent and would n't need or want anyone supporting me .
i would figure it out on my own .
hi everyone ......
have found an open computer at the library so thought it was a good time to let you know how things are .
the fire on tuesday gutted the pumphouse , a 6'x6'x8 ' structure .
hence the name , the well pump was inside and there won't be any water for awhile .
the fire spread to the entryway and pretty much gutted that along with the phone lines .
what is left of the entryway has to come down along with perhaps the outside living room wall and the deck of course .
somewhere along the line , the fire jumped to the house roof which was very unfortunate .
the fire department had a difficult time extinguishing that portion and roof boards were damaged leaving a hole .
in order to find the real extent of what the fire did , the north wall of the kitchen will need to be removed ( inside and out ) along with some of the vault down to the studs , and the roof of course .
due to the age of the home ( __year1__ ) and the extensive remodeling that has occured before i got there , nothing can be determined from the attic or the roof portion in that particular section unless a tear down occurs .
the house if livable , although without water .
i made a decision to stay in the house and not go to a hotel .
there is some smoke damage and i am finding soot in the weirdest places like behind the top of the toilet tank .
if i can get outside every __quant1__ hours for a breath of fresh air , it 's helpful .
the __value1__ well pump person came this morning and was of no help .
the __value1__ person that came was very helpful and is coming again tomorrow with an estimate .
the adjuster and the contractor are also coming tomorrow and that will all take a couple of hours at least to sort through things .
a structure has to be built __value1__ before the pump can be installed .
was a fitful night for sleep , but it was tempered with the fact that i live in a small community and have people around me that are totally awesome .
from the passerby 's tuesday morning who called __value1__ and went in the house to rescue any animals at their own peril , to those who lived close and kept me informed and stayed until the rescue people left .
the phone was busy with people calling , sometimes twice
to make sure that i was ok .
special thanks have to go out to my assistant randy , who on the last __quant1__ minutes of my commute was with me via phone the entire time .
i cannot express my gratitude for that action .
the fire was in the same exact location that it was __quant1__ years ago .
pretty freaky .
thank you for your thoughts , it 's getting me through .
for some reason though , the song __name1__ keeps running through my head .
deb
deb , glad to see that your ok .
well so to speak considering your dilema .
i hope the insurance corrects things quickly for you as you have spent considerable time and money fixing up the place .
must be pretty nerve racking i imagine .
on the good side though your handy man will be around for some time apparently .
good luck girl and hang in there !
just talked to debbie - the insurance guy is out there now already been there 2 and a half hours and is still checking out the outside .....
she is in fairly good spirits and cheerful .
glad to hear you , re ok .
excellent news .
sorry to hear about the fire , been there as a kid , but really glad to hear that you are well and on top of thing 's .
do the repair work and sell the place , in about __quant1__ years or so
if you have to go to the library to use the computer , maybe you should do some research on the houses history , who built it and lived there , and any mysterious circumstances .
i love old houses , and ghost stories
sounds like your neighbours are top notch people .
tony
i 'm sorry to hear about the fire deb , but i 'm glad no one was hurt and that your animals came through unscathed.sounds like you have some fantastic neighbors
debbie , do you mind putting up some pictures of the place ?
i have a hard time picturing the " pump room " and walk way and deck in my mind .
" plane ticket , put the workboots , patterned stockings and tool belt back in the closet along with the bra that covers nothing "
hoping that none of this was damaged in the fire .
hooray -------for a temporary phone line !
hello everybody ,
people started to show up here at __time1__ @:@ __time1__ this morning and it 's been quite a flurry of activity .
__quant1__ contractors , an adjustor , the phone company plus a subrogate investigator .
the investigator was called in thinking that the former owners actions had somehow caused the fire with the way the heat tape was being utilized .
with that phone call , everything here ground to a halt .
debris could not be removed , the plumber could not commence , nothing could go any further .
at 2 @:@ __time1__ pm , the investigator did determine that it was the pump motor itself which was the cause , not the former homeowners actions .
since it is so late in the day now , everything has to wait until tomorrow .
on friday , the new pump motor will be put on , and a temporary structure will be built .
the entryway will be torn off and debris will be picked up , but far as anything permanent , that is weeks if not months away .
thanks for all your concern .........

if the answer is " no " to both these questions , how would you feel about her finding out ?
in the future , would you be happy if she were ( a ) in your position or ( b ) in the position of your lover 's wife ?
or his daughter ?
no she does not know about , but my son , who is __quant1__ is aware of it and has met him .
i do not want her to know as i do n't feel there is any benefit to her knowing as things currently stand .
i honestly would not want her to be in any of those positions , i certainly did n't ever intend to find myself in the position that i am currently in , but i am , and now i 'm trying to decide what to do .
walk away now .

i expect that 's what his wife and kids think too .
clear off out of his life or accept that you 're a __value1__ class woman playing __value2__ fiddle at his convenience because he can n't keep either his mouth or his pants zipped .
that 's not a good role model for your kids .
i 'm not a __value1__ class woman though you 're correct that i am playing __value2__ fiddle at the moment !

__quant1__ have a very close friend who is in a similar situation he is married with no children , she is in a relationship with someone , but when you see them together you can see that they really do both love each other , i have even said to my friend that one day you will have a ultimation the wife or your girlfriend , he has said he would leave his wife for her , yes its all wrong but he has said , we only live once and this is not a rehersal , yes i agree that even a person who is married can fall in love with somebody else , and its life and it happens every day
of course someone who is married can fall in love with someone else , however he should have the courage of his convictions and be with with your friend , not string her and his wife along .

you 're a woman who does n't mind being part of a situation that will cause huge amounts of pain and grief to another woman and her children .

seriously , sisterhood , where did it go ?

i do know that things are n't always rosy for him at home , but i try to keep my thoughts to myself .
sorry sweetheart , but that is the oldest line in the book .
it 's what all men having an affair with no intention of leaving their wives say .
they have seperate rooms , but yes i 'm sure they do sleep together occasionally
and so is this , honestly .
really , he 's making a fool of you .
quote :
so basically , you are n't happy in this relationship ?
quote :
i am single , he has been married for __quant1__ years .
both our youngest children have just taken their gcse 's
balletshoes - ' the __quant1__ thing that stopped me was knowing in that relationship __quant1__ would always play __value1__ fiddle , because he was still with his wife .
as much as we had a strong physical attraction and could talk for hours etc , he was n't committed to me , and could n't ever be while he was still living with his wife .
i know i deserve better - every human being deserves better than that '.
this is what i am finding so difficult now .
person @-@ one - ' leave him , tell his wife what he 's been up to ( some might disagree but i think she deserves to know what she 's married to ) and never look back .
' i could not do this , there would be nothing to be gained by telling her , apart from causing a lot of hurt , and making me look like iwant some kind of revenge , which i do n't .
regardless of the moral aspect , you are putting all the decision making power of this relationship in his hands .
to redress the balance , you can leave him and move on .
take back your independance .
if he really wants to be with you , he will make it happen .
i very much doubt he will do anything other than moan to you about your decision though ( so be prepared and stay strong ) .
so really , the best thing for you to do is leave him and move on .
there are plenty of lovely , single guys out there ( and any married man playing the field does n't fit my definition of lovely , so do take off your rose tinted glasses too ) .
as peachy said my friend is in the situation where he may shortly make the decision to leave his wife for his girlfriend , she is in a relationship with somebody who she does not love and they have not slept together for a long time , and believe me they are in love but regarding the op she must make her own decision and go along with it
quote :
the existence of __quant1__ ( presumably ) youngish children would suggest that the marriage is not the cold and unrewarding one the husband would have you believe .
the oldest child is at university , the youngest will be starting __value1__ levels this year
you have no evidence whatsoever that his home life is barren and unhappy .
if it was so desperate , so stultifying , so lacking in affection , he would have told her and taken steps to end the marriage ...
for his own sake !
perhaps , but perhaps not
if you think she just needs the gentlest of nudges to decide that the marriage is n't worth salvaging , why not drop her a line and ask her what she thinks about the present situation and how best to resolve the difficulties .
it 's not my place to tell her and nor would i , under any circumstances
if he wants to end the marriage and be with me , then that 's his decision
quote :
you 're right i do have conflicting feelings .
i can n't carry on as i am , so i do need to know what his long term intentions are .
i might not like the answer , but i know i do have to find out .
good luck with that .
he can tell you anything he thinks will keep you pacified .
quote :
leaving aside the morality of affairs for a moment , i wonder how you could be happy being treated this way by any man .
it seems to me that you fit in around his life , when it suits him then you can meet up ?
we meet when it is convenient to both of us if it is n't too personal a question , what do you do ?
find a room ?
nope , as i have said before we have n't been up to much of that .
the few times it has happened has been when he 's visiting me and there 's been no one in at my house i 'm sorry but from here it all seems a little tawdry - do n't you deserve better than this ?
yes , and i 'd like more than that too
as for affairs , well , my mum had one when i was __quant1__ and left my dad .
i was devastated at the time - called her some names that even now i blush to recall but with the benefit of maturity and some distance i can see that it was the best decision for all concerned .
my mum married the other man and stayed with him until he died .
my dad met a lovely woman and also remarried .
my sister and me , after a tumultuous month or __quant1__ , got on with our lives .
affairs do cause a lot of emotional upheaval and unhappiness but the long term outcome does n't necessarily need to be a bad one .
i 'm pleased your parents went on to live happy lives with their new partners
quote :
good luck op , not everyone on here thinks youre a deluded sti ridden harlot who is trying to steal someone elses man .
i hope things work out for you and you find happiness whatever decision you make
thank you
i do n't mean to be dense , but why do you have to find out what his long term intentions are ?
what are yours ?
__quant1__ would be more concerned with his short term intentions to be honest , you could spend __quant1__ listening to excuses and waiting for him to leave .
are you really happy with the possibilty of waiting for all that time only to be in the exact same position __quant1__ from now ?
if you want to be with him you do have to lay your cards on the table , you have to mean it too and be prepared to walk away if he is n't commited to leaving his marriage in the near future .

my husband had a three and a half year affair .
he promised her the world , and on the basis of this , she had his baby .
he did n't leave me , had no intentions of doing so .
she was a convenient physical repository , someone to talk to , someone who thought that the __name1__ shone out of his backside , and he basked in the adulation .
when push came to shove , he chose to stay with me .
i chose to allow him to do so .
i did , however , keep in contact with his mistress , as much to get answers to my myriad of questions as to keep an eye on her .
( she was so smitten that she turned down a chance to emigrate to __name1__ and made a million and one excuses for him when heir child died without him even bothering to visit her ) and , funnily enough , she was shocked when i told her of the affairs he had following the demise of their relationship ; she truly thought that she was the one , rather than a convenience .
i am heart sorry for you .
quote :
i have been following this post due to the situation i found myself in .
bit of background
going through a divorce · __quant1__ children
i had been with my husband for over 20+ years when end of last year , he announced he dont love me know more and was leaving .
he didnt leave that night as he didnt know how to tell the children .
about __quant1__ week later the phone bill arrived and there was a number __quant2__ didnt recognised that he had been contacting from the time he got up till the time we went to bed , for months .
when i confronted him he told me it was a woman from work who was a close friend .
he told the children and left that night .
he moved into his parents and within a few weeks he was sleeping with her .
at first i had the support of his parents but that soon diminished .
as obv they stood by their son .
roll on too now .
i cant describe to you the hurt and humiliation that you feel .
that everyone knew and was laughing at you , to watch my children crumble before your very eyes , the man they used to look at with such admiration they look at with contempt .
i dont slag him off in front of the children or refuse to allow him contact .
he chooses not to see them unless he can be bothered .
to listen to your kids crying at night as they have been replaced by her children .
yes he is still with her .
are they happy i have no clue .
he tells the children he lives with his parents and his parent keep this up he infact stays over every night at her house .
the children do not want to meet her under any circumstances .
so he has to live a lie im not sure if the kids will ever meet her or be told the truth as to where he his living .
we have lost family members that we were very close to how can those trelationships ever be put right .
i try my best to keep going and hold my head up high and keep letting the kids know that they are loved .
but you end up living on your nerves as you are never quite sure whats going to be thrown at you next .
my husband had never been unfaithful before she knew he was married with children as she had met us .
i suspect he has told her he was unhappy etc. maybe he was but we were still intimate right up until he left ( do you think he told her that ) .
we had plans for the future and were discussing how to make those plans a reality .
so for all you know he could be doing the same to his wife .
i was totally devasted and to some extent still am .
would i have believed that he was capable of causing so much hurt and devastation .
never .
he is now not the man i was with for all of those years i dont even recognise him or his actions .
it makes you wonder if the whole of your life has been __quant1__ big lie .
so yes his wife has the right to know i wish someone had told me that he was flirting with someone else whilst making promises to me .
then i wouldnt have felt that he had ripped my heart out of my chest and stamped on it .
i would have been prepared for the whole of my life and my kids lives to be turned upside down but most of all i would have had a choice in the outcome .
purpletoenails - read that post above and really take in the pain this always causes and be ashamed of yourself .
a married man is out of bounds and you should have walked away double quick , no excuses .
women like you disgust me .
and i know this because my ex ripped my heart out the day i gave birth to our beautiful little girl .
he moved out and in with her whilst i was in hospital .
roll on nearly __quant1__ years and they got married , had a baby and now he has done exactly the same to her and is living with the next victim .
be warned ...
( and i think i 'll duck now before i get shot down in flames !
quote :
if he did n't leave pretty much immediately , he probably won't at all .
i agree with this .
it also has to be his choice to leave .
the relationship can work out and often does .
its the reason the marriage is unhappy that needs to be addressed or there is a good chance of repeating the same problems and being unhappy all over again .
quote :
yes it can , no denying that , but people get hurt as a result of affairs .
people get hurt for all sorts of reasons and my experience is genuine people dont embark on an affair in a foolhardy fashion it is done with care and consideration of everyone involved .
they slip into it and dont run into it and it happens because they are not happy in their marriage .
some people look to repairing the marriage and some people cant .
blame doesnt help .
quote :
i think it is actually quite straight forward really .
he is either totally sincere , totally confused at what is happening to him , trully totally in love with you , and the only truthful reason why he is still with his wife is because he can n't bear not seeing his children regularly any longer .
this , unfortunately , although possible , is not the most likely case .
however , if it is , he most likely would not be waiting until seeing you again to discuss what you have said to you .
he would be calling you , telling you that he has been thinking of what you 've said every day , that he understand how you feel and know how totally unfair it is for you to be put in the situation you are in , and that he has decided either to set you free and stop the relationship because there is no way he can take the chance not to have regular contact with his children any longer , or , that he has decided that he could n't keep expecting you to accept the situation as it is and therefore decided to leave his wife there and then .
or ....
he does care very much for you , even probably trully love you , however , not enough to be prepared to leave not just his kids , but maybe the wife who despite what he might say , actually also still love very much , or worse , not leave the comfort that comes with the relationship , or lose out financially through the divorce she will ask for , all the money he worked very hard to earn .
however , despite what you told him , he does n't want to lose what he has with you , and so is most likely to wait until you are meeting again to discuss the conversation , likely to wait until you bring it up again , and likely to give a sob story about how much he loves you , does n't want to lose you and therefore he has decided to leave his wife , however , he needs to sort out a few things before he does it officially .
he will try to keep you hanging on for how long as possible , probably already knowing that the time has come for this arrangement to end , but trying to keep it going and enjoying it for how long as it can last because you start to realise that he trully never intend to leave .
__quant1__ sure thing , you need to separate his feelings for you from the actions he is capable of taking .
even if he does love you as much as you believe he does , it does n't mean he is trully prepared to leave for many reasons ...
even more afraid of any confrontations with his wife than he loves you , even more attached to his financial stability than he loves you , even more concern about his status and what people think of him than he loves you ...
in the end , you are now at the stage where his love his not enough , what you need is action , this means things changing now , when he might decide that a good compromise is just to make promises ...
that was a great post thank you
any or all of the above could be true .
quote :
so what will you say & do if he does say he does n't know ?
that 's the easy way out for him , is n't it ?
he does n't have to make a decision and he 'll hope that things just drift on as before .
it was you who posted that you were getting fed up of things as they are .
do you have the courage to walk away ?
yes , i 'm really hoping that i have

is n't it exciting , she can walk away , leave things as they be or stage a takeover bid .
i hope the rest of the thread contains some comment on the morality of this .
quote :
do n't see what is so ' exciting ' about all this , i find it all quite unfortunate · the position of all parties involved .
morals are not popular !
quote :
i think most of the posts have been highly critical of the op actually .
i have my own moral standards but prefer not to make judgement on others in these circumstances .
everybody seems to be trying to up the ante and make this more stressful for the op.
i 'm just looking at it in a different way .
why make oneself ill over something that is part of life .
i think in some respects that is why we are where we are with societal decline .
moral standards in certain areas are not subjective .
adultery is wrong , no if 's or buts , simply , ...
wrong .
if you fall out of love with your partner , if you fall in love with someone else , do the decent thing , leave them , then do what you have to .
be honest , do n't lie , do n't cheat .
being judgmental is not always a negative trait .
quote :
i agree with you but do n't think ' exciting ' is appropriate terminology in the circumstances .
my mum died of cancer last __month1__ and i can n't cope without her .
she was my best friend and we did everything together .
__quant1__ saw her all the time and we spoke about 6 times __quant1__ day on the phone up until she was very ill in her last weeks and sleepy with morphine .
i have suffered from anxiety and depression in the past and she was the one person who could calm me down and make everything alright .
yesterday i was due to have an operation to remove my gallbladder and i was actually at the hospital and booked in when i told them i was feeling unwell and left .
i am so scared of having the operation and imagine all the horrible things that could go wrong , i had an op once before but mum was helping me cope with my nerves and helped me go through it .
yesterday i just kept thinking i need mum , i can n't do it without her .
it 's so stupid because i will still have to have it done and she won't be there .
i sit at home during the day and cry and cry . i hold my hands together and keep praying she will come back , i say over and over again " please come back , please come back " like it will make a difference but i know it can n't happen , i just want a miracle .
my husband tries so much to help and is so kind but it is n't the same and i 'm scared of stressing him out .
the night before i was due my operation i was in such a state and he was trying to calm me and i saw his eyes were bloodshot .
he has high blood pressure and i thought " omg i 'm going to end up killing him "
my kids are wonderful but my misery stresses them out , i really really try to hid it but they hear me blowing my nose alot and notice my eyes are red .
i have been on meds ( __name1__ ) in the past but they make me feel really weird and i do n't like taking them .
i go to a counsellor which is great when i 'm with her but when i 'm alone i start feeling low again .
i hate myself for being so stupid and not coping .
i 'm an adult , and a wife and a mum .
i know what a stress and misery i am for my family to be around , but i do n't believe i will ever get better without mum here to help me .
i miss her so so much , i need her back , i can n't believe she has gone forever - it is n't possible .
i 'm so desperate i just do n't know what to do , i want to hide in a corner and pretend none of this is happening .
please please can someone tell me how to cope , or even just hold up for my family .
your anchor has been ripped away and you are cut adrift on a stormy sea .
under the circumstances , when you were so very close this is completely understandable .
it 's very difficult to manage without someone who was so important in our lives .
if the grief and loss is having an overwhelming impact on your life , then i suggest that you consider a different grief @-@ couseller to try to learn how you can cope better and move forward to a happier life without her .
if she were here with you now do you think she would want you to be so very unhappy ?
you are not stupid !
you are suffering terribly and you need different help .
i lost my mum and i felt the same way , for quite a long time , so i think i understand how it is for you .
there is a good future and you will recover .
you will

go and see your gp and see if he @/@ her has an alternative
angel , you do n't need to hide the pain or hold up for your family .
they can cope seeing your pain because they are stronger than you think .
your husband sounds lovely , lean on him .
hard
so sorry for your loss and feeling so sad .
i agree that you need to see the gp and try some counselling .
i had my gallbladder removed last __month1__ , keyhole surgery .
i feel much better now , had to stay in hospital __quant1__ days longer due to infection and having a drain but __quant2__ month later __quant2__ could eat a lot more food and felt physically better .
sending lots of love x
it might be an idea to see your gp as a matter of some urgency .
at the moment you 're catastrophising everything , and it does n't have to be like that .
i did n't want to read and run hun .
definitely go back to your doctor , try and get some grief counselling , do n't be afraid to lean on people for help .
i do hope that you can find some comfort soon xxx
you 're not stupid !
it 's not stupid that you 're missing your mum , it 's perfectly understandable .
you 're overwhelmed .
you need to talk to your gp again .
do you talk to anyone about how you 're feeling or are you bottling it up , trying to look like you 're managing to cope with it all ?
i 'm sure your children are worried about you and i 'm sure they 'd appreciate you telling them how you 're feeling , rather than them fretting because they 're seeing their mum upset .
maybe they do n't realise just how much it 's affecting you , the same with your husband , and if they knew i 'm sure they 'd try and help you more .

i have to say that as i read your post i had tears in my eyes .
my own mum has cancer , in her breast __quant1__ years ago and unfortunately we were told in __month1__ that it had returned in her bones .
i have the same relationship with my mum as you have with yours and thinking of my life without her reduces me to tears on __quant1__ basis .
she too is on morphine and we have good days and bad .
i wont offer you any advice as i know that when the time comes i will suffer in exactly the same way as you are now .
what i will say however is try to stay strong and think how sad your mum would be to see you so distressed .
if shes anything like mine she will want you to remember her with fondness as you move on with your life , making her proud of the person you have become which is all thanks to her x
stay strong x
hi i completely know where your coming from i too lost my mum to cancer at the age of __quant1__ , it was a very short illness diagnosed in the __month1__ and she passed on __day1__ st __month2__ 08 .
my mum too was my right arm went everywhere together __quant1__ phoned her every day .
i was dumbfounded that my mum was gone just like that .
i cried for my mum but i do n't think i 've ever grieved properly as i had my dad , brother and my __quant1__ young children who were __quant2__ and __quant3__ at the time and i had to be strong for them .
moving on __quant1__ years and i am now suffering from anxiety @/@ panic attacks and have been quite ill for the past __value1__ @-@ __value2__ months , the dr thinks it could all be down to my loss as since my mums passing i 've lost my nan , grandad , __quant2__ uncles and my beautiful __quant3__ day old niece .
i 'm currently having counselling and i 'm hoping this works .
i think you need to stick with your counselling and it sounds like you have a very understanding husband so lean on him all you can .
big hugs the day to day things do get easier but the pain of loss never goes away , just be assured that your mum is always with you and loves you very much .

they have relacated our office three times in __quant1__ years now , and i have to travel 1 hour 15 minutes morning and evening .
i too have __quant1__ children , and do all the drop off @/@ pick ups , as organising the holidays and everything else relating to them .
my partner is not their dad and their dad is useless , so can n't help that much .
like you , i am absolutely shattered and feel i have no life , and i too feel bitter that i do n't get to enjoy our money because once everything is paid , we do n't have that much disposable income .
i know it might sound incredible to many , but it is the reality .
once we have paid the mortage , the bills , childcare ( no help ) , there is n't that much left .
the main reason is that we are repaying our mortgage so that we have paid everything in __quant1__ years .
that 's my partner 's decision , not mine , it does cause issues in our relationship , but it is one thing my partner won't buldge on .
i see his point , i just wish we could enjoy our money more .
like you , holidays are at family homes abroad , and like you , although i am grateful for it , it is more a resting holiday than an exciting one .
__quant1__ look at the cost of everything when __quant1__ do my __quant1__ shopping at __name1__ , i now shop exclusively in charity shops , my children only get clothes from supermarkets and only when they are on sale !
__quant1__ go to get my hair done two or three times __quant1__ year , have never had a manicure , padicure , self tan or whatever else you can spend your money on !
like you , my friends either do n't work or only work part @-@ time and seem to enjoy a lot more things that i do , and i to wonder some time how they do it , although i know for a couple of them , they received quite a decent inheritance , others are quite into debts , and others have remortgage their house many time .
so ok , we are more responsible , but i am not sure it is so worth it .
i can n't give up my job .
so for anyone who reads how wonderful life would be earning over £45k , believe me , if you live in the se , once you 've paid for your taxes and receiving nothing back , you are not as rich as you might think .
of course you have the luxury of not having to worry how you going to put food on the table or pay the next electricity bill , but you usually do n't get where you are without having worked very hard for it , and the exhaustion that can come with what such a salary entails is not always worth it .
as i said above , as you have n't read the whole thread you might be unaware that the op 's salary from her full time job sits untouched in the bank each month - so your circumstances on the surface seem similar but if you were in her situation __quant1__ think you might think ' stuff the job ' would you not ?
quote :
resenting part time & sahm is ridiculous .
you & your husband have made your choices & now you have to live with them .
obviously paying off the mortgage quickly is far more important than quality of life .
most part time & sahms make lots of sacrifices to be with their children .
unfortunately resentment , along with jealousy , bitterness and anger , is one of those emotions we can n't help feeling !
telling people not to feel the way they do is pretty much one of the most unhelpful things you can do !
quote :
also , as this poster did n't read the whole thread they will be unaware that the ops __quant1__ wage sits untouched in the bank , so their situations are not so similar after all !
actually , our situations are very similar .
i could n't believe how similar they are , in fact .
my main salary sits in the bank because i have n't got mortgage yet to pay off so i am not spending it .
but if we are to take out the mortgage we are aiming for repaying it in full would amaizingly too take us __quant1__ years ( honestly , i did calculations ) .
that 's what i was thinking of doing too .
[ quote=make me wise ; 44480052]did anyone ; family , friends , teachers etc ever praise you as a child op ?
not just when you achieved something , but along all the little steps it took to acomplish something .
my view is that you dont seem to look at how much you have achieved and feel a sense of pride in yourself .
quote ]
actually no , they did n't .
my mum wanted me to achieve a lot and __value1__ was a straight a student , from school year __value1__ up until graduation from university .
she used to say that for me to get a b is worse than to get a d. so i guess i am indeed a perfectionist .
sadly , my mum has passed away already a few years back ( as has my dad ) , both in their early fifties .
and i think the reason i am trying so hard might be because they would expect me to do well in life so i am still trying to make them proud .
to be perfectly honest , it is killing me to think that i am not living up to my mum 's expectations , whatever they were .
quote :
can i ask op , what sort of wealth did your family have growing up ?
is this a case of not having much and trying to build it all up in __quant1__ generation ?
or is it a case of trying to match the level of your parents but with different incomes ?
i went to a state school but it was selective .
i come from a middle @-@ class family but after my parents divorced life became more difficult financially .
we were never poor as such but it was difficult for mum .
since then i am terrified of having no money .
so the mere thought of having savings in the bank makes me feel content .
i guess that 's part of the reason why we did so well saving up 90k .
[ quote=despera ; 44498082 ] quote :
did anyone ; family , friends , teachers etc ever praise you as a child op ?
then this is what you need help with .
go get counselling , i am sure that your parents would have been proud of you whatever you acheived , only it looks like they never got a chance to tell you this .
i reckon this is the issue you need help with .
when you have paid your mortgage you are still going to feel this way unless you get some help for your feelings .
when you get your £500k house , it 'll still not be good enough because you have these unresolved issues .
sorry if this is not what you wanted to hear but i think you need counselling to deal with your parents death and their assumed expectations .
quote :
i really do n't understand people who have children , then insist that the children must have the best of everything , so work all the hours under the sun and moon in order to pay for *the best* when the really best thing for those children is quality time spent with their parents .
children are only children for such a very short time and they do n't need holidays in __name1__ , private education and all the other trappings that *the jones '* have .
what they need , is a parents undivided attention .
time to take them to the park , bake cakes , go splashing in puddles and days out at the seaside .
op , you have your values and priorities wrong .
there has been a lot of very good advice given to you , i really hope you take it , for the sake of your health and especially for the sake of your children .
fantastic post wish i could thank it more than once

get them charged .
on __day1__ __month1__ a few years ago me and my friend were walking up the street to catch a taxi .
we had had words with a man in a nightclub earlier , he was from __name1__ , i dont remember exactly what had happened in the nightclub but i think he had come on to my friend and she turned him down and he didnt like it .
anyway he caught up with us as we were walking to the taxi , he ended up arguing with me mainly , he went to punch me , my friend pushed me out of the way , and then he punched her in the face .
he broke her jaw in __quant1__ places , a couple of lads were across the street and they chased him but didnt manage to catch him ( they were chavs )
we went to hopsital as she was in pain and it was confirmed that she had a broken jaw , we reported it to the police and they took us in for a interview , we were interviewed seperate .
they somehow knew who we were talking about , he must have been known to them as they showed us a pic of a man and it was him .
so then we went to court , and thankfully one of the chavs had offered to be a witness as well , i was bricking it to stand up in court
but thankfully when he arrived in court too , he saw that all __quant1__ witness'es had turned up he changed his plea to guilty
he got sent to jail for __quant1__ months and the was being deported .
so its def worth reporting it
again , very different circumstances to what happened to the op 's dd . a broken jaw in an unprovoked attack with independent witnesses to give evidence is very different from " bruising " following a spat in a club that 's spilled out onto the street .
jxx
quote :
and i am sure the police ( with the help of cctv ) will investigate any attack and decide on the outcome .
quote :
i am very very suprised by the actions of the police in this case .
if a crime is committed surely they are duty @-@ bound to investigate and prosecute , rather than just leaving it up to the victim to decide ?
it 's up to the police to check cctv - that 's their job for heaven 's sake .
remember the hoo @-@ haa about the jordan rape claim a little while back ?
the police questioned her even though she was adamant she did n't want to do anything about it .
that 's what they are supposed to do - or else surely they are just allowing people to get away with stuff due to witnesses @/@ victins feeling vulnerable ?
my friend 's oh was set upon by a group of lads outside a pub in the early hours and even though he was drunk and probably behaving provocatively the police were very professional and used cctv evidence to prosecute .
his attacker got __quant1__ months and had to pay him compensation .
what they 'll often do if there 's been a melee outside a club and the person who has been assualted refuses to press charges , is charge the protagonists with a public order offence ( if they have the cctv or other solid evidence to back it up ) usually section 4 , or a more serious section 3 affray if there 's a large number of people causing trouble .
i 'm surprised by your __value1__ point though - normally when someone is sent to prison they do n't have to pay compensation as well as they would be deemed to have no way to pay it ( because they 're in prison , obviously ) .
jxx
i think any act of violence on another person needs taking seriously .
the girls would otherwise do it again and may even harm someone seriously .
my son was also subjected to an unprovoked attack in which he nearly died .
both lads went to prison " briefly " but at least they may just think twice before doing it again .
both lads had viewed a fight as part of a normal night out beforehand .
your daughter is what we call in the trade an unreliable witness .
she got thrown out of the club for some reason .
i 'm sure the club will give the police full details .
she was too drunk to give an account of what happened to the police at the time - that 's not a good starting point for a prosecution .
there are cctv pictures which may well show ( and you have to be prepared for this ) things you would rather not see - eg daughter mouthing off .
you 've only got __quant1__ side of the story .
i suspect that once the police have interviewed club staff , seen the cctv and interviewed the other parties they 'll come up with a less clear @-@ cut picture of what happened .
in fact , your daughter may find herself facing a prosecution for a public order offence .
ideally , insult their manhood until they took a swing at me then beat their asses in " self @-@ defense ."
i 'm not so self @-@ important that i need to carry a gun to protect my existence .
-@ dan motor
they would have laughed at you , just like everyone else is doing .
but it does sound like you have a good handle on your net worth as a human being .
_everybody_ else ?
i can n't take a break from laughing at you " dangerous " man .
do your gonads swell whenever you type your moniker ?
people going around shouting " fuck " are just exercising their __name1__ rights .
crap !
gulty as charged .
where did we meet , henry ?
here 's your example of a kid @-@ friendly family restaurant in a safe middle @-@ class environment :
__value1__ href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luby%27s_massacre"> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/luby%27s_massacre </a>
__name1__ has one of the most liberal gun laws in the country , yet it did little good in this case .
__name1__ was never in the bar and did n't know what had happened in there .
he was inside playing video games and had gone outside to move his car when he encountered the two .
whatever happened then is what lead up to the shooting .
after shooting he immediately called the police and waited for them .
does n't sound like somebody who just wanted to shoot __quant1__ guys for no reason .
suspicious is why __name1__ felt he needed to " move his car " at that particular time .
and john 's relative 's statement about what she overheard on the cell phone call moments before john was shot .
and the fact that john had been shot through the windshield of his car .
and that both victims were unarmed .
but still , i see your point about reasonable doubt .
actually it does n't and they were far less liberal at the time of the shooting .
thus they changed them after the shooting .
__name1__ remains one of a handful of states that bans open carry and requires guns to be concealed .
do you ever wonder why the people __name1__ employed felt able to behave for __quant1__ in such a way ?
they smeared the careers of __name1__ 's opponents in the __name2__ , leaking information about private lives etc. but you are sure brown himself " behaved properly ".
might be worth googling the word " deniability ".
bosque , will you stop doing that , as i nearly had a heart attack .
i thought i was going mad and written something totally different to what i thought i had .
but no !
i went back to check , and i did indeed say :
i have no idea whether __name1__ was blameless .
the only thing we can say is that he appears to have behaved properly in as far as we can tell .
i 'm not sure how "...
having no idea..."
and "...
appears..."
is anything like being "...
sure.."
steve w
with specific regards to his child 's health , there have been rumblings for the last few hours that no hacking occured and that a " friend " leaked the information .
link please .
that 's certainly not what __name1__ is saying :
__name3__ bbc __name1__ gordon __name2__ news international tactics </a>
steve w
nothing concrete yet @- <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/user?screen_name=tombradby&original_referer=http://order-order.com/"> just rumblings </a> .
as i said , this is the only thing in a storm of flying muck , that is being refuted and there must be a reason for it .
__quant1__ recalls __name1__ attended __name2__ ' wedding weeks after __name3__ broke their front page story about his child
i 'm not sure why __name1__ is still in her job .
__name1__ ran an interview last night with __name2__ 's biographer explaining it is a very tight knit familial group .
he offered an anecdote that __name1__ quit smoking after losing a bet with __name2__ over who would win a swimming race .
quite they sacrificed __name1__ to save executives and may well drop all their __name2__ newspaper holdings to protect the company
no @-@ one is taking responsibility .
not __name1__ or some other executive .
not assistant commissioner __name1__ or another figure .
round and round we go
a bit of a feeble response , i have to say .
completely agree .
__name1__ & __name2__ are small beer to this lot .
your going to protect the tv side of the business , 10m people in this country coughing up a minimum of £20 __quant1__ month .
veteran __name2__ correspondent __name1__ on __name3__ · - <a __name4__ fisk : why i had to leave the times __value1__ press __value1__ media __name5__ independent </a>
yes , you 're right , of course .
steve w
for me , the sickest things of all ( regarding __name1__ 's son ) is n't the hacking , it 's ( a ) that __name2__ thought this was a story in the public interest , and that ( b ) we live in a country where people buy a newspaper that saw fit to print the story .
steve w
are you insufficiently repulsed by __name2__ 's mysteriously @-@ obtained exclusive on __name1__ 's son 's cystic fibrosis ?
do n't worry - like everything about the hacking scandal , there are always more details to emerge to compound the horror .
i 've been speaking to a source close to __name1__ at the time of the story , who recalls that it was served up with a chaser of threat .
" __name1__ insisted - despite a heavy brow @-@ beating from __name3__ - that he was not willing to let his son 's medical condition be __name2__ stuff of a __name2__ exclusive , " recalls this source .
" so he put out a statement on pa to spike their scoop and make clear that despite his condition , fraser was fit and healthy .
__name1__ were utterly furious , and __name3__ 's communications team were told that if gordon wanted to get into __name2__ , he needed to learn that was not how things were done ."
yes , how dare the then @-@ chancellor refuse to accept that his child 's health was not technically a commercial __name1__ property ?
i 'd like to tell you there 's a sick bag located in the rear pocket of the seat in front of you .
but i 'm afraid you 're on your own .
__name1__ is probably the most despicable female this country has seen since myra hindley .
worse than __name1__ and maxine carr you reckon
your posts do n't get any better mate , seriously .
it may have been an overstatement , by the op , but she 's probably not lept several places upwards on most people 's __name1__ card lists in the last week .
steve w
we have n't got to the bottom of this yet .
seriously steve , when it comes to tabloids as a whole .
i would n't put it past the __name2__ looing into __name1__ 's kids medical history .
i think all this lot operate in a very shady way , i believe that will become apparent if they widen the net and move beyond just __name1__ 's operation .
i liked that video about the building #13 store somebody posted earlier .
but i have to ask..
is n't there something in the __name1__ regulating stuff like this , especially when it comes to food ?
in that video the guy showed rusty cans of food , eating the contents could probably make you very seriously ill .
a store like this would n't survive in my country , as it would get closed down by state inspectors .
does n't something like this exist in the __name1__ ?
__quant1__ remember a supermarket in my area having to close down for a few weeks , their only crime was having freezers not quite up to spec .
edit : oh also , as an amusing side note , we had __name1__ here for a while but they completely tanked , gave up , and sold their stores to local chains .
i went into a walmart here once and it was pretty much the most confusing experience i ever had .
in the __name1__ food manufacturing and preparation is regulated but food retailing is not .
so , any store that prepares food on @-@ site for sale ( like a grocery store with a bakery , deli , or meat counter ) would be inspected by the local health department but stores that stock only pre @-@ packaged foods are unregulated .
i can n't stop laughing at those __name1__ dolls .
too bad the same cannot be said for __name1__ .
okay , is it just me , or is there an epidemic lately on these forums of people going on about how things are where they live , but never actually mentioning where the hell it is that they live ?
am i missing something here ?
is a poster 's location listed somewhere obvious and i 'm just missing it ?
i 'm sorry to call you out in particular as you are only one of many , many people who do this lately , but goddamn is it annoying to me .
am i alone here ?
i do inventory and ordering at a __name1__ .
i can tell you right off that we have a __name2__ __name1__ tape ($ __quant1__ ) , a __name4__ __name3__ game ($ __quant2__ ) ( plus several other __name5__ @/@ __name6__ gba games ) , a pack of __name8__ __name7__ cards .
i 'll see if i can find anymore weird stuff and take pictures of it .
also a package of __name1__ boxers that has been there since __year1__ ( assuming it 's been there since the date written on it ) .
still rings up $ __quant1__ and it 's yellowed now .
dead pikachu fucked around with this message at mar __day1__ , __year1__ around __time1__ @:@ __time1__
the local __name1__ has had a giant __quant1__ mb flash drive behind the photo counter marked at $ __quant2__ for at least __quant3__ years now .
found a __quant1__ gb external hard drive for $ __quant2__ in the clearance section at my __name1__ @-@ __name1__ today .
working at a __name1__ @-@ __name1__ in the __name2__ region i can tell you corporate has basically given up on that store as well as the [ url=http://www.walmart.com/storelocator/ca_storefinder_details_short.do?rx_dest=%2findex.gsp&rx_title=com.wm.

we won't send employees there even if they ask .
we also warn all customers away from it ...
as politely as possible .
favorite story from the __name1__ one is we had someone go over there to try to get their electronics department up to shape .
it was so bad the person we sent over walked over to the camera case took all the cameras out of the unlocked case ( its never supposed to be unlocked ) and put them in a box behind the photo counter and waited · ...
and waited · ...
and __quant1__ hours later someone noticed .
that store is a loving cesspool .
work downtown .
i was bored one day so i figured i would head down to stealyard at lunch and see what new __name1__ items were in stock .
bought a few thing , the scalpers clear the rack here( __name1__ ) every tuesday morning .
so anyways i was pretty pleased with my finds until that __quant1__ pound lady felt the need to practically strip search me before i could leave , with armed guard behind her .
have n't been back , lower taxes out here anyways .
since we seem to have a couple locals reading this thread .
head over to b.a. sweeties on __name1__ rd . for your racist candy fix .
serious if you like candy and have n't been there .
it 's almost as if our country ( the __name1__ ) is way behind the rest of the civilized world or something .

the only time i ever made it to __name1__ , we came up to buy some seeds .
goooooood stuff ....
i was really surprised how professional and not seedy ( hah

i was expecting to meet some dirty guy in shades in an alley somewhere , and that was n't the case at all .
i love __name1__ ...
it 's so clean !
right now , i 'm mostly for legalizing because the medical marijuana crap just is n't working , and that pisses me off .
right now my dad is off in __name1__ .
he 's a " care provider " for " patients " that have medical problems that can n't be cured other ways supposedly .
all this winds up being is my stoned ass dad , sitting around selling weed semi @-@ legally to a bunch of people with ridiculous health complaints ( i have a sore knee !
i can n't function ! ) the abuse of the medical marijuana laws in __name1__ are really starting to upset a lot of people .
__quant1__ " clinic " in __name1__ was firebombed a while back .
it 's all such a giant joke .
so the solution : legalize it for everyone , so we can all stop pretending that we have ulcers and crap , use the tax to fix the world , and lets all get on with it .
who cares about weed really ?
what 's the big deal ?
has anyone ever really heard of a guy going out and smoking too much , and then going home to beat his wife ?
or breaking into someones house and stealing their stereo for more weed money ?
does n't happen .
i would rather be on the highway next to a person who is blazed out of their skull than someone who had __quant1__ too many at the bar .
now then .
i used to smoke .
a lot .
too much .
i 'm going to get into trouble here-- i 've been high around my kids .
i did n't smoke around them , but i was high when i came home .
a lot of times , i 'm just stressed out and annoyed by my kids .
i want to rush them off into bed just to get some peace and quiet .
but when i 've smoked a little , i 'm a great mom .
i 'm happy to sit down and play silly games with them .
i do n't yell .
i can find ways to explain their endless silly questions and it does n't get on my nerves .
i can see them for the beautiful little miracles that they really are .
i guess i 'm just mentioning this , because smoking weed does n't necessarily make you a " bad mom ".
sometimes it can help you be better .
these days , i do n't seek it out .
i do n't have a problem if i 'm out with friends at the bar , or at a concert and it finds me .
but i know my limits , and if i had it around all the time , it goes badly for me .
i keep a healthy distance , i guess .
there was a couple here a while back who put their baby in an oven and left it there overnight ( didnt turn the oven on ) ...
they blamed it on the weed they had smoked ...
however , im not buying that excuse !
quote :
babies start in an " oven " so maybe they thought it was a good idea to put it back .....
a couple years ago i always had fun smoking pot .
now it just makes my anxiety really bad..
what gives ? ?
i 'm for it .
my mom came to visit during my wedding .
she smokes 24 @/@ 7 .
i was scared to death my neighbors would call the police .
i yelled at her everytime she said " pot " out loud .
i also almost had a heart attack when she decided to light a joint in the car in the middle of my town in front of everyone .
haha i 'm super paranoid , i 'd rather it just be legal .
i think it is a silly crime .
i think i posted that one .
i think it was shitty parenting @- not the weed at fault .
it still has to be used with some responsibility @- just like any mind altering drug .
like fpf said @- __quant1__ hit would make me silly and play with my kid more .
getting stoned out of my mind would have to happen when james is sleeping over my mother in laws house for the night .

umm what is the marshmallow game ? !
that game where kids have a contest to see who can stuff the most marshmallows in their mouth at once .
a lot of kids have died from choking and not being able to spit it out because their mouths are full of marshmallows .
also , i 'm really surprised that so many people agree with me !

ok im going to reply to different people on here in __quant1__ part .
when i stated " retards ", you all must be pot heads or you wouldnt of took offense to that , i wasnt pointing my finger at __quant1__ certain person , i meant people that are like what i was saying in my previous post .
its funny how you think i was being mean and my words are needed to be more tasteful ....
have you people even read the ones that commented on my __value1__ post ?
not only was i called names in them but as soon as i say iam against legalize of it , i get put down like everything i said was wrong .
its called a opinion , you dont like it , dont read it and ignore it .
you all have your opinion , and thats fine .
i will not " live through " my kids , as someone said something of the sort , to what i should of did .
i was a very good teenager growing up , i had a protective mother .
i didnt drink , do drugs , sneak out , sleep around .
i had morals .
so if my kids grow up similar to me , i have no problem .
i did drink when i was __quant1__ now and then and when i was __quant3__ i drank alot for about __quant2__ months .
i had went through alot .
sure alcohol can damage you if you are a alcoholic , but so can other things .
i have seen people all messed up from drugs and weed .
for someone that made a certain comment , dont tell me what i have or havnt fuckin seen .
my husband 's mother was a drug addict half his life , his aunts , his step @-@ father .
and they sold .
he grew up never doing that , not even pot .
iam very protective of my children cause i know the kind of people out there , i wont let my mother in law take them by herself cause i dont know what she will be doing at her home with my kids around .
even though they are supposedly not doing anything .
iam not naive , nor sheltered .
to someone who was __quant1__ and said they knew more or something like that ...
get real .
i have been through a hell of alot with certain things and you will never know what i know or am educated about .
iam not going to tell my kids its bad for you and thats that .
i will tell them why and educate them on it .
they will be the ones to make thier own decisions in life , and hopefully they are the right ones .
my kids will be good kids though , iam not a parent that lets them do whatever they want and not be there for them .
they are thier own person and iam there just to guide them .
they might be angels they might not , but i got 4 of them i raise , so i know alot more about kids then some of you .
iam not a idiot , get the fuck off your high pedastal ....
now that dear was rude .
all of you that are commenting on my post are taking this personally , and you must be pot heads or something cause you wouldnt give a shit , its ridiculous .
iam not naming one person out , iam saying certain people , and its all my opinion .
if you dont like it , then you dont have to respond .
iam against it , thats all .
nothing more to be said .
i am going to address one point , and one point only .
if you had not been insulting in your original response , i probably would n't have even responded to you .
i know that people disagree with my stance , and i respect that .
but people tend to get defensive if you insult them .
do n't insult me and i will treat you with respect .
call me a low life bum , and i have lost all respect for you .
i just do n't understand why you have the attack language turned on is all .
fast forward several years , and now not only do __quant2__ still not get the respect of the people who make $ 250k+/yr . but people born with a golden spoon in their mouths , who contribute nothing to society , that get high @-@ paying jobs because of connections by their parents , nothing to do with what they know get more respect than somebody like me who worked himself so far to the bone that __quant1__ am now suffering from chronic stomach problems and ulcers , for possibly the rest of my life because of the overstress that i have to deal with .
that relatively ubiquitous sense of snobbery by the rich , as well as ( more importantly ) they 're not technically working significantly harder than any other members of society ( and the poorest members often work harder , given their execrable jobs ) , is why i 'm very happy with progressive taxation .
i was told that back in __year1__ , programmers @/@ engineers were being paid on average roughly twice what the average programmer @/@ engineer is being paid now .
not to mention their hours were easier .
__quant1__ know somebody working as a web developer in a small company for $ 14/hr . it 's sad when you see that and apparently so many have seen it , that the college of business at my university has been seeing a huge spike in their attendance increase because " that 's the only way you can make something of yourself nowadays ".
the six @-@ figure dream starts there and ends there now .
everyone else has taken too much of a dip .
it 's the dot com bust .
people took their money out of that and went into real estate .
then the government screwed around with that .
examples : teaching you could get to $ 100k/yr in __name1__ ...
used to , if you had experience since the __name1__ era and had a master 's or doctorate .
i heard with the exception of __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ and __name4__ , it 's still like this in the other __quant1__ states .
now __quant1__ dunno many teachers who make more than $ 75 @-@ 80k/yr . from my old high school due to ed cuts .
but they get a lot of time off , too .
one of my friends is a teacher , and she takes a lot of trips .
so if you 've seen why my tirades have gone so much against conservatives during my time here last year , that 's why . the $ __quant1__ mark is roughly __value1__ % .
i know __name1__ belongs to this elite __value1__ % , but i do not .
i had said in another board that i would make a vow to consistently get to the $ 250k mark before i died , even if it killed me , so that they have no purpose to call me " lazy " or " entitled ".
i do n't direct those tirades at cfers , or cfers in the __name1__ .
i direct them at __name1__ partiers i know who are like this and talk show hosts @/@ politicians who subscribe to this way of thinking since my chances of actually saying it to their face are near zero .
so i just hope __name1__ or __name2__ slips into cf one day , finds my tirade , and then goes bananas over it .
__name1__ has a bit of an ego .
so does __name1__ .
sometimes i listen because they 're less annoying that the stupid __name1__ radio stations that drive me up the wall .
i live in a __quant1__ @-@ bedroom apartment .
the other complaint i heard from my parents and other peers from the __name1__ are why do n't i get a house .
simple .
i do n't feel like getting one right now .
the market is n't going to go up for at least __quant1__ @-@ __quant2__ years for houses i feel .
and i want to wait until i can move my g/f to __name1__ from __name2__ before we do anything like that .
yeah , it makes sense in your situation .
i live in a __quant1__ bedroom house .
it 's small , but for me , it makes more sense than renting because i 've got a steady job where i 'll likely be employed for a while .
i got my house from a guy who used to be a stock broker , then retired from that and started a non @-@ profit to build affordable houses .
__quant1__ was making $ 33k/yr at that time .
he advised me to buy a house because he thinks that inflation is going to start hitting .
i 've got a fixed rate mortgage that got bought by __name1__ ( gag ) so hopefully i 'm set .
i love __name1__ .
the comparison between him and the other __quant1__ guys on the __name1__ regular lineup ( __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ ) are amazing .
i have recommended him to even liberals who just want a different outlook .
he has such an intellectual explanation of everything and i am so glad that he is a local .
i 'd love to meet him and shake his hand for at least trying to give an explanation for many of the outlandish remarks , and at many points refuting the more extreme views of the __name1__ .
if you get a chance , you should listen to __name1__ .
when i worked security to put myself through college , i got a chance to listen to his show and i really liked it .
if you have a sarcastic sense of humor you should listen to __name1__ .
thanks panzer .
this was why i felt like leaving cf for a while .
i felt like it was getting too personal with me and other people , and i have conservative friends on here i do respect and wish i could get to know .
a lot of people here seem extremely nice and maybe if we had talked about lighter stuff more and a lot of this stuff less , we would n't have so many issues with " liberals are blah blah blah " or " conservatives are blah blah blah ."
liberals are wrong .
i like the no a/c idea though .
one tries .
certainly there must be a few dissidents here or there , but the majority really do believe everything they are taught .
there is no reason for them not to .
from birth they are conditioned and never hear an alternate version of anything .
very successful indoctrination .
that indoctrination of the __name1__ philosophy manifests the isolation and paranoia .
it 's a philosophy of self reliance .
one of their favorite mottos is " we have nothing to envy ".
they believe they are the pure race .
the people think __name1__ is a hell hole and that the __name2__ is a heaven .
it 's not as if these people know they are being suppressed or know that it is wrong ( besides those in the slave camps perhaps ) .
through their propaganda they wake up each morning thinking " today is when the __name1__ attacks ".
they delude themselves into thinking the suppression is simply " what needs to be done " in order to defend themselves .
despite this brainwash the __name1__ as a people are extremely humble and pleasant .
when i was visiting i was told at all times what to do .
i could not leave my guides side .
he told me who to talk to , what to eat , where to sleep , what to take photos of .
however i did get to talk to quite a few people in impromptu settings .
they are very curious about me and the world , but nothing will stray them from their brainwash .
no no way did i try to argue with them , it would be a waste and very very rude .
a few times i tried to tell them i was __name1__ ( i figured out the __name2__ word ) and some of the facial expressions were great , most did n't believe me .
thought i was __name1__ .
it was a completely bizarre but fascinating place that is very misunderstood ( not to say nothing is wrong ) .
here are my public photos if you are interested .
i even met with a __quant1__ star general at the __name1__ !
we talked and he mentioned he wanted peace with the __name1__ .
haha go figure !

ostrich farm , radioactive damage pills , martial arts training in a room with a bunch of urinals laying around ...
wow , what a trip !
is n't that the issue lisab pointed out ?
it does n't take a lot of effort to plan a tour that will only show you the rich @/@ patriotic parts of the country .
of course , they showed me what they wanted me to see , no doubt about that .
in my mind i often " joked " about what was on the other side of that hill .
however __name1__ and the other few cities i visited are quite large and you can n't stage everything .
awesome pictures , greg .
i 'm speechless at the guts that it took to go there .
i hope they finished his pyramid in time .
actually , i 'd heard a while ago that they ( in partnership with telecom giant __name1__ ) has resumed work on the __name2__ and had at least finished the exterior cladding :
__value1__ href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8306697.stm"> http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8306697.stm </a>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ryugyong_hotel#construction_resumes"> http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ryugyon...uction_resumes </a>
i forgot about that one .
they did n't finish it in time after all .
__name1__ was the front man for the military dictorship that runs __name2__ .
he had power but others have power too .
given __name1__ is so secretive it difficult know anything about the place for certain so what does all this mean -@ who knows .
any thinking on this is pure speculation .
time will tell what will happen , the __quant1__ thing we know for sure societies change when we least expect them to .
so did you buy the seal penis liquor ?
and about the monk , is he part of the __name1__ religion ?
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100229283725638&set=a.10100229278541028.2548594.26701563&type=3&l=2e56741d9f"> http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fb...3&l=2e56741d9f </a>
haha yeah , the label said it had __quant1__ kinds of penis .
i hope they meant __quant1__ kinds of seal penis !
it taste fine , like a funky whiskey .
all my aliments were cured , so it was worth it !
the monks was from a __name1__ monastery .
go figure !
i think he was the only one there , or at least the only one i saw .
thanks , but actually as a tourist it 's one of the safest places you can ever be ( in terms of crime ) .
as long as you follow an extensive rule list , ok with faking respect and having no freedom , it 's not half bad !
not sure i could drink pickled pickles
maybe the leader worship is some kind of buddism spin , not that different from the tibetan llama in theory , if not practice .
hard drugs is a political not a medical term .
did cannabis suddenly become more dangerous when it was upgraded from class __value1__ to class __value2__ ?
yes it did become more dangerous .
nationally , skunk smokers are ending up ill in hospital in record numbers , with admissions soaring __value1__ per cent .
the number of adults recorded as suffering mental illness as a result of cannabis use has risen sharply from __quant1__ in __year1__ to __quant2__ in __year2__ .
the government data shows how the damaging effects of the drug have swept across __name1__ .
hospital hotspots for cannabis abuse include __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ and __name4__ .
and , as the debate over the drug 's dangers continues , figures released by the __name1__ ( nta ) show that more than 24,500 people are in drug treatment programmes for cannabis – the highest ever .
<a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/mental-illness-soars-in-uks-skunk-hotspots-397449.html"> http://www.independent.co.uk/life-st...ts-397449.html </a>
why is __name1__ class __value1__ when it is safer than horse riding ?
because the criteria for classification as a class a drug have less to do with death rates and more to do with the fact that when it was classified as class a , it had no medicinal use and was believed to be a hallucinogen like __name1__ .
yes i am serious .
both are addictive ,
like a __value1__ air @-@ gun and a 38 calibre pistol are both lethal weapons .
a social worker for a __name1__ child @-@ welfare agency
yeah , it might be newsworthy .
because the criteria for classification as a class a drug have less to do with death rates and more to do with the fact that when it was classified as class a , it had no medicinal use and was believed to be a hallucinogen like __name1__ . why is __name2__ class __value1__ when it is safer than horse riding ?
and its fairly commonly used as a date rape drug .
you can list the traits , but just because they share the traits , that does n't mean they share them equally .
that 's a pretty basic logical fallacy that would allow you to throw sugar and chocolate into the same category !
the level of addictiveness , level of mood alteration , and level of damage are just not comparable .
in particular , alcohol is not inherrently chemically addictive .
certain people are succeptible to alcohol addiction via genetic defect , but that disease does not affect a large part of the population ( __value1__ % according to the wiki ) .
that is stakly different from hard drugs ( or even nicotine or caffiene , for that matter ) , which can cause chemical addiction in virtually everyone who uses them .
alcohol also has a safe dosage , so use does not automatically imply misuse or any negative consequences at all .
hard drugs do not have dosage levels where they have limited physiological effects ( that , of course , would defeat the purpose for taking them ) .
it helps to point out the logical flaw and rediculousness of the claim to push it to it 's logical extent .
you are the one who is broadening the definitions and criteria to the point of uselessness in order to include alcohol in the same category as hard drugs .
by broadening it further , chemisttree emphasizes the logical flaw and forces you to ( traps you into ) address[ing ] it .
ie , now that you acknowledge that broadening the criteria too far results in rediculousness , you should make an attempt to justify why your broadening of the criteria does n't also result in rediculousness .
wow only __value1__ % of the population is genetically predispositioned to becoming an alcoholic , i just checked the population of the __name1__ and as of __month1__ 08 it was __quant1__ and __value2__ % of that is a bit over __quant2__ , quite an insignificant number indeed .
one does not have to be an alcoholic to abuse alcohol unfortunately .
in __name1__ , __name2__ they have arrested over __quant1__ for dui since the __day1__ of the year .
that is about 3 __quant1__ day .
i am sure that many of them were not alcoholics but that makes little difference .
i spent __quant1__ years in management and safety in the trucking industry and i cleaned up over __quant2__ truck wrecks , __quant3__ of them were fatals with a total of __quant4__ fatalities .
every one of those __quant1__ fatals involved alcohol .
in __quant1__ instance our driver was drunk in __quant2__ it was drunk drivers hittng our trucks and in __quant3__ instances it was people under the influence using our trucks as a means of suicide .
one by throwing himself under the wheels as the truck pulled away from a cafe and another where a young lady , under the influence , had a fight with her boyfriend , demanded that he stop and let her out .
when he did , she ran out into the freeway and stood in front of our truck .
our driver tried to stop and tried to evade her but she moved back in front of the truck .
i doubt seriously that you can get the same results with coffee or chocolate .
just a thought but if alcohol is not addictive , why did so many people risk fines and jail to drink it during prohibition when they could have just drank coffee or ate a __name1__ .
in my previous post i said the guy who hit and killed __quant1__ people got __quant2__ years , i was wrong he only got __quant3__ .
i remember from working for the __name1__ that alcohol is a hard drugs ...
when you are adicted to it .
however , recreational use is possible .
i love to watch football with some friends and some beers .
i wondered if i could enjoy the game if me and my friends would shoot up some heroin first .
the problem with hard drugs is that recreational usage is not really possible .
a serious alcohol adiction is right up there with other hard drugs .
__name1__ is proposing a law that will ban handguns for its residents excluding , of course , the police , military , security and other jobs that require one to own a handgun .
i can find no reason for anyone to have a handgun at home or even carry one around .
i know this is a hot topic , but thought it would be interesting to see what others ' opinions are on the subject .
for the general public : · do you think people should own guns ?
do you think people need to own guns ?
do you think current gun control laws ( federal ) are a true form of control ?
-- okay obviously i have a bias based on how the question is posed .
banning hand guns just gives criminals more advantage than they already have .
i own several guns .
i can tell you that since i have owned a handgun i have realized how easy it is to carry one concealed .
if criminals knew that most people would cease to carry because it is illegal then does n't that give them advantages ?
the way it is now you never know who is carrying .
does n't this give the general public an advantage because it is less likely a criminal will try to pull something knowing that he could get a shell in the back of his head because someone could have a gun ?
do you really think gun laws will keep criminals from getting guns ?
there are alot more uses for guns than shooting people .
if shooting people is the only reason you can think of then you are the cold blooded one , not the honest people who choose to own guns and use them responsibly and in some cases actually wear them out .
you act as if every gun ever sold has an owner who is just waiting to use it in a murder .
i will also tell you that if guns are banned information will pop up everywhere on how to make your own gun .
it 's really not that hard to make one with some basic metalworking equipment .
guns are too much part of society in the __name1__ to change the way people feel about them .
to be fair , i should have added a __value1__ poll choice -- current gun laws need to be revised -- as it is the poll does not consider many aspects of the current gun laws that i find disturbing .
for instance , the law requires one to registered and be licensed to own a gun , yet there are no provisions requiring gun owners to update their license when they move or sell their gun .
this is a huge loop hole within gun control in my opinion .
another problem is that the turn @-@ around for background checks is only 24 hours -- is that really sufficient time ?
with such a powerful item , i think more time should be required .
plus state to state laws differ greatly and i find all sorts of possible dangers that allow criminals to acquire guns too easily .
i do n't want to " send " my kids to school anyway , but that 's irrelevant .
yeah , i would prefer to have my kids in a school where somebody could do something if the school was being taken over .
in some places students can bring guns to school ( rifle clubs ) .
certainly , but only if you use it incorrectly .
certainly , but again , only if you use these things in ways that were not intended .
the spread pattern makes it easier to hit what you are aiming at .
the same goes for the fact that its large and has a stock - i do n't know if you 're a shooter , but for an unskilled shooter , a handgun is extremely difficult to aim .
shotguns also have " stopping power ."
i 'm not suggesting everyone will be able to go buy a handgun and shoot burglars in the head with __value1__ % accuracy , but that 's what shooting ranges are for .
if you can n't aim a pistol , stay away from them .
i 've shot them before and did n't find them particularly difficult .
whoa now - " more sophisticated than their military "?
you 're suggesting civilians should be allowed to own machine guns , tanks , and rocket launchers ?
if you check __name1__ 's murder rate , you 'll find it does not support your assertion .
said in __year1__ or thereabouts , when the most powerful @/@ sophisticated weapons that existed were a muzzle @-@ loaded bal @-@ shot musket and a cannon .
clearly , this provision of the 2 nd __name1__ ( and the general principle being discussed here of defense against your government ) is long obsolete .
sure .
a few tanks and assualt weapons in the right civilian hands in __name1__ could change the country into something better almost immediately .
or do you want the defenseless starving civilians to keep dying ?
nevertheless , apart from its __name2__ @-@ supplied nuclear and missile technologies , __name1__ is one of the weakest nations in the world .
it is economically moribund , devastated by the collectivist scourge .
experts estimate that from one to two million people have died of starvation since __year1__ , out of a population of twenty @-@ two million .
flocks of orphaned children search amid the refuse for scraps of food .
in __quant2__ decade , life expectancy declined by __quant1__ years .
and this while the country was receiving generous aid : by __month1__ of __year1__ , __name1__ had delivered __quant1__ metric tons of food and the __name2__ had spent __quant2__ euros on relief .
but again we see what little likelihood there is of aid actualy getting to populations in need .
there is every reason to think that these donations have served instead to boost the regime 's military arsenal : in __year1__ , at the height of the famine , __name1__ purchased __quant1__ submarines from __name2__ .
the military is so ridiculously powerful compared to the ordinary citizen that nothing is going to happen until weapons of war are captured for a revolt , or a country declares war on __name1__ .
i gave it as an example which is what the poster asked .
i 'm not the one who picked it apart .
your smart a $$ attitude is not helping your cause .
so give me a better example then ...
or even harder ...
try to give me a good example not based on " fear ".
yes .
think you got what i ment anyway .
ok , i would be a lot more frightened by the thought of that guns ending up in some kids hands ...
oh , this is cute .
they just had to overturn an election in __name1__ ( the __name2__ county where the sheriff just got busted for his involvement in the drug business ) because they got __value1__ % turnout .
see what happens when you have a __name1__ president ?
-@ joe
the simplest record method is that you get a printed receipt that you can verify matches your intended vote , but without your name on it .
then you drop that receipt into a box before leaving the polling place .
this would be just like the manual voting cards we used prior to the machines .
if there is any funky number business , then the receipts can be counted by hand .
that 's a manual recount .
if you really want to have fun , print the receipts as __name1__ forms .
then there is a recountable record that does not have the voter 's id associated , but the voter checks before submitting , that is independent of the electronic record in the machines and any code finagling and whatnot .
i like this idea .
that sounds really good
i do n't think we can rely on voting machines when they have no way to verify the count .
the head of __name1__ said his mission was to see that __name2__ was re @-@ elected .
he did not say he wanted to have a great working machine .
what does it take for us to shit can them ?
__name1__ no longer makes voting machines .
that part of its business was spun off into a separate company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/premier_election_solutions"> premier election solutions </a> __year1__ 2007 , and that in turn was bought another company called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/election_systems_%26_software"> election systems & software __year2__ in 2009 .
so you do n't have to be scared of the __name1__ boogeyman anymore .
the bigger part of __name1__ 's business , by far , is atm machines .
__value1__ href="http://www.votersunite.org/info/es&sinthenews.pdf"> http://www.votersunite.org/info/es&sinthenews.pdf __name1__ & s are just so different .
half owner was a __name1__ vp . nope , no relationship at all .

they do n't test the machines .
fine , just do n't talk about __name1__ voting machines anymore .
talk about __name1__ s.
__value1__ href="http://www.bradblog.com/?p=7906"> http://www.bradblog.com/?p=7906 </a> totally inadequate response .
the voter machine companies are p[laying __name1__ and who knows who actually owns what ?
but our machines are now mostly in hands of __name1__ and __name2__ companies .
can that be justified ?
we are talking about election credibility .
the machines should not be in private hands .
definitely a back to the future picture show .
ah , all those desirable wonders of the __century1__ century , __era1__ , anyway .
no polio vaccines , no antibiotics , no automobiles , no radio , no television , just a man and his goats communing together .

it was taken during the attack in __name2__ against the __name1__ lankan __name1__ in __month1__ __year1__ , now see the pictures below , taken during the __name3__ attacks __month2__ __year2__ , the same __quant1__ terrorists were photographed at both events !
a saffron red thread called a tilak , worn around the wrist is considered to have deep religious significance among __name1__ , that 's the red bit around his right wrist .

1 . they let him off , huh ?
expect to see more of this , then .

__name2__ – tall and tan and young and lovely , the girl from __name1__ goes … “ ew , what ’s that smell ? ”

my wife had a minor scrape in a car park and the net result was a couple of scratches on both cars .
she was at fault and asked the other driver to contact us so we make the situation good .
our garage reckoned our damage would cost £50 and his was less extensive !
we heard nothing and then got a letter from the insurance company saying he had submitted a claim .
my wife texted him and he said " tough - i 'm getting a nice new bumper and the loss of your ncd will pay for it ".
or slightly blunter words to that effect .
assuming he is correct do we have any rights to challenge the insurance company 's assessment who seem to have inflated the claim at the expense of our ncd !
malc
not really .
it 's up to your insurers to decide how they want to settle a claim .
hello ,
just looking for some more advice on my situation .
__quant1__ was recently made redundant __quant1__ week after announcing my pregnancy .
after receiving legal advice i have been advised to send a letter to my employer highlighting that i wish to appeal their decision .
does anyone have any idea where i can find a template letter to follow and also whether the fact i was a temporary employer matters when it comes to appealing a decision .
many thanks
do n't order anything online if __name1__ are delivering it - here 's my experience .
ordered a __quant1__ " tv online , cheaper than __name1__ - who did n't have it in stock - but with the delivery charge the cost was the same .
advised that it would be delivered by __name1__ on tuesday .
tuesday came and went , no sign .
phoned amtrak on wednesday , " we need a consignment number ".
phoned online company and got it .
phoned __name1__ " a card was left on tuesday as you were n't there " ( no it was n't of course ) , and " we 're not allowed to leave it with a neighbour ".
arranged for another delivery on saturday .
arrived home yesterday - it had been delivered next door yesterday , with a card saying this was their __value1__ attempt at delivery ...
what a bunch of jokers .
my friend was scammed this __name1__ and i wouldnt want anyone else to fall prey to these bar*****s
he answered __quant1__ of those russian wife emails which are going around at the moment .
when she replied she seemed nice and the photo given was a gorgous young lady .
ater a few exchanges of emails my friend decided he wanted to meet however there was a catch .
she had no money for the flight .
it would cost £450 + £50 transfer by __name1__ .
anyway blinded by love or lust he sent the money .
unfortunately that was not the last he heard from her because she said she will come over __name1__ .
my friend embarked on a shopping spree .
pressies and doing up the bedroom to make it their love nest .
he then got an email saying she needed to prove to immigration that she could support herself .
she needed $ __quant1__ or £900 .
he was dubious but checked with a someone __name1__ european he was acquainted with , who convinced him it was possible .
anyway he promptly wired the money over to her .
the day before she was supposed to arrive she got an email .
it said she was on the train after visiting the bank when she was mugged .
she needed more money .
by this time my friend was desperate to meet her .
without a thought he paid her .
i think you can guess what happened .
did she show up for __name1__ ? ?
my friend is one of the nicest guys you can meet .
he has been unlucky in love and has __quant1__ small children .
although sex was probably at the front of his mind i think he genuinely was looking for a companion .
he has learnt a valuable less extremely expensively
too late now , but another variant on advance fee fraud ( google for this and @/@ or 419 scam ) .
most of them hit one or more of the __quant1__ deadly sins , and there are that many photo 's and documents available on t'web these days .
he 's far from being the only one by the way - these scams rake in several __quant1__ each year .
this is the classic foreighn bride scam - your friend was probably not even communicating with a women at all .
__name1__ is never to send money topeople you do n't know and have never met .
remember , mishka on __name1__ turned up and was a very amazing __name2__ bride .
i 'm sure there are good offers out there .
im sorry but i have no sympathy at all for him .
surely he has read and heard these stories before .
how many times did he send money ? ??
id have understood a tad if only once but 3 times , come on , get a grip .
these scams happen because people are stupid enough to belive them .
dont tell me when you first read the post you first thought wasnt " he hasnt really fallen for that "
tut tut tut , maybe next time he will learn when he gets an email saying he 's won the spanish lottery , all he needs to do is send __quant1__ to release the money ! !!!
lol
there is no way a __name1__ women can get a visa to visit the __name2__ on her own simply as a tourist - she would need a uk sponsor , and the visa would be a fiancee visa , not a tourist visa .
someone posted a story very similar to this on the moneysaving marriages forum over __name1__ .
it involved her dad .
similar thing , she was mugged etc and he had to send more money , but this one did turn up over here .
ill see if i can find the thread .

you need to check that .
it actually depends on the status of the lady in her own country , but yes she would still need a sponsor .
my sons girlfriend is __name1__ , she qualifies in her own right for a tourist visa and does n't need a fianc !

fianc !
visa means you have to marry in __quant1__ or __quant2__ days a tourist visa gives you __quant3__ - __quant4__ months in the __name1__ this scam used to be the the __name2__ lady __name3__ passport scam .
the bit where this is hard to believe is where you say he " checked with someone __name1__ european he was aquainted with ".er..
did he not run this by anyone else..
cos wouldnt __value1__ % have said nooooo..
is anyone else always suspicious of posts which involve much foolishness supposedly happening to ' a friend '.
do n't get me wrong - i do feel sorry for the person it happened to - if only for the obvious loneliness which drove a man to the point where all reason flies out of the window but was n't it a wise woman ( or man ) who said that __name1__ gave man a brain and a p***s but not enough blood to run both of them at the same time ! !!!

ha ha ha .
dont know about cliff , thought he was indestructible ?
not like __name1__ who croaked yesterday .
rip __name1__ .
haha , i dont wish cliff any ill health tbh he comes across as quit a nice bloke , but i wish he would call it a day with the singing and take up train spotting or something .
ooh you had me all worried there !
cliff 's got many more years in him yet !
you had me for __quant1__ second
well these celebrities seem to die in threes ...
who are the next two ?
that is the way to get peoples attention
ive met him and hes very nice in person he asked my sister to go to a party and had a slightly rusty __name1__
there was an accident in town with a catbacker bus ( __name1__ fans ) that went under a bridge that connected dorms .......
some people were on the very top of the bus ( which they shouldnt be , while the vehicle is moving ) , anyways , one person had what the paper called " a head injury " which was decapitation
and the other was in critical condition ......
thats a real downer ......
especially after your team loses , then you lose your head
that is really unfortunate .
decapitation can ruin your whole day .
i 've never had a fatal accident but they do n't sound good
if you ever have one be sure to post about it here !
i know a guy , who knows a guy who got decapitated once ....
he has n't been right since ...
some folks just lose their heads over decapitation .
my grandfather 's __value1__ wife was decapitated .
he was cleared of all charges .
i had a friend that __quant1__ worked with many years ago .
he was decapatated after his mini truck went under a diesel .
poor guy .
they said he didnt feel any pain .
and needless to say , there was no open casket .
my boyfriend does graphics for barry cooper ( the ex @-@ __name1__ cop who now makes documentaries based around marijuana @-@ never get busted and never get raided ) and we met him for the first time at the premiere public screening of never get raided this past saturday in __name2__ .
ever since then , i 've been drooling like a rabid squirrel .
i 've suddenly become infatuated with this guy .
but i feel so good ...
like a kid again with a silly crush and fantasy .
of course , nothing will ever come from these crazy feelings , he 's __quant1__ years my senior and married to his soulmate and i 'm in love with my boyfriend .
it 's just wild , but maybe i 'm just star @-@ struck .
he 's the closest thing to a celebrity that i 've ever known .
he 's been on __name1__ @/@ __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ ...
not necessarily famous , but getting there .
but good god the things i would do to that man if all of the situations i just listed off were n't so .
haha .
so good thing you were not left alone in the limo , lol i could see the headlines now .
i choose the right girls , but can n't commit 2 them , and choose the wrong guys , for example , my __value1__ true love cheated on me several times , my next realtionship i got engaged and he hit me , and the __value2__ rd guy , well thts unspeakable of what he did to me at night time ...
but yeah thats my true confessions , i cant stay single and attract the wrong guys .

i have a favour to ask on behalf of <a href="http://hipforums.com/forums/member.php?u=4986"> smartie.uk </a> who 's currently __name1__ angouleme on the first part of his travels __name2__ europe .
he 's staying in a hostel and will be heading southwards on tuesday ( __month1__ __day1__ ) , heading roughly in the direction of __name1__ across the __name2__ .
he just texted me to ask if any of you __name1__ hipforumers are in the area and would be kind enough to give him a lift southwards ?
if anyone is willing to help out a fellow hipforumer please get in touch !
thankyou kindly !
i am nomadic by nature .
i can n't stay in __quant2__ place for more than a couple months .
i just can n't .
ever since i was old enough to figure out how to use public transportation by myself , i 've been taking off on whim to wherever .
and i have had legal troubles for the past __quant1__ years .
before , i was under __quant1__ , so the cops kept bringing me back to my parents .
and then i got arrested when i was __quant1__ , and every time i stay put somewhere for too long , i get arrested again .
my only crime ever has been possession .
and i have __quant1__ felonies and too many misdemeanors to count .
i am bad at being a " criminal " i guess .
anarchist pheramones is all that i can think of to account for how i get caught so much .
all i do is possess drugs !
i do n't steal or bother anybody .
anyway , i recently got out of prison .
( the worst part about going to prison was that they made me comb out my dreads to make sure i was n't smuggling something in in them .
ha ! ) so anyway , __quant1__ 'm on parole for __quant1__ year .
and __quant1__ have to be in __name1__ for __quant1__ year to complete parole .
and i already bought a __name2__ ticket to __name1__ .
but i 'm trying to make myself stay here to complete parole .
because parole is easy .
all __quant1__ have to do is call them from a land line every week .
and if i 'm in another state , and a cop runs my name , it will show up that i 'm on parole , so i 'll violate and get sent back to prison .
i 've already been extradited twice .
it sucks .
so i wanna make myself stay here all year .
it seems impossible .
how do people do it ?
even if i had a place in my name , it would be easy for me to just leave it to go somewhere for a while .
because the same places get boring , and i need to travel .
it 's in my blood .
but if i complete parole , i might finally be free to travel without being a fugitive , and then i can just become transient indefinitly , and that 's my dream .
advice ?
hi , this is what you get for speeding .
a spanking .
police sued over alleged paddling of teen for speeding ticket .
i think the police went overboard with the spanking of this __quant1__ year old .
what do you think of this ?
<a href="http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/a/2004/03/31/national1238est0613.dtl"> http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cg...238est0613.dtl </a>
thanks , robert .
i would like to see a little background on the cop and the boy .
the story seems strangly one sided .
it seems like the whole thing is fdrom mommy 's pov .
i think she may have just seen a cool opportunity to make a quick 200 grand .
on the other hand ...
what kind of police dept does this place have ?
i would have felt a little strange dishing out that punishment .
sounds like we have a cop who likes to spank teenaged boys .
muzikdude , i 'm with you on feeling wierd about the cop .
i suspect the cop is enjoying the spanking .
yeah somethings fishy because fines for speeding tickets are a source of revenue for the town .
why 'd they give that away and tie up a cops hours in __quant1__ shot is stupid
yeah , anybody else catch the pants @-@ down aspect ?
this was a sexual assault .
that is crazy..
ewww ...
i 'm against corporal punishment in general , but this was rather disturbing .
first off a __quant1__ year old is more adult than child .
second , there is nothing sexual about paddling a bare bottom unless your into that sort of thing .
it was a stupid idea , from a small town cop .
can n't say i 'm amazed , disturbed or even surprised .
heck yeah !
i think it is hilarious and they should take up the policy .
most kids my age are brash and arrogant and could probably use a paddling .
yeah , at __value1__ glance i found the idea to be quite funny .
then i read the article and the mother saying her son , no wait child , was " tramatized ".
yeah , then they called the __quant1__ guy a " child ".
hmm , lets see : consider myself a man , __quant1__ year age difference , *thinks*....
aha !
i have it !
the guy really is a child becuase he was " tramatized " over a paddling .
what i find interesting is that the __quant1__ year old allowed the cop to paddle him , not __quant3__ , but __quant2__ times .
i 'm sorry , but this is both funny and sick at the same time .
the mother probably agreed so that whatever the child had done would ' go away ' and their insurance would n't get higher .
the guy , or ' child ', probably did n't want to pay the ticket and figured that the ' paddling ' would be like the ones his mom @/@ dad probably gave him as a younger child .
lets face it , parents do n't enjoy spanking their kids , as it causes them pain .
i know for a fact that my mom and dad did n't give me a ' thrashing ' as a kid , but i sure did n't want to curse again after getting spanked for saying the word for a person with no father .
the police is honestly probably a very sick person .
not once have i ever heard of a cop giving the people a ' choice ' in their ticketing .
he probably saw this as a way to get some of his rocks off , and took the risk .
now he 's gotten introuble for it , and i hope that if his intentions were what i think they were , he gets fired .
there is no need for spanking a __quant1__ year old , let alone even thinking of trying to do so bare bottom .
~shakes his head~
if i was this kid , i would never have agreed to it .
think of the humiliation this boy is going to have have to face in school .
~sigh~.
people always make things harder for themselves .
just pay the ticket and get over it .
*chuckles* auto filter at my board changes that to ' person of illegitimate parentage '.
i do n't know if the police wanted to do this to ' get his rocks off ', but i do know that it was inapropriete .
however , i think just about everyone went into fault here : the teenager twice ( for speeding and for agreeing to an alternative punnishment he must have known was illegal ) , the mother for agreeing to something like this and then sueing over it , and the chief of police for making up such a sick ' program ' in the __value1__ place .
should the mother sue to get the police chief removed : yes , of course that man should be removed .
should she get even __quant1__ dollar ?
no ! !
she decided to agree when she heard of a program for her __quant1__ year old son that included __quant2__ paddling sessions ?
and then there were no alarmbells going off ?
but when he came out crying , there were ?
i 'm sorry ...
but no.
perhaps a social worker should be assigned to them to see what parenting values there are in that family , and to give them some good advice .

well i am now married ...
i got married last week on friday , __month1__ __day1__ th..
i 'm grateful for this because now i have medical insurance , i had started a new job , waited my __quant1__ month period , was super excited about insurance , since i was getting a better insurance than my previous employer , then the insurance company said i had no insurance because i never sent a form in ...
was unreal , i could n't believe what i was hearing..
__quant2__ even asked the man nicely " how can someone with __name1__ not file for insurance when my medication alone cost about $ __quant1__ __quant2__ year ."
he did n't comment..
so from there we changed our spring wedding to __month1__ , a really small wedding to get insurance for me faster .
alot of people must have been praying for me since my __name1__ has n't been too bad except for when i was ill in august/september .
i 'm really happy to have insurance , i can get my mris done , since i am in __name3__ now i can go to __name1__ which has some of the best neurologists ( my neurologist from __name2__ told me this ) , get started on medication again..
today i 'm feeling ok..
my job is bothering me a bit , but i 'll get over it..
next week __quant4__ start working __quant1__ days __quant4__ week , about __quant3__ hours..
i work for __name1__ and they told me __name2__ is the craziest time of the year
this is my __value1__ __name1__ working for the company so hopefully all will go well ...
i know as soon as i get home starting next week i 'll most likely just fall
it 's going to be hard because i won't see my husband much ....
i now have to work on sundays for the next __quant1__ weeks so i wont be able to go to church or see him ...
my only day off will be monday , and his wednesday .
just have to keep alot of prayer
, and keep rejoicing
well it 's saturday ! !!
here at work until 7 ....
snow is everywhere , snowed yeserday until this morning , got a good __quant1__ inches ! !!
i can n't believe it..
it 's almost __year1__ already , where has time gone ...
i 'm looking foward to warm weather already and i have to wait about __quant1__ months to see it ! !
lol..
__name1__ protected me this morning ...
i was driving to work , and hit the brakes too much instead of downshifting and lowering my rpms , and spun out , __quant1__ did n't hit anyone thankfully just went into a driveway ...
phew
what a blessing that was since it 's a busy road .
hallelujah , hallelujah… may everything about me be… hallelujah to my king….
- lyrics from __name1__ .
well it 's another sunday and i 'm here at work again !
only __quant1__ more sundays and i 'm back to having my sunday @-@ monday days off again .
it 's been a crazy week so far , my husband and i are thinking about leaving the crazy weather of __name1__ to move to florida..
i know , __name1__ ! !!!
i have never even been to __name1__ , lol .
it 's looking pretty positive right now , but he insists that he wants to buy a house , and i want an apartment..
he 's also going to allow me to work part time , and i can go back to college .
__name1__ bless him .
we told some friends last night , but i only told my auntie about this , no one in our family knows at all .
i 'm very nervous @/@ scared to live in __name1__ , seeing that i lived in __name2__ all my life until __month1__ of this year when i moved to __name3__ .
his mom is probably not going to take it too well if we decide to go to __name1__ , she 's already pretty upset that his other __quant2__ brother already been living in __name2__ with their wives for sometime now , and she thought her youngest was going to stay closeby in __name3__ .
__name1__ will be different if we go ...
it 's looking pretty positive of going .
we just got to finish paying off his debt , and go from there ...
i pray that the __name1__ will guide us in the right direction .
if we were to go to __name1__ i pray the __name2__ directs us to a good church .
the " punishment " of __name1__ for viciously beating , raping and burning his innocent 5 year old daughter who this sick and twisted man suspected of not being a virgin ...
a __quant1__ dollar fine and time served ...
is an offense to __name1__ and every decent human being alike .
it is also an extreme hypocrisy that in __name3__ , a man cannot be executed for killing his children or wife , but can face the death penalty for leaving __name1__ and becoming a __name2__ ( or a member of any other religion ) .
the __name1__ came out with a statement decrying both the murder and the " punishment " ( if it can be called that ) .
while i do not agree with them that the __name2__ is __name1__ 's word or that __name3__ is his prophet , everything else they said regarding the case is dead @-@ on , in my opinion .
i agree with them that capital punishment is wrong , albeit not only for the reasons they gave ( which i think are good ones ) but also because __name1__ clearly said in the __name2__ that those who do not show mercy will not be shown mercy by god .
the __name2__ rapist __name1__ @-@ __name1__ , got away with murder
the intention of __name1__ law was to serve justice to the parties in conflict , it is human interpretation of __name2__ 's word to suit their era , it is not a divine law , neither is it god 's law as propagated .
however , it is the abuse in administering the __name1__ law that is the problem .
unfortunately , the __name1__ law is so distorted that it sounds like a cruel system of law to a woman who gets thrown out on the whim of an idiot by calling __value1__ three times , female rape victim , an apostate and the blasphemer .
those men you have listed , " __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , __name5__ or __name6__ , " were great men with a few exceptions for their time .
they defined the __name1__ in terms of the norms prevalent at that time .
with all due respect and honor for their work , they did not have the same environment as prophet muhammad did or we have , - of working with different tribes and faiths , and as a result their attitudes were " stick it to them ".
this man , __name1__ @-@ __name1__ got away paying the blood money .
he should have been locked away , as they say in __name1__ " qaid ba @-@ __value1__ " prison with hard labor .
what prevents the sob from repeating it ?
if he has the money to shell out again , he will do it again .
i n the __name1__ there are many incidents where a hard core criminal was let out on bail , and he would do go out and do the same .
i am personally against the state killing the criminal deliberately , it denies the criminal from living the life , and prevents him from repenting his mistake ....
and the blood money does not bring justice , compensation should be there to the victims , but that should be a part of whole punishment .
we cannot trade life for money .
only __name1__ 's word is beyond question , __name2__ 's words , if genuine , would be unquestionable .
a lot has been dished out as __name1__ 's word .
i come across so much non @-@ sense ascribed to him .
he was the ultimate peace maker and rightfully called rahmatul aalameen -@ the mercy to mankind .
__name1__ do not uphold that title for him ; they are brutal towards those who convert from islam to other faiths , or blasphemers .
some __name1__ are very insecure in their faith , they think that __name2__ will disappear into thin air if someone criticizes him , or not defended .
__name1__ ( pbuh ) is beyond defending .
some of the imams did not have faith in the __name1__ and resorted to defending him , how wrong are they !
be hopeful , things will change for better , the new generation will restore common sense to the religion which is about fairness , justness and respect for __name1__ 's creation .
__name1__ is about freedom and not compulsion .

i know i may be stepping into a minefield here but i have to ask this .
__quant1__ was listening to __name1__ on the way to work today and __quant1__ of their reporters was at a celebration that __name2__ held after winning in __name3__ .
the reporter was clearly next to a female who was praying in a loud , almost ranting type of way , asking god to lift up __name1__ , etc etc and asking __name2__ to make sure that huckabee is proud of being a pastor and how we are to select leaders who are spiritual , etc. i would have given anything to see a videotape of it
the press can do a remarkable job of taking even the most innocuous instance and sometimes just by broadcasting it , make it look really bad .
this was one of those cases .
i asked some fellow __name2__ about a thesis that was forming in my mind about the possibility of __name1__ being elected .
i specifically asked if we , as __name1__ , have become so pious that we believe that the only person who can lead this country is an ordained __name2__ minister .
__quant1__ mean , think about that for __quant1__ second .
the field is wide open , yet why is it that the __name1__ pile on __name2__ 's wagon and openly snub other people , like __name3__ ?
it would be wrong of us to issue a call to __name1__ to be the pastor of first baptist church .
clearly he does not share our doctrine .
but does that mean that we should n't support him ?
or what about __name1__ ?
he has been married and divorced several times .
but i would remind folks that the divorce rate is the same for those of us who are " churched " and those who are unchurched .
yet it seems like we judge him on his divorces .
does anybody really believe that if __name1__ gets elected that his wife is going to divorce the powerful person in the country while he is in office ?
not a chance .
__name1__ 's marriage is not going to end in divorce ( hopefully ever ) but especially not if he gets elected .
bottom line ?
there is no way that a if a __name1__ gets elected that they will go act in a manner contrary to conservative opinions on abortion , gay marriage , etc. and by the way , there are bigger issues than those .
to do so would be the death knell of the __name1__ .
i 'm not saying that i endorse any of these candidates .
but i do believe that we should n't jump on __name1__ 's wagon just because he is a pastor .
so if what i said is true about what a __name2__ president will not do , then why the support for __name1__ ?
are some of us naive ?
am i the only one who feels that he is using __name1__ as a prop in the election ( think of his __name2__ day ad if you disagree ) .
i would sooner walk across hot coals than attend a __name1__ rally and rant and cheer when he speaks of values .
same thing goes for most rallies by most of today 's presidential candidates .
they are using us as props and we need to be resistant of that .
to put it another way , if you had attended a rally for __name1__ back in __year1__ , would you dare tell anyone now that you were there back then ?
probably not .
and for the young lady who was probably miked for her prayer , i would respectfully ask that she keep it down .
showboating like that , i believe , only pushes us backward in our ability to spread the __name1__ and bring more people to __name2__ .
wait , what exactly is your question ?
are people naive ?
oohhhhhh yeah .
but maybe that is n't your question .
my question is why are people jumping on __name1__ 's bandwagon .
the rest of it was food for thought .
maybe they found someone they can identify with that is in the race that is n't a slick __name2__ __name1__ @-@ poser politician or a beltway insider or a fringe nutjob ...
maybe you are right .
my concern is the inordinate level of support he is drawing from __name1__ evangelicals .
he does not have the broad support that __name1__ has .
with __name1__ , it is very concentrated .
it 's an election , people vote for they believe is the right guy ( or gal ) ...
he reflects __name1__ beliefs , by and large the others are snakey , so who do ya think they 're gonna vote for ?
more politicians than not are like that .
but they are going for him without so much as a glance at his record .
look at all the people he paroled while in __name1__ .
i heard it was half the state .
okay , i 'm kidding .
the guy does n't have that great of a record .
just because he shares our beliefs does n't entitle him to the presidency .
separation of church and state exists for a reason and do n't think for __quant1__ second that if he gets in that the lines won't become dangerously blurred .
and although i havn't finished it , i can say it is a decent book .
fast paced .
great plot .
but anyone who buys the theories and " history " of this book needs to do some reading that does n't come from the section in a grocery store line next to the __name1__ .
you are a crack up !
i have n't read it yet - we keep meaning to .
kinda seems important to have a bit of a feel of things hey .
i liked it too , the writing was n't great but it was a good read .
i agree about the theories and history too !
it 's straight out of " __name1__ blood , __name1__ ", did anyone ever read that book ?
i havn't .
but i heard the authors sued him over it in __name1__ .
i 'm reading it now .
i 'm a fan of alternative histories , and this is among the oldest ones in the __name1__ tradition .
to be quite truthful its been around far longer than " __name1__ blood , __name1__ ."
in fact merovich claimed to be descended from __name1__ according to more than one account .
the history of it is utter hogwash ( the canon was n't even voted on at __name1__ ) .
however it is a good plot and a fastpaced read .
__quant1__ 'm severely dyslexic and made it through it in under __quant1__ week .
joe zollars
i enjoyed it ' t'was very readable , and a good work of fiction .
i just wish more people would realise that that 's what it is .
if we do n't know the history of our faith , we are liable to believe anything someone tells about it as history .
fortunately , most of us probably know enough about our faith not to fall here .
unfortunately not every __name1__ does ....
that is what is concerning .
i 've got a copy around somewhere , but have n't got around to reading it .
it 's more the atheists i 'm worried about ...
atheiests think we are all suckers , so if we look overly paranoid about some popular book or movie - it will confirm their suspicions .
indeed so gtsecc .
i would add that it is important that we do read the book , and if we can n't do that at least watch the movie ( it really is a much better book ) .
how can we answer sincere question about the faith when we do n't even know the questions ?
joe zollars
after you finish it , i suggest you get " __name1__ " next .
you will probably find , like many of us that have read both books , that a&d is actually the better of the two .
part of the reason i am reading it .
you hit the nail on the head .
i just might , i am thoroughly enjoying __name1__ .
what about his book about the digital hacking ?
i think it was written before a&d .
indeed so !
joe zollars
umm well nto so good imo .
__name1__ is most likely a __quant1__ hit wonder .
joe zollars
i just finished it last night after i posted .
i just have __quant1__ thing to say .
wow , i did n't see that coming .....
really ?
okay , i 'll steer clear of that one , but i 'll look at a&d .
cola , now you see why it is sucha good book .
i guessed it like __quant1__ chapters before they told you--but still , that 's aways into the book .
he does at least know how to do suspense fiction .
joe zollars
that he does sir , that he does .
while we are on the topic of suspense novels , what else do you guys like ?
while not necessarily the same type of suspense , jurrassic __name1__ was awesome .
the movie pales in comparison .
most movies are weak compared to the book , but this moreso .
that brings up another topic , was __name1__ movie any good ?
i have n't seen it .
actually , i liked " __name1__ ".
i found it difficult to put down .
i also liked " __name1__ ".
so i have read all __quant1__ of his books and enjoyed them .
having read all __quant1__ , i will admit that the only drawback to __name1__ 's style is that his books seem to have been written on a template .
they all follow the same format .
you 'll understand what i mean after you read 2 or 3 of them .
what makes a council ecumenical in the eyes of the __name1__ ?
bishops all over the world meet together to deal with faith and pastoral problems .
councils that are admitted by our church are : 1 @- __name1__ : ( __year1__ a.d.) that dealt with __name2__ who denied __name3__ 's divinity .
2 @- council of constantinople : ( __year1__ a.d.) because of machdonius who denied the divinity of the __name1__ .
3 @- council of ephesus : ( __year1__ a.d.) because of __name1__ who separated between __name2__ 's divinity and humanity .
__name1__ had an effective role in these councils .
also the council judgments must not conflict with the first church fathers teachings as " __name1__ & __name2__ "
__quant1__ things :
1 . it conveys the right faith .
2 . justly accepted by the __name1__ , all who are of the same faith .
( that 's what seperates an " ecumenical " council from a " local " council that conveyes true faith ) .
we as oo 's used to think we were the __name1__ , but today , the __value1__ and __value2__ councils held at __name2__ ( __year1__ and __year2__ ) are not considered ecumenical , since the eo counterparts also held __name3__ faith in their last __value3__ councils ( or __value4__ ) .
technically , we did have __quant1__ " ecumenical councils , " but in light of the present discussions , we agree to __quant2__ : __name1__ , __name2__ , and __name3__ __year1__ .
__name1__ bless .
mina
__quant1__ things :
we mean by __name1__ the universal church not the __name2__ __name1__
__quant1__ things :
i thought the point of an ecumenical council was to clarify essentialy there is a despute over the right faith and the council " decides " what is .
how can this be a condition .
indeed , councils come about because of disputes .
i never heard of a council convened for the sake of convening .
but you asked how do councils become " ecumenical ."
__name1__ bless .
mina
well yes but my point is that if the right faith is in dispute before the council and in order for the council to be ecumenical it must convey the right faith then there is no point in having an ecumenical council because after the council __quant1__ side will say that it did have the right faith and the other will say that it did n't and you will be right back where you began .
oh and i have heard of local councils convening for the sake of convening .
and that 's why different denominations have different opinions on the numbers of ecumenical councils , and what they are .
unless , you do not believe that you are the only church , of which outside her there is no clear path of salvation .
in this case , any council after an " unnecessary " schism is not " accepted by the __name1__ " ( in an ecumenical sense ) , and thus not " ecumenical ."
for example , in light of today 's eo @-@ oo discussions , any counci after · __name1__ __year1__ is not " ecumenical , " but are considered no more than local councils that profess __name2__ faith .
what did you have in mind in the " qualifications " of an ecumenical council ?
they 're very rare in ancient times .
__name1__ bless .
mina
sorry this took so long .
so what is an " unnecessary " schism ?
i 'd say all schism regarding a division in truth is necessary .
well i mean that when a __name1__ says ecumenical council they mean a council that was held in order to confront a dispute and then once it is over everyone should just except that as truth .
( although obviously they do n't )
however in the __name1__ we say it is ecumenical when the pope says it 's ecumenical .
so i wondered what makes it ecumenical to an __name1__ person .
i had an idea but it did n't really make any sense to me .
so i thought i 'd come here and ask .
but it seems we have a different idea of an ecumenical council so i guess what to an oo person is an ecumenical council ?
an " unnecessary " schism is a schism that occured as a result of misunderstood intentions of faith , where in actuality , both parties of the schism profess the same truth , i.e. a schism based on semantics .
i disagree .
a council does not define truth , but should uphold that which was already true before .
if a council decreed that arianism is correct , are we to say that __name1__ , which used to be false , is all of a sudden true ?
there would be no point in calling __name1__ " contra mundum , " but rather " contra truth ."
first , we have to take about papal beliefs .
the pope is in no authority alone to say a council is ecumenical or not .
it is a gathering of world patriarchs together that must profess truth based on the holy fathers and previous faith of other councils .
the pope is not the pope of the world , but only of __name1__ .
he locally effects __name1__ and its jurisdictions , and is not above other bishops of the world .
i think it 's more than just a difference in opinion on ecumenical councils .
we differ on papal beliefs as well , which lead to differences in ecumenicity of councils .
__name1__ bless you .
mina
i think __name1__ might have got the __name2__ vote anyhow but this should ensure it .

according to alof ben in __name1__ , the biggest loser in this war is __name2__ and the __name3__ party , and the theory of unilateral __name4__ withdrawals .
on the other hand , the war has strengthened the position of the right and its leader , __name1__ , and it helped to bring __name2__ back to the government .
but the most critical review is the __quant1__ by ben kasbit in __name1__ . he wrote : " did we win the war that broke out exactly __quant1__ year ago , or were we defeated ?
not exactly .
but since __name1__ must win the confrontation with its enemy , the draw equals a defeat .
is our position today better than what it was __quant1__ year ago on the eve of the war ?
is the position of __name1__ better today than it was __quant1__ year ago ?
no , the party has been dealt quite a major military blow , but from another point of view , it achieved an important moral victory .
it is true that it was pushed back off the border fence , but it is entrenching and fortifying itself to the north of the __name1__ .
it withstood its confrontation with the __name1__ military might , but it lost many of its troops and lost the element of surprise .

since the start of this campaign in __month1__ / " __month1__ " , warnings have been issued to thousands of women , among whom hundreds have been arrested for not abiding by the religious dress code .
women , whether __name1__ or foreign , have been required to wear the veil since the __name2__ in the year __year1__ , but recent years saw some relaxation , particularly with respect to wearing the veil .
the ministry requested that the officers of this committee hand over the persons whom they arrest to regular police forces , which are to carry out their own interrogations of them .
this religious police force is also under investigation following a campaign of raids during which an __name1__ woman fell to her death from the __month1__ floor last __month1__ in the region of holy __name2__ .
__name1__ - __name1__ stated that this religious police force was the object of more than 20 complaints in the year __year1__ .

the court also found that newnham had been convicted on charges of shoplifting from stores almost every year over a period of __quant1__ years .
newnham said that robbing the bank was much easier than sorting out his affairs and his retirement spending outside the prison .
the issue therefore does not concern some opinions that provoke waves of objection , but rather it fundamentally concerns a vision of the role of the __name1__ , its ideology , and its universal message .
so the beginning denied the relationship between __name1__ and reason , as though islam is a religion that is hostile to reason and there is no place for reason in the islamic faith .
the search for a war in which victory would be easy is in reality no more than an electoral campaign . this campaign can only succeed in electing or re - electing the neo - conservatives as leaders of the __name1__ . but it is a success whose price is to push the world toward destruction , fabricated crises that detract from the real challenges , and the absence of a compass and priorities .

nuclear reactor process --
__quant1__ meter fuel rods containing uranium oxide are burned to initiate fission -- the nucleus of the uranium atom is split , releasing neutrons that collide with other atoms , creating more neutrons in a chain reaction .
fission produces immense heat which is applied to water to create steam which drives turbines to generate electricity .
plutonium and other radioactive byproducts of the process accumulate and decrease the effectiveness of the rods until they are spent after 3 @-@ 4 years .
spent rods consisting of highly radioactive plutonium and residual uranium are cooled in pools of water for several years to diminish radioactivity and then the plutonium is then recovered in nitrate form and converted into oxide .
the recovered plutonium can be mixed with uranium for reuse in the reactor or used in making nuclear weapons .
nuclear experts stated that to make weapons , a high proportion of plutonium 239 ( military grade plutonium , as opposed to the commercial plutonium used in power plants ) must be extracted .

a foreign intelligence service provided a copy of the report to __name1__ .
the __name1__ government warned other governments in the report to exercise the most serious vigilance on their exports to __name2__ and iranian front companies .

the __name1__ government also secretly imported __quant1__ tons of nuclear material from __name2__ in __year1__ and processed some of this nuclear material in order to manufacture uranium metal .
this uranium would be of no use in __name1__ 's commercial program but would be integral to weapons production .

__name1__ has helped __name2__ for __quant1__ and is a __name3__ nuclear scientist regarded by the __name4__ as a purveyor of nuclear secrets .

__name1__ 's government announced withdrawal from the __name2__ arms control __name2__ hopes that the accompanying uncertainty will pressure __name3__ regarding various military , economic , and political issues .
the __name1__ government announced on __year1__ suspension of russian adherence to the __name2__ ( __name2__ ) arms control __name2__ .
the __name1__ is a key agreement that limits the deployment of forces in __name2__ and __name3__ .
__name1__ moves to install anti @-@ missile bases in the region were seen as a key cause of the decision .

independent defense analyst __name1__ said the __name2__ treaty is much more important to the __name3__ countries than the __name4__ .
__name1__ pointed out that __name2__ has other problems with __name3__ and that this withdrawal is another factor reducing confidence and deteriorating relations especially with european countries .
__name1__ predicted that actual troop deployments are unlikely to change much and believed the biggest practical effect of __name2__ 's decision will be an end to mutual inspections and confidence @-@ building measures governed by the treaty .
analysts said the hope in the __name1__ government is that the uncertainty will weaken __name2__ resolve over a number of issues .

editor of the __name1__ @-@ based journal russia in global affairs fyodor lukyanov said the __name2__ government is hoping that __name3__ 's extreme unease over this will lead to a softening of europe 's positions .
lukyanov thinks the __name1__ government 's calculations are wrong and that a frightened __name2__ will join with the __name3__ .
lukyanov said the decision to freeze the __name2__ was part of a wider move by the russian government to use newly found strength to remold the foundations of transatlantic relations and that the __name1__ government wants to revise the forces influencing interaction in the euro @-@ __name3__ area that were set when russia was weaker .
political analyst and director of __name2__ 's institute for globalization __name1__ said the __name3__ government also appears to be using its geopolitical strength to put pressure on __name4__ over business ties .
__name1__ said the withdrawal from the treaty will be seen in the __name2__ as an attempt to put pressure on a number of issues including in the economic sphere .
disagreements over energy security and a dispute over deliveries of __name1__ meat have prevented __name2__ and __name3__ authorities from agreeing to a new mutual cooperation agreement .
__name1__ said that at some stage the __name2__ government will put all of the economic issues on the table while expressing doubt whether the russian government 's goals will be achieved .

drug production will be a main focus of ministers , donors and aid agencies meeting in __name2__ on __day1__ __month2__ __year2__ through __day2__ __month2__ __year2__ to assess progress in __name1__ .
a paper prepared for the talks said the expansion of the narcotics industry represents the single greatest threat to afghanistanâ€™s stability and is increasingly linked to insecurity and terrorist activities .
the source of the document is the website of the joint coordination and monitoring board ( jcmb ) which is a committee working to implement __name1__ 's __quant1__ @-@ year reconstruction plan .

i remember my __value1__ year studying at __name1__ , i went to my __value1__ elective course called " inspirations in the history of physics . "
there were only ten or so of us who had chosen it that semester .
the teacher was very erudite , his lectures were very lively ; he summarized all of the recent and contemporary history of physics , and each time i was enthralled .
in all my __quant1__ years at the university , i never had another course that interesting .
if i were to summarize this course , it would be : the greatest discoveries in physics all had their own necessity and theoretical basis ( for example , the development of mathematics ) .
this theory can also be applied to cooking .
one day i wanted to make green beans and bean curd sheets ( dried tofu in the __name1__ ) .
here the dried tofu sold in the stores is all compressed , very tough .
so i normally steep it in hot water , then take it out and stir - fry it .
because that day i needed to go out in the middle of it and buy some things , i set the timer and told my wife to turn off the heat when it was done .
my wife is very lazy , and when the timer sounded , she turned off the heat and left the pot sitting on the stove .
when i came back and looked , the dried tofu was white and soft , just like freshly made .
chalk another good one up to the wife .
guo kai 's economic notes : your uncle is just your uncle .
guo kai 's economic notes
this morning i went to the supermarket with dad , and when it came time to check out i discovered something that everybody probably knows : not everybody buys the same things .
of course this is a no - brainer , but this is actually a major problem faced by me and many other people whenever we discuss economic issues or economic phenomena .
most of the time , economic policy and economic theory are not aimed at individuals .
in terms of probability , if you explain the behavior of a specific individual , for example your uncle , using any economic theory , the probability that it will be accurate is virtually 0 .
in fact , in the great majority of cases the economic theory is aimed at an entire group , or a subgroup .
in terms of averages , accuracy is the goal of many economic theories ( here i 'm being inaccurate ; i hope the experts will not take it too literally , especially those with io expertise ) .
but with regard to an ordinary person , he may never see the whole group , he sees only his co @-@ workers , his relatives and his friends , the group of people familiar to him ; add up all the people in this group and they may number __quant1__ , and that is already a lot of people .
below i am going to refer to these __quant1__ people collectively as " his uncle . "
so whenever you discuss an economic theory with someone , the response of a perfectly ordinary person would be : my uncle is n't like that , so this theory is baloney .
in other words , everybody tends to mistake the part for the whole .
here , mistaking the part for the whole is not derogatory ; it is a limitation of the human race itself ; you have it and i have it .
if __name1__ had learned not to mistake the part for the whole , they might not have made such a mess of the world .
i believe that they made such a complete mess of the __name1__ to a very large extent because they applied their own common sense to understanding the middle east , which is a completely different place from the united states .
on this issue , china does not have much basis for being self - congratulatory ; china 's rapid rise has even caused some people to have a sort of misconception - that whatever china does is right - and this is in fact a manifestation of narrow - mindedness .
therefore i believe it is extremely important to recognize that one 's own knowledge has limitations .
we need to maintain a sufficiently open attitude toward things that do n't correspond to our common sense .
so just because every time your uncle goes to the supermarket he buys hog head meat does n't mean that we should immediately assume that any theory that does not predict people going to the supermarket will buy hog head meat is wrong .
when you feel other people are talking baloney , and what other people say does not correspond to your " common sense , " you should at the same time recognize that your uncle is only your uncle , he is not the whole world .
well , gasoline in __name1__ has has hit $ 3.00 __quant1__ gallon , or just shy of it ,
and i spent $ __quant1__ filling up the gas tank of my __name1__ --
the most i 've ever paid for in my life .
i 'm not happy about it ,
but i do n't see high gas prices as a reason to start foaming at the mouth and chewing on the carpet .
others feel less constrained .
the hysteria over rising gas prices has reached a fever pitch .
the economic ignorance of the sound bites and commentary i 've seen on national television knows no bounds .
demagogues are calling for self - destructive taxes on oil company profits , oblivious to the reality that , in a capitalist society , profits are a critical signal that guide the flow of capital .
( 1 ) if you confiscate __name1__ 's profits , you reduce the capital available to the world 's largest oil company to invest in more exploratory drilling , new oil wells , new pipelines , new refineries , etc.
( 2 ) if you tax oil industry profits , you also reduce the incentive for owners of outside capital to invest in new capacity .
why bother if the profits will be taxed away ?
here in __name1__ , a semblance of sanity still reigns .
gov. __name1__ has not yet proposed anything as breath - takingly stupid as the proposals emanating from __name2__ , __name2__ .
the governor has said he will investigate reports of `` price gouging , '' which , given the fact that the the concept of `` price gouging '' is meaningless and impossible to define , means he will , for all practical purposes , do nothing ....
which is exactly what he should do .
nothing .
__name1__ and __name2__ will adapt to higher gas prices if government does not interfere .
( the governor also is considering applying for a waiver of federal regulations requiring cleaner gasoline be sold in __name1__ 's major metro areas , but has not yet made a determination .
see the __name1__ - __name1__ report .
unfortunately , he 's sticking to his guns on trying to raise $ __quant1__ for transportation projects without raising gasoline taxes -- a topic for another post .
as i have been hammering away relentlessly on this blog ( see `` a world with __quant2__ cars '' ) , the world economy is moving from a __quant1__ - year era of cheap petroleum to a plateau of more expensive petroleum .
this shift is driven by the combination of ( a ) escalating world consumption of petroleum , especially in rapidly developing economies like __name1__ and __name2__ , and ( b ) the peaking of global oil production capacity , the increasing expense of exploiting the remote and isolated oil reserves that remain , and terrorist / political instability in oil - producing countries .
this is not the oil companies ' fault .
this is not __name1__ 's fault .
this is not the auto industries ' fault .
it is not the environmentalists ' fault .
it 's the reality of geology and geopolitics .
the __name1__ public can adapt to the new global realities by changing their energy - intensive lifestyles ,
and politicians can help them by speaking honestly and forthrightly about why the price of gasoline is increasing , instead of demagoguing the issue for short - term political gain .
here in virginia , the __name1__ has been examining what __name2__ can do to increase energy production .
that is ok , as far as it goes .
but there is nothing that __name1__ can do to increase the global supply of oil , and probably little it can do to increase the petroleum refining capacity needed to convert oil to gasoline .
what the political and business leadership of __name1__ has so far failed utterly to do is admit that virginia is acutely vulnerable to oil price shocks .
__name1__ consume more gasoline per capita than the national average , in part because our transportation policy is geared toward matching every increase in automobile travel with an increase in transportation capacity with no thought of modulating travel demand .
but reality is a stubborn thing .
with each increase in the price of gasoline , the bankruptcy of the old order becomes increasingly evident .
let us hope that gov. __name1__ , who prides himself on straight talk , begins leveling with the people of __name2__ .
jim - you are right on the money about how capitalism works ,
so why not try to make capitalism really work for __name1__ .
the future in transportation belongs to the nation , company or person who develops the alternative to gasoline powered automobiles .
why not do everything we can to assure that future arises from __name1__ ?
rather than drilling for oil and gas off the __name1__ , we should be offering enormous incentives for comapnies and individuals who want to work on alternative fuel solutions to locate their business here .
you can encourage r&d on alternative fuels with grants and tax breaks .
and , you can work to increase supply .
the one and only oil refinery in the __name1__ is nearby in __name2__ .
they could double their capacity without leaving the premises .
why has n't the company applied to do builf new facilities on site ?
by all means explore for oil and gas in the __name1__ .
jim : speaking seriously here , many families ( including my own ) have already cut back in every way possible .
what then ?
my office , home and children 's schools are all within a __quant1__ mile radius .
vacations are already a thing of the past .
we 've cut back on groceries .
i 'd trade the car on a hybrid ,
but it 's paid for
and who can afford a car payment what with mortgage rates being what they are and __quant1__ kids ...
so , i ask seriously , what are average hard - working families to do ?
andrea : how about a couple of __quant1__ dollars ?
if the __name1__ repealed the unnecessary sales tax from last year , then the average citizen would pick up some cash .
or , the __name1__ could actually cut the sales tax
and you would keep some more of your money .
check out how much the __name1__ senators want you to pay in other , new taxes too - to register your car , etc.
jim : i like the graphic ,
it takes __quant1__ arms and __quant2__ legs to fill up our tank .
the only answer to cutting the cost of mobility and access is settlement patterns that require less vehicle travel and support more effecient shared - vehicles when one must resort to any vehicle .
that is what an understanding of __name1__ suggested __quant1__ years ago ( not just in `` __name2__ ... but also `` the economy of ' cities ' . ''
let us , honor __name1__ 's memory with an understanding of the need for fundamental change .
emr
jab - got ta love it .
yup , a couple of __quant1__ dollars is going to save the day !
__name1__ knew the difference between a community and a construction plan .
was n't one of her main arguments that you can not plan everything , and you should allow communities to be what they are and what they become ?
did n't she fight __name1__ because he thought he had too much control over other peoples ' lives ?
somehow i doubt she would have gotten on board with fundamental change if it involved massive central and regional planning .
andrea , __quant1__ option may be telecommuting a couple of days __quant1__ week .
other than that , here 's the hard truth :
there 's not much that average , hard - working families can do in the short run to cope with higher gas prices except hope that their paychecks keep pace with inflation .
what you should not do is support demagogic political ploys that make problems worse , not better .
in the longer run , you can support more pedestrian friendly , transit - friendly development patterns that give you and your family more transportation options .
you should support development patterns that allow compatible uses ( houses , small office buildings , small retail shops ) to be located close to each rather than scattered all over .
how much money could you save if you could get by with only __quant1__ car instead of __quant2__ ?
what would it mean if you lived in a place where your children could walk to school ?
think outside the box .
kingfish , i 'm all in favor of alternate fuels .
converting biomass to ethanol seems to be one that is self - sustaining economically without massive incentives .
i 'd favor government - sponsored research to devise technologies that would make ethanol more competitive ,
but i do n't like the idea of subsidizing specific business enterprises .
once you give them a subsidy , they never let go , no matter how much the world changes around them .
witness the mohair subsidies put into place during __name1__ .
i tend to agree with jim that markets function best , so long as no one has a finger on the scale .
many believe that zone pricing , which is generally used by oil companies , is inconsistent with our antitrust laws ( section __value1__ of the __name1__ - __name1__ ) .
others disagree .
does zone pricing constitute a finger on the scale ?
if so , should the __name1__ outlaw zone pricing ?
toomanytaxes : zone pricing is the mechanism the oil companies use to make sure that we pay the same price as people in states with higher gas taxes .
only , we pay the extra few cents per gallon to them rather than into our state transportation accounts .
considering the wide variety in local and state fuel taxes the near uniformity of the pump price across state lines is ... curious .
i was recently on the webpage for the __name1__
and their cost of fuel adjusted for inflation chart demonstates that we have been at $ __quant1__ per gallon measured in __year1__ dollars before .
it is about the historic peak in real prices ,
but it is hardly unprecedented , and not worth quite the hype or hysteria it is generating .
it is hard to imagine a company or a family that can not improve its efficiency and reduce consumption ,
and that is not a bad outcome at all .
like you , jim , i see the bright silver lining .
i seem to be getting more questions whenever i pull up in my hybrid .
__quant1__ data point .
__time1__ @:@ __time1__ why are gas prices often significantly different for the same brand between __name1__ and __name2__ counties and even at different locations within the same county ?
zone pricing is trying to do much more than reflect different tax rates .
take a look at the following link : __value1__
assuming the general accuracy of the data underlying the map ,
differences in do not explain zone pricing .
look at __name1__ , for example .
there are much higher transportation costs in and around the __name1__ and much more competition in the __name2__ market .
yet , __name1__ prices tend to be signficantly higher .
ditto for taxes .
from what i quickly found on the internet , total fuel taxes for the following __quant5__ states are __name1__ ( __quant1__ cents ) ; __name2__ ( __quant2__ cents ) ; __name3__ ( __quant3__ cents ) and __name4__ ( __quant4__ cents ) .
however , both __name1__ and __name2__ have average prices that are significantly lower than either __name3__ or __name4__ .
there 's probably less relationship to costs and zone pricing than the oil companies want the public to believe .
i had a conversation with a friend the other day who owns an suv
and he is n't worried about the price of gas because he travels less than __quant1__ miles a day ..
yes ..
it 'll cost more ...
so he 'll have to cut back on his gourmet coffee ... __quant1__ cups rather than __quant2__ . :-)
seriously - it 's about how far folks choose to drive and how folks define phrases like `` i must and have no choice '' .
it takes a hard knock for folks to take a hard look at things they always assumed could not change .
i predict ... lots of folks will be taking harder looks at whether or not choices are choices or no choice '' is truly no choice .
i know it happened during the gas crisis ...
and as bad as it is now - this is not as bad as then - though if $ __quant1__ a gallon is in the rear view mirror and $ __quant2__ a gallon on the horizon and coming fast ... we might think so ...
.. but i would bet that folks would choose ( there 's that word again ) $ __quant1__ or even $ __quant2__ a gallon rather than waiting in line for __quant3__ hours only to find out the guy in front of you got the __value1__ tankful .
__name1__ 's love affair with the automobile is about to be revisted though i doubt seriously a divorce is anywhere near ... :-)
sorry .. my attitude is grin and bear it ...
it 's sort of like coffee doubling in price ...
my property accessment going up __value1__ % ( which it did ) ...
... and today .. i paid $ __quant1__ bucks to fill up my 89 __name1__ van .
i got ta talk to ray hyde about that hybrid .... he 's got ..
he said if he had to choose .. he 'd keep his truck ... :-)
did i really say that ?
that would be a tough `` choice '' .
with the truck i 'd have some chance of making money ,
but i 'd hate to have to drive it if it was n't working .
if you have to drive , the hybrid is a joy .
dead silent , dirt cheap , reliable , little bit of capital cost detriment , sufficient power .
__quant1__ mpg if you drive at 75+ like a maniac .
i remember people sniffing at it , saying they would n't do it because the payback on capital was n't there .
i drone on about costs and benefits , but a ) that 's not everything , and b ) sometimes circumstances change .
i 'm going to have to send a letter to the guv'nor .
i have a bunch of vehicles and only use the appropriate one for the task at hand .
i need a portable license plate and insurance , otherwise the current `` tax '' plan is going to kill me .
i sure hope that those of you who think saving open space and farms will chip in and help out on this :
send a letter .
i do n't mind paying what it costs to drive or paying what i owe ,
but this is going to be whacked .
i suspect that overhead costs might have something to do with fuel prices .
that gas station in __name1__ is sitting on expensive land and paying high taxes .
businesses are `` tax positive '' do n't cha know .
if people really do start making different choices , it 's going to be fun to watch real estate prices .
btw __value1__ % more new home sales last year , in spite of higher rates ,
but prices were down 5k .
time to demand another reassessment .
ray hyde : taxes are indeed business overhead that affect retail prices .
but i still suggest that zone pricing has more to do with computer software and data - mining than actual costs .

if you 're __name2__ county , you create a new vision for the boxy buildings and subterranean passageways in __name1__ that will be emptied by the federal base realignment and closure commission .
in place of the sterile monoculture that now characterizes the office complex near the __name1__ , members of an advisory task force see a more lively street - level scene with a greater mix of shops , restaurants and offices .
writes wapo reporter annie gowen :
[ __name1__ chairman chris ] zimmerman and others speaking yesterday said that the vounty sees the empty space as an opportunity to `` reimagine '' and `` brand '' __name2__ as an attractive destination .
though close to __name1__ and dense with hotels , the area has long been seen as a gloomy __decade1__ s era enclave of offices connected by underground passages .
but parts of __name1__ have lately seen a rebirth , thanks to an influx of trendy cafes and a new streetscape ....
__name1__ , which owns __quant1__ of the __quant2__ square feet of office space in the neighborhood , has spent $ __quant3__ on improvements to enliven the streets and attract new businesses .
it turned crystal drive into a two - way main street and has recruited new shops and chic restaurants such as jaleo and __name1__ .
reading between the lines of gowen 's story , however , there seems to be one big missing piece :
housing .
creating a livelier commercial district is a worthy goal .
but creating a balanced community with a mix of housing , offices , shopping and other amenities -- allowing people to live close to where they work and play -- is an even more worthy goal .
as ed risse has pointed out , the relocation of __quant1__ jobs creates a rare opportunity to create a genuine balanced communities in __name1__ .
the problem , i surmise -- it 's not discussed in the story -- is that __name1__ is concerned about protecting its tax base , which means replacing the vacated offices with new offices , not housing .
it 's hard to fault __name1__ for pursuing its short - term self interest .
but everyone needs to recognize that __name1__ 's decision not to pursue a balanced community means that housing will end up somewhere else , presumably in outlying counties .
and employees working in the buffed up __name1__ will wind up commuting long distances and clogging __name2__ thoroughfares .
so i work in that same beauty salon ,
i 'm chained to the old masquerade
the lipstick , the shadow , the silicone :
i follow my father 's trade -
__name1__
__name1__ may be another example of a celebrity distraction which , upon examination , reveals more about our society 's mortal condition than a tabloid could imagine .
almost certainly more than it would dare to describe .
yesterday , __name1__ was ordered to close __name2__ for having failed to pay the ranch 's __quant1__ employees their salary or insurance since the end of __year1__ .
unfortunate for the unpaid staff and the abandoned llamas but no surprise .
he 's moved on since his aquittal , like __name1__ did after his __year1__ conviction , having departed last __month1__ for a __name2__ `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
( '' for the people working at __name2__ 's malls , the person covered head to toe in a black veil , gloves and glasses appeared to be a rich , doting __name1__ mother ....
but why would a woman wear a man 's shoes ?
why the bodyguards ?
and why did the person 's fluid movements seem so familiar ? '' )
last week 's real __name1__ story ran in the __name2__ , under the snappy banner `` creepy dad was root of all clan 's woe , singer sez . ''
the singer was brother __name1__ , and the claims based on the projected outline for his abandoned `` tell - all '' family story .
reading that __name1__ was a nightmare of a father and sexually abusive towards his daughters is not exactly a `` stop the presses '' moment .
what 's new is this :
__name1__ even suggested his father may have set up __name2__ to be somehow victimized by older men .
he tells how his father would have __name1__ join in at late - night hotel room meetings with `` important business people , '' and wondered whether `` something happened '' to michael at those sessions .
he said he sensed something was wrong because __name1__ would be sick for days after .
`` what was __name2__ doing ? '' __name1__ wrote .
this lifts the __name1__ family horror show to a whole new order of dysfunction , one that sees parents network with power and trade their children for privilege .
this should be a motif familiar to anyone acquainted with the literature of mind control and ritual abuse survivors : the father and __value1__ controller , passing his child - victim up the social ladder of abuse in return for status , protection and reward .
or maybe not : `` __name1__ also described being awakened in the night by __name2__ wearing a ' monster mask . ' ''
perhaps we can take more from this than the suspicion that the __name1__ clan had gotten with the program .
perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre @-@ existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect .
( this is how i tend to think of __name1__ 's hosanna church . )
yet we should n't discount the suspicion , either , particularly given some of __name1__ 's paranormal interests and peculiar associations .
his close friendship with spectra contactee and channeller of __name2__ , __name1__ , for one instance .
( __name1__ was __name2__ 's best man in __year1__ when he and his wife renewed his vows , the same year __name2__ is said to have been reactivated as a psychic spy . )
his entourage including a `` personal magician '' for another .
even if you wanted to , you wo n't be reading __name1__ 's account now .
like every __name2__ sibling who 's tried to break from __name3__ , he 's climbed down , returned to the fold and scrapped the book , apparently on the strength of __name1__ 's threats to sue .
previously , __name1__ 's given cause for family observers to attribute his grotesque body dysmorphia to a dread of resembling his father .
yet there they were at __name1__ 's trial last year , hand in hand .
but his little picture may be more newsworthy than the news suggests .
good stuff .
having departed last __month1__ for a __name1__ `` vacation '' from which he 's yet to emerge .
actually , there have been reports for the past __quant1__ days of __name1__ back in __name2__ .
#name ?
wild wild stuff jeff !
disinformation distraction dis and dat ..
bait and switch sets the agenda .
there is no such thing as an accident .
it 's saturday morning , and the papers say a moon of __name1__ is spewing life - giving water .... then i see the new r.i. post is about the perrenial child __name2__ .
this day is named for __name1__ ...
" ... it was foretold that one day a mighty son of __name1__ would in turn overthrow him ,
and __name1__ devoured all of his children when they were born to prevent this ... ''
apparently __name1__ is also intimately connected with __name2__ , masonics , and revelation 13 - you know , the `` number of the beast '' ...
nevermind -
__quant1__ need __quant1__ cup of coffee ...
i looked in vain for the __name1__ `` a hunting we will go '' to post this out and paste but ...
and on the subject of cowardice , consider this . in a recent hunting escapade , __name1__ accidentally shot one of his hunting comrades .
there may have been negligence involved , but that is up to the local district attorney to decide .
but more importantly , i think , is the nature of the hunt .
these were not wild birds .
the birds were bred in captivity .
they had spent their lives in pens , and then on hunting day , were released for the sole purpose of being killed by __name1__ and cohorts for pure sport as they flew into the open sky for their only moments of brief freedom .
the link `` personal majician '' is intrigueing .
from madsen via boucher :
__name5__ 's stay at the cedars was arranged through __name1__ , __name4__ 's __name3__ director __name2__ the __name2__ - __name2__ .
__name1__ also previously worked for the __name2__ and senator __name3__ .
there 's also some curious __name1__ / __name2__ connections to the `` __name3__ '' children who are now stars , including __name4__ ( remember the star on __name7__ 's breast ? ) and brittany __name5__ , __name6__ ...
the piper walks into the mountain , still followed by the children , and the cave closes again ...
here is boucher 's follow up to the `` majician '' link of jeff 's .
but i thought you might cover __name1__ 's inauguration of its __value1__ woman president today instead ...
maybe later as the story develops ?
jeff boucher 's piece mentions how victims of sexual abuse often have childlike voices , almost as if their development was ' frozen ' around the time of their abuse .
__name1__ seems to be of this type .
or more perversely , fakes that he is :
`` i was always saying [ to __name1__ ] people would n't think i was so crazy if they saw who the hell you really are , that you sit around , and you drink and you curse and you 're [ expletive ] funny and you have a bad mouth , and you do n't have that high voice all the time '' -
__name1__ , in an interview quoted in a __name2__ article written by __name3__ :
__name1__ 's false front ?
`` __name1__ , be gone !
__name1__ , be gone ! ''
the witch doctor cursing __name1__ 's enemies and blessing the tarnished king of pop himself in a voodoo ritual in __name2__ in the summer of __year1__ had promised that the __quant1__ people on jackson 's enemies list ( would soon be dead ) ...
__name1__ had ordered his then business adviser , myung - ho lee , a u.s. - educated korean lawyer based in seoul , to wire $ __quant1__ to a bank in __name2__ for a voodoo chief named baba , who then had __quant2__ cows ritually sacrificed for the ceremony .
__name1__ had already undergone a blood bath ...
the pop star , who is said to be $ __quant1__ in debt , had paid __quant2__ figures for a ritual cleansing using sheep blood to another voodoo doctor and a mysterious __name1__ woman named samia , who came to him with a letter of greeting from a high - ranking saudi prince , purportedly __name2__ - __name2__ , now the chief of intelligence of __name3__ ...
__value1__ hmm .
according to that __name1__ article , __name2__ and __name3__ met through `` that other fellow devotee of children 's charities __name4__ , the chairman of __name8__ in __name9__ , who believes that the c.i.a. and __name5__ had __name6__ and his son , __name7__ , killed . ''
anonymous quoted , `` __name2__ 's stay at the cedars was arranged through __name1__ ... ''
hold on --
the cedars is the headquarters of the __name1__ , the creepy christianoid cult with deep political connections .
here 's a bit of the original madsen article that the __name1__ quote comes from :
in __year1__ , the __name1__ began looking for a permanent headquarters in __name2__ .
it set its sights on the estate of __name1__ , the cedars , located at 2301 north uhle street .
__name1__ was one of the drafters of the __name2__ .
the __name1__ , also known as the international foundation , bought the property from charles piluso .
although not much is known about piluso , the __name1__ reported that __name2__ , the man with whom __name4__ senator __name3__ once sparred , also lived there .
according to a senior __name1__ official , the cedars had been used as a __name2__ safe house prior to the __name3__ 's purchase of the estate .
the __name1__ paid $ __quant1__ for the cedars , the money coming from tom phillips , the ceo of __name2__ , and __name3__ , the ceo of __name4__ .
__name1__ of mcdonnell douglas corporation was another deep - pocketed supporter of the __name2__ through __name3__ , an activity linked to __name3__ core member __name4__ .
suffer the little children , eh ?
if this is what power & wealth does to you , i 'm damn glad i have neither .
you said , `` perhaps rather the point is that the program exploits pre @-@ existing conditions for abuse which are more common than most suspect . ''
could n't agree more .
i think that pedophilia 's relative commonality is what really makes it frightening .
my experience happened when i was __quant1__ .
a friend of mine met this guy who was twice our age & who was more than willing to buy us all the whiskey we could drink .
we were both enamored with __name1__ & __name2__ & meeting strange characters & this guy definitely fit the bill .
he was muscle for a __name1__ madam named tex gill .
she dressed like a man & ran most of the massage parlors in pgh .
he was into black magick & __name1__ & booze & drugs & on & on .
& my buddy passes out .
i continue drinking .
at one point , i glance at this older guy ,
& he is staring at my buddy as a line of drool runs down the cigarette in his mouth & drips on to the floor .
he notices that i 'm kind of staring at him .
he stands up , walks into the bedroom , & comes back with a porno mag .
he drops it on the couch next to me .
as he 's sitting down , he says , `` see anything you like ? ''
& then he shoves his hand hard into my groin .....
.... & i broke his nose with my elbow .
i apologize for continuing my ramble but ... ,
__name1__
manchild in a promised land
by robert j. lewis
he 's such an easy target , __name1__ .
he makes even the weirdest of the weird feel normal .
but unlike them , __name1__ does n't try to hide the fact that he is easily one of the most screwed up beings on the planet .
every time he checks in for yet another surgery , he is announcing to the world that he does n't know who he is , where he is going , and that he thoroughly loathes himself - at least the adult version .
and for his remarkable honesty , his most unprivate confessions , he is subjected to one public humiliation after another .
who among us rock throwers would have the courage to reveal about ourselves what __name1__ has revealed about himself ?
next to the towering monument that the unedited __name1__ is we are telephone booths ;
next to his singular guilelessness and candor , we are the multitude of the prevaricating and pusillanimous .
everything __name1__ has done and said during the past __quant1__ years has been against his own apparent self - interest , beginning with unrelenting surgical assaults on his erstwhile good looks , to hanging his child ( and crotch for that matter ) out to dry , to entering details of his bedroom antics into the public domain .
like a typical dostoievksy character , we can not account for the behavior if it were n't for an apparently overriding need to confess and proclaim -- over and against what the outside world wants to believe -- the truth of who we are .
the on - going spectacle of __name1__ 's increasingly bizarre conduct is his confession to the world that he is one spectacularly psychologically - challenged dude .
like children who are incapable of dissimulating their basic wants and needs , __name1__ 's manner of being in the world is uncensored and spontaneous ,
and to such an unsuspected extent i propose he deserves to be considered __quant1__ of the most authentic beings of this or any other century , and quite properly belongs to that exceptional society of authenticity - questers that would include __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ .
the facts of __name1__ 's life have been well documented .
we know that by the age of __quant1__ he was on top of the world .
thriller had sold an unprecedented __quant1__ copies and __name1__ had become the musical drug of choice in every corner of the world .
not only was the song 's momentum and tension brilliantly crafted and fused , __name1__ 's riveting , counterpoint choreography - which remains unsurpassed -- revolutionized the way we simultaneously look at and listen to music .
before disbelieving eyes , his torso , head and limbs supplied never - before - seen anatomical rejoinders to the notes -- like a guitarist filling in between the lyrics .
but from here on in , it would be downhill for the genre 's quintessential messenger , for __name1__ could no longer sustain the ' great lie ' he was living .
the child 's ' tin drum ' was beating ever louder in his head
and he intuitively understood that he was developmentally under - equipped to handle the adult pressures of stardom .
far more compelling than the promise of even greater fame and fortune was the example of oskar , from gunther __name2__ ' __name1__ ( __year1__ ) , which tells the story of a boy who refuses to grow up , who , through his drumming , rejects the adult world and the horrors taking place in __name4__ __name3__ .
like oskar , __name1__ had witnessed firsthand the abominations of adult behaviour and refused to sign up .
from his earliest years , __name1__ was subjected to both extreme psychological and physical abuse at the hands of his status - obsessed father , who designated michael as the vessel into which he would mercilessly pour the acid of his unrealized ambitions .
to this single end , __name1__ was ruthlessly single - minded .
__name1__ was terrified of him , whose mere presence could induce nausea .
at the age of __quant1__ , the father yanked the son from his pail and sandbox existence and made him run __name1__ 's grimmest gauntlets .
the little mouse that __name1__ was suddenly found himself in the rat race and quickly learned to hate it ,
and like oskar , who found respite in the beating of his tin drum , __name1__ found solace on stage , performing his music .
but the stage could not provide __name1__ with immunity against the constant encroachment of the adult world .
listen to his rapid breathing in especially __name1__ and __name2__ : the staccato - like panting of a stalked animal , the desperate breath of human panic , and his small boy 's voice hiding behind the mesmerizing slash and blur of arms and legs fending off an invisible attack .
from one track to the next , the lyrics are n't so much sung as frantically whispered , the vowels cut short to the quick .
__name1__ was announcing that he could no longer follow the course father and __name2__ had staked out for him , that the disparity between his real self and the role he was thrust into had reached unsustainable incommensurability .
only the child within could save the defenceless adult from the depredations of the adult world ,
and from this point on , __name1__ would reduce the project of his life to letting the world know the truth of who he was : a confused , fragile , lost soul in search of care and love .
by the time __name1__ had attained mythic status , he was so far removed and alienated from himself , he would have to shed , over a period of __quant1__ years and still counting , one skin after another before his true self could begin to emerge .
as we might expect from someone so radically self - estranged , the result has been nothing less than a metamorphosis .
__name1__ 's journey of self - discovery is a work in progress like no other because it increasingly depends on the accommodation of __quant1__ irreconcilables : the child and adult as one .
more revealing of itself than its favorite target , public opinion has not seen fit to grant __name1__ the inalienable right to his confused mental state and ' off the wall ' comportment .
if most people subscribe to the notion that black and white are not only skin colors but states of mind , why are we baffled or offended when __name1__ , who was introduced to the white ways of __name2__ at the age of __quant1__ , tells us that he is n't sure what his true color is ?
robbed of his childhood , abused by a psychotic father and then prematurely subjected to the adult pressures of the entertainment world , why are we surprised to learn that __name1__ does n't want to grow up , that he prefers the company and community of children , that he wants to be protected and looked after ?
every time the androgynous __name1__ goes under the knife he is crying out that he does n't know if he is man or woman , child or adult , black or white .
as if we would have done otherwise in his situation ?
and to the never - ending suspicion that __name1__ is a child abuser , what crime has been committed when __quant1__ experimenting __quant2__ - year - olds fool around sexually ?
if you believe that __name1__ has the mentality of an __quant1__ - year - old , ( and there has n't been much evidence to the contrary during the past __quant2__ years ) he should not have had to defend himself against accusations of child molestation .
was it in defense of perversity or his incorrigible innocence that convinced him that it was ok to reveal that he shared his bed with children ?
more questionable , even criminal , than __name1__ 's alleged fooling around with other kids , were the parents who allowed , even encouraged their children to sleep over and perhaps share the same bed with someone whose sexual predilections have been suspect since __year1__ .
on __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ , the courts found __name1__ not guilty of the charges brought against him .
however , those whose minds were decided on his guilt before the trial began will not be changed by the verdict , just as __name1__ 's essential nature will not have changed .
__name1__ writes that ' there is a higher court than courts of justice and that is the court of conscience . '
only __name1__ knows if he is sexually attracted to children , and beyond that , if he has ever acted on those feelings .
and if we grant him the mental age of an __quant2__ - year - old , who has nonetheless conventionally fathered __quant1__ children , __name1__ is then a child trapped in an adult body .
which means the crowning act in his quest for authenticity awaits __quant1__ final operation .
what does a man do when he feels , acts and responds like a woman trapped in a man 's body ?
he undergoes sexual reassignment surgery and hormone therapy in order to become who ' she ' is .
there remains __quant1__ final procedure that will totally liberate the child that __name1__ is .
when __name2__ finds the courage to act on what his duty toward other children demands -- submit to voluntary neutering -- which will be tantamount to his final confession , the saving grace and glory that is his __name1__ will become his forever land .
__name1__ has said for all time , `` there 's not enough kindness in the world . ''
and i say this to you , __name1__ , may your tribe increase .
`` thank __name1__ i 'm an atheist : ''
the surrealistic cinema of __name1__ --
by bryan m. papciak
`` the thought of death has been familiar to me for a long time , '' says director __name1__ .
`` from the time that skeletons were carried through the streets of __name1__ during the __name2__ procession , death has been an integral part of my life .
i 've never wished to forget or deny it ,
but there 's not much to say about it when you 're an atheist '' ( 255 ) .
so reads an accurate testimonial to the personal and artistic sentiment of this odd and serious filmmaker .
like many of his contemporary surrealists , __name1__ is a paradox who on one hand claims apathy towards ultimate end , being , and being , yet on the other hand loads his impressive body of work with moribund imagery and strange ideas about the __name2__ he so vociferously denies .
__name1__ exhibits a radical , iconoclastic view of the world in which he finds society decadent and antithetical to human liberation .
he has been called a realist , a surrealist , a marxist , an anarchist , a mystic , an anticleric , a freudian , a post @-@ freudian , a sadist , a moralist , a __name1__ , and a poet - showman of the macabre .
his scenarios range from the absurd to the tragic to the satiric to the erotic , profusely endued with the outrageous and the scandalous .
__name2__ has long been recognized in __name1__ critical circles as a great and prolific filmmaker on a par with __name3__ , __name4__ , and __name5__ .
however , only recently has his reputation in __name1__ begun to catch up .
over his __quant2__ - year career he directed __quant1__ feature films and worked in __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ , __name4__ , and the __name5__ .
utilizing sardonic humor and the imagery of surrealism , __name1__ set out to undermine the values and institutions people take for granted .
his aims were specific : through the surreal , visualizing the impulses of the uncon - scious , he would , he said , `` shatter the optimism of the bourgeoisie world and force the reader ( or spectator ) to question the permanency of the prevailing order '' ( __name1__ 3 ) .
__name1__ was born __month1__ __day1__ , __year1__ in __name2__ , a small town in the province of __name3__ , __name4__ .
as a youth he received a __name1__ education , displaying exceptional talent in music , athletics , and the natural sciences .
he enjoyed a comfortable upbringing in a reasonably wealthy , close - knit family .
his family came from liberal , semi @-@ intellectual , land - owning bourgeoisie .
these details are not irrelevant .
to comprehend __name1__ 's works it is essential to understand that he was first a __name2__ and secondly a product of spanish bourgeoisie .
virginia higgenbotham points out that `` blasphemy is only a form of thinking for any intelligent __name1__ , '' and also that the `` art of his country is rich in eroticism and profoundly preoccupied with death '' ( 18 , 20 ) .
__name1__ says : my infancy slipped by in an almost medieval atmosphere ( like that of nearly all the __name2__ provinces ) between my native town and zaragova .
i feel it necessary to say here ( since it explains in part the trend of the modest work which i later accomplished ) that the __quant1__ basic sentiments of my childhood which stayed with me well into adolescence , are those of a profound eroticism , at first sublimated in a great religious faith , and a permanent consciousness of death .
it would take too long here to analyze the reasons .
it suffices that i was not an exception among my compatriots , since this is a very __name1__ characteristic , and our art , exponent of the spanish spirit , was impregnated with these __quant1__ sentiments .
the last civil war , peculiar and ferocious as no other exposed them clearly .
coming of age , __name1__ expressed a strong urge to go to __name2__ to study music but was sent instead to __name3__ to study agricultural engineering .
after a few years , he switched his studies to entomology , and , more importantly , began forming close friendships with a group of young artists who were to influence him strongly in the future .
these companions included the poets __name1__ and __name2__ and the painter __name3__ .
in the __name2__ residencia __name1__ developed his interest in the arts , theater , and acting and gained his introduction to surrealism .
after graduating in __year1__ with a degree in philosophy and letters , __name1__ moved to __name2__ , joined by a few members of his residencia coterie .
__name1__ arrived in __name2__ highly recommended by influential friends of his parents and was introduced into the best intellectual circles of the city .
he was soon hired as an assistant director to __name1__ epstien , `` the only director of that bleak era of the __name2__ cinema to merit the title of an intellectual filmmaker '' ( aranda 32 ) .
while honing his skills working as an a.d. , __name1__ also began contributing articles to various literary cinema periodicals , most notably la gaceta hispanoamericana .
in __year1__ he formally entered the paris surrealist group .
within this setting he embarked on his __value1__ film project as director , a collaboration with his residencia friend __name1__ , entitled __name2__ .
he collaborated with __name1__ again in __year1__ on another surrealist film , l_age d ' or .
the rest , as they say , is history .
some critics , most notably __name1__ and __name2__ , now regard __name3__ as the __name4__ of surrealism -- a venerated master in total command of his medium and for whom the art of filmic manipulation became a `` delightful form of play . ''
for __name1__ , however , play had little to do with it .
rather , he saw surrealism as a revolutionary , poetic , and moral movement :
all of us were supporters of a certain concept of revolution , and although the surrealists did n't consider themselves terrorists , they were constantly fighting a society they despised .
the principle weapon was not guns , of course , it was scandal .
scandal was a potent agent of revelation , capable of exposing such social crimes as exploitation of one man by another , colonialist imperialism , religious tyranny -- in sum , all the secret and odious underpinnings of a system that had to be destroyed .
he went on to say , `` the purpose of surrealism was not to create a new literary , artistic , or even philosophical movement , but to explode the social order , to transform life itself ' ( 107 ) .
__name1__ recalled the surrealists ' ideology , `` it is possible to systematize confusion thanks to a paranoia and active process of thought and so assist in discrediting completely the world of reality '' ( gould 37 ) .
indeed , the intent of surreal art is to move one from the conscious mind into the subconscious .
it seeks to affect the emotions through the mind .
michael gould states in surrealism and the cinema , `` if the vision revealed is too much for the rational mind to absorb ( too intense , too threatening , too ' real ' ) yet can not be rejected , then it leaves the consciousness and comes to exist on a sublime level as pure surrealism '' ( 13 ) .
in __name1__ , for example , a girl 's eye is sliced with a razor blade ,
a man wipes his mouth completely off his face ,
dead donkey carcasses adorn a piano ,
a man 's hand crawls with ants .
each of these images is clearly too intense for rational thought .
__name1__ was drawn to the surrealist movement for more than revolutionary or psychological reasons .
the moral aspects of the movement intrigued him as well :
for the __value1__ time in my life , i 'd come into contact with a coherent moral system that , as far as i could tell , had no flaws .
it was an aggressive morality based on the complete rejection of all existing values .
we had other criteria :
we exalted passion , mystification , black humor , the insult , and the call of the abyss .
inside this new territory , all our thoughts and actions seemed justifiable ;
there was simply no room for doubt .
everything made sense .
our morality may have been more demanding and more dangerous than the prevailing order , but it was also stronger , richer , more coherent .
the surreal qualities in __name1__ 's films can be traced to a number of sources ,
but the primary impetus was his `` irrational sensibility '' as evidenced by his treatment of image , montage , and sound .
these gave his films their dreamlike quality .
his most intense images are evocative of either humor or mystery .
mystery , he believed , is the essential element of any art ;
it is inseparable from chance ,
and the whole universe is a mystery ,
__name1__ believed that his own form of atheism led inevitably to the acceptance of the inexplicable .
`` since i reject the idea of a divine watchmaker , '' he said , `` ( a notion even more mysterious than the mystery it supposedly explains ) , then i must consent to live in a kind of shadowy confusion ....
at least it keeps my moral freedom intact '' ( 174 ) .
predictably , adherence to fantasy as opposed to reason in a rationalistic society leads to conflict .
the surrealists opposed nearly all traditional values and , as noted before , sought to destroy `` all conventional social , moral , and artistic habits of thought and perception '' ( higgenbotham 30 ) .
enter __name1__ .
in __year1__ , __name1__ was as shocking and scandalous as __name2__ and __name3__ had hoped it would be .
it gave rise to a staggering range of interpretations : poetic , scandalous , incoherent , an attack upon critics , an attack upon religion , and attack upon the bourgeoisie .
( interestingly , the film was financed by __name1__ 's bourgeois mother . )
__name1__ ( which means __name2__ -- though there are no dogs in the film ) was deliberately intended to jolt the spectator 's peace of mind and to convey some of the basic beliefs underlying the surrealist movement , including the omnipotence of desire .
__name1__ stated that he and __name2__ held to only __quant1__ rule during the production ,
`` no idea or image that might lend itself to rational explanation of any kind would be accepted .
we had to open all doors to the irrational and keep only those images that surprised us without trying to explain why '' ( 104 ) .
the aim of the film was not exclusively to shock , but to incendiarially affect the collective conscience .
at the same time it was an indictment of all the art consumers who , either through stupidity , masochism , or self interest , were willing to swallow anything , no matter how much it went against their instincts .
__name1__ asked , `` what can i do about the people who adore all that is new , even when it goes against their deepest convictions , or about the insincere , corrupt press and the inane herd that saw beauty and poetry in something which was basically no more than a desperate call for murder ? '' ( bauche 9 ) .
the film is a dream and , like a dream , is both fascinating and disturbing .
the opening scene in which a girl 's eye is sliced sets the tone of the film 's meandering and confusing itinerary .
many of the elements that make up the film are remnants of objective reality .
the way they are arranged within the scenario pushes them into a mental reconstruction process -- in exactly the way dreams draw on the previous day 's experience .
interestingly , the images have the matter - of - fact quality of a newsreel , or what higgenbotham calls a `` prosaic realism '' ( 38 ) .
__name1__ chose not to use the distorted lenses , supered images , or blurred focus ( cinematic conventions of the day ) to suggest the dreamlike quality of his film .
instead , he approached the entire non @-@ narrative in a straightforward manner .
he used the shocking incongruity of the images themselves to build the hallucinatory feeling of anguish that runs through the film .
the unrealistic fashion in which the realistic images were juxtaposed was the perfect way , according to __name1__ , to illustrate `` the dramatic collision between desire and the object of desire '' ( 10 ) .
obviously , the director drew much of __name1__ from his __name2__ heritage -- the religious and social implications , the themes of emotionalism and death , even the donkey carcasses .
`` thus __name1__ , as a milestone in the history of cinema , emerges from its director 's adolescence in __name2__ and announces the themes and techniques that were to preoccupy __name3__ for half a century , through the rest of his career '' ( higgenbotham 39 ) .
where desire and eroticism prevailed in __name1__ , religion took center stage in __name2__ ( __name4__ ) , produced in __name3__ in __year1__ .
__name1__ is a bizarre little narrative set in the __century1__ century a.d.
__name1__ , in order to be as close to __name2__ as possible , has stood praying on top of a __quant1__ - foot pillar for __quant2__ years .
he is profoundly sanctimonious - to the degree that he even blesses his own tooth when it falls from his mouth .
his devotion , however , is put to the test when the __name1__ ( a woman wearing the uniform of a __name2__ school girl ) arrives in a slithering coffin at the pillar .
she is intent on luring the holy disciple from his perch as she repeatedly ridicules him and insults his character .
simon heroically resists her temptations at every turn despite her various disguises ; first , a priest , then a shepherd , and finally as the __name1__ himself .
at last , despite simon 's holy strength , and for reasons not entirely clear , the __name1__ is able to exert her full power and whisk him away to hell -- a __name2__ disco where trendies writhe and grind to `` the radioactive flesh . ''
the implications are staggering .
`` the saint , devoted to his god , sits high on a pillar for all of life ....
but the pillar , discolored over the __quant1__ , winding and twisting its way to the ground , is the excrement of the saint .
saint though he is , his bowels must still move .
so there he sits , near __name1__ indeed , but supported on a pillar of excrement '' ( __name2__ 115 ) .
there have been several interpretations of this seemingly blasphemous imagery .
one is that __name1__ and his church are really built on unacknowledged humanity .
another is that we can reach __name1__ only through understanding the true nature of our humanity .
still another is that religion ( primarily __name1__ ) is essentially a `` pillar of excrement . ''
__name1__ himself put all the interpretations in perspective when he said , `` thank __name2__ i 'm still an atheist . ''
__name1__ 's flair for perverse surrealism and his malicious attacks on conventional morality were fully realized in his second __value1__ film , __name2__ ( __name3__ ) , produced in __name4__ in __year1__ -- almost __quant1__ years after __name5__ .
__name1__ in many ways functioned as a sort of sequel to his __year1__ film , __name2__ channe __name2__ ( __name3__ ) .
the images are astounding and playfully absurd :
__name2__ hostages of the __name1__ cry `` down with freedom ! '' as they are executed .
a __name1__ lieutenant fondles the statue of a beautiful noblewoman and is struck on the head by another statue .
bourgeois couples discuss defecation around a toilet - lined table but consider `` food '' an impolite topic , and so on .
the titular reference to a `` phantom '' boffows from the opening line of __name2__ 's __name1__ :
`` a specter is haunting __name2__ - the specter of __name1__ . ''
__name1__ twists this meaning to imply that the specter haunting the bourgeoisie is `` the possibility of its own freedom unburdened by the dead ends of sexual license , willful irrationality , and the liberty to go beyond the self - indulgent eccentricities of the individual ego '' ( __name2__ 318 ) .
__name1__ compared the film to one of his earlier surrealist works , l_age d ' or , saying , `` it is no longer possible to scandal @-@ ize people as we did in __year1__ .
today you have to do it with sweet subversion '' ( __name1__ 183 ) .
__name1__ charges that society has substituted arbitrary willfulness for freedom .
one of the film 's vignettes shows __quant1__ parents who insist on declaring their daughter a missing person , although she is plainly sitting in front of them .
the police , in a similar display of willful blindness to reality , even ask the child herself for her vital statistics and how she disappeared .
in another episode , __quant1__ chain - smoking monks gamble with their holy medallions in a card game .
`` i 'll open with a virgin , '' says one .
another plays a `` father . ''
__name1__ believed reality is actually a smoke screen for hidden urges .
he used the absurd to imply `` an attack on specific abuses , not on some safely vague condition of man '' ( __name1__ 65 ) .
in __name2__ __name1__ doubts not so much the possibility for society 's redemption as its likelihood .
`` we have been rendered unwittingly comfortable within our psychic cages to the point where we prefer them to liberty , an experience and aspiration we neither understand or desire '' ( __name1__ 331 ) .
for __quant1__ years , __name1__ made films about society 's dilemmas .
his art is his declaration of confidence in a human race dominated by a bourgeoisie given to hypocrisy , sadism , and above all , a disrespect for its own capacity to live differently and better .
he summed it all up himself :
as i drift toward my last sigh , i often imagine a final joke .
i convoke around my deathbed my friends who are confirmed atheists as i am .
then a priest , whom i have summoned , arrives ;
and to the horror of my friends , i make my confession , ask for absolution for my sins , and receive extreme unction .
after which i turn over on my side and expire .
but will i have the strength to joke at that moment ?
__name1__ died in __year1__ .
note : there 's a piece by __name2__ in __name1__ ( '' betrayed : the __name3__ who trusted __name4__ the most '' ) about all this , but it 's way too long to blog here .
check it out if you want .
it 's hair - raising stuff .
christ , can no one trust an __name1__ anymore ?
i 'm gettting sick and tired of being ashamed of the __name1__ .
what have we come to ?
fuck , piss , shit .
anyway , here 's a shorter piece from __name1__ :
thrown to the assassins
they cheered the __name1__ invasion ;
they offered to help , signed on as translators , risked everything they had to work for the __name1__ .
but when they had to run for their lives , __name1__ slammed the door .
by david case / __name1__
on the day the __name1__ tanks rolled into __name2__ , abather abdul hussein and his wife , balqes abdel mohammed , threw flowers .
literally .
after a lifetime of turmoil and tyranny , the couple fervently believed the invasion would bring peace .
abather joined __name1__ `` democratization '' efforts , such as a project to create a governing council for his neighborhood , and he occasionally ended up in the good - news __name2__ stories that still seemed plausible in those days ;
__quant1__ __name1__ paper ran a __quant2__ - column photo of him perched on a classroom chair surrounded by american soldiers , with a story about the `` new __name2__ . ''
these days , abather and his young family are among the hundreds of thousands of __name1__ who have fled in fear for their lives .
after months spent dodging insurgents who had targeted them for supporting the __name1__ , he and balqes are relieved to have escaped -- and bitter , like thousands of fellow refugees , that the superpower for which they risked their lives has abandoned them .
a short man who bundles his shattered body in layers against the desert 's winter chill , the __quant1__ - year - old abather is polite and relaxed , with an easy smile .
an engaging conversationalist even in broken __name1__ , he loves to talk about __name2__ , his infant daughter , and his wife , an outspoken woman several years his senior , whom he calls a genius .
`` when we met she was a professor at __name1__ , '' he boasts .
`` i was her student .
when she walked into a room , hundreds of people would stand to pay her respect . ''
considering that his life savings will run out in __quant1__ months , that he can n't work legally in __name1__ , and that he could be deported at any moment , abather is remarkably stoic , though the anxiety leaks out in tics .
he chain - smokes cheap __name1__ cigarettes , crushing the charred filters in an overflowing ashtray ;
when balqes complains , he sheepishly offers that `` smoking is my only work . ''
it 's not quite true --
his one other job during the past __quant1__ months has been recounting his nightmare , over and over again , to border guards , embassy workers , and aid agencies .
in __month1__ , he reluctantly told it to me , pulling documents from a worn leather folder to corroborate the details .
the story began after the ouster of __name1__ , when abather and balqes , like many __name2__ , launched a de @-@ baathification program of their own .
their target was the dean who had been balqes ' boss at __name2__ ( and who , as abather tells it , had forced her out when she resisted joining the __name1__ ) .
balqes wanted her job back ;
one day abather confronted the dean ,
and tempers flared .
__name1__ soldiers broke up the brawl , bound abather 's wrists with a zip tie , and interrogated him .
he explained balqes ' gripe and what the loss of her job had meant for their family , including their __quant1__ - year - old son and balqes ' __quant2__ - year - old son from a previous marriage ( her __value1__ husband had been killed in the __name1__ - __name1__ ) .
though he held a master 's degree in engineering , abather had n't been able to get a job in the doldrums of sanctions - era __name1__ ,
so he was scraping together a living repairing watches , his wife and children crammed into his father 's small home .
`` the soldiers were very understanding , '' abather recalls .
`` i was impressed . ''
they offered the family an apartment in a place called iraqi village , a compound near the __name1__ airport where __name2__ had housed orphans he was grooming to become __name3__ loyalists .
in return , the couple translated for the __name1__ , and eventually the __name2__ 's __quant2__ st battalion 303 rd armored regiment hired balqes as an interpreter , at $ __quant1__ per day .
abather ended up leading a __name1__ - contracted security squad with __quant2__ salary of $ __quant1__ .
learning that he was an engineer , soldiers later gave him lucrative reconstruction assignments .
in __quant3__ heady year , abather 's contracts would mushroom from a few __quant1__ dollars to an $ __quant2__ electrification project ( later canceled because he could n't procure the needed equipment ) .
abather and balqes glow with wonder when they speak of those days , of earning a good living and having their own home for the __value1__ time .
most of all , abather enjoyed hanging out with the __name1__ .
he seems to remember every soldier he ever met :
captain philips and sergeant buchard gave his children toys , a soccer ball , and school stationery ;
lieutenant glenn allen got so close to the family they called him `` uncle allen . ''
( allen confirmed abather 's story in emails to me , calling him and balqes `` very helpful individuals '' who `` risked their lives by meeting with us . '' )
it was as if they had suddenly found themselves citizens of the __value1__ st state .
and so , in __month1__ __year1__ , when abather got his __value1__ death threat , he thought it was a joke .
it was handwritten , tucked under the windshield wiper of his car inside iraqi village , a gated community with __name1__ checkpoints at both its entrances ;
the note read :
abather , leave your work with the __name1__ .
otherwise you will be killed by jihadis because you are a traitor .
__name1__
then the killings began .
lieutenant allen had once given abather a photo depicting __quant1__ __name1__ soldiers with __quant2__ of their __name2__ friends .
__quant1__ of the __name1__ were assassinated in short order .
abather began to notice cars following him ,
and a few times shots were fired at his car .
the anonymous notes grew increasingly menacing .
eventually , iraqi village felt so dangerous that abather and balqes moved the family back to his father 's house .
a death threat arrived there almost immediately .
still abather continued working with the __name1__ .
one day in __month1__ __year1__ , abather was driving balqes , __quant1__ months pregnant with their __value1__ child , to a doctor 's appointment .
at an intersection , he noticed a gold car parked by the road ;
suddenly the __quant1__ men in it leveled guns at him .
`` this is the end , '' abather thought ,
and then a __name1__ patrol appeared
and the assailants vanished into traffic .
within days , abather and balqes had sold off their belongings and fled to __name1__ .
their troubles had only just begun .
the u.s. embassy in __name1__ is an attractive , __name2__ - style fortress , heavily guarded machine - gunners in __name3__ pickups .
it sits high on a hillside ,
and the view is so phenomenal that you can imagine your gaze reaching all the way to the __name1__ border , some __quant1__ miles away .
in the foreground , __name1__ 's rolling mosaic of pale , boxy limestone buildings shimmers against the azure sky .
at its edges , in dank apartments on outlying hillsides , lives a substantial portion of __name1__ 's educated middle class .
almost all fled in a panic , after getting death threats or seeing loved ones murdered ;
many were targeted by insurgents or jihadis because they supported , or worked for , the __name1__ .
of __name2__ 's __quant1__ prewar population , about 1 in 8 -- some 3.4 million people -- have left their homes since the invasion , according to the __name1__ ( unhcr ) ,
and more than half of those have ended up abroad .
__name1__ labels this the world 's fastest - growing humanitarian crisis .
yet the __name1__ administration has refused to so much as acknowledge the refugees ' plight , let alone help them get to safety or even provide basic humanitarian aid .
in the past , notes bill frelick , refugee policy director at __name1__ , the __name2__ has often aided those persecuted for supporting it ;
since the __name4__ , __quant1__ __name1__ refugees have been resettled in the __name3__ , including tens of thousands of __name2__ army veterans .
but the __name1__ administration `` has abdicated that obligation , '' says frelick .
`` the people who have fled are the ones the administration was relying on to build democracy in __name1__ ;
it would rather ignore them than acknowledge that its initiative has failed . ''
it was in __name2__ that abather and balqes discovered the limitations of their friendship with the __name1__ .
lieutenant `` uncle '' allen had emailed the embassy in __name1__ to explain that the family feared for their lives ;
he 'd even offered to sponsor their relocation `` to the safety of the __name1__ . ''
an unsigned email from the embassy commended allen -- '' i know that your __name2__ friends appreciate your friendship '' -- but noted that __name1__ visas are `` quite difficult '' for __name2__ to get .
since __name3__ / __name3__ , __name1__ easterners in general , and __name2__ in particular , have faced enormous hurdles getting admitted to the __name4__ ;
until __year1__ , the __name1__ administration maintained a total freeze on __name2__ that shut out current refugees as well as hundreds of people who had fled __name3__ 's regime __quant1__ earlier .
the email nonetheless provided instructions on getting a tourist visa ,
and abather and balqes quickly filed their application along with the $ __quant1__ fee -- almost __quant2__ months ' rent .
several months later they were notified that they could visit the __name1__ for up to __quant1__ months , but that they could not bring their children .
they then made repeated visits to the __name1__ to apply for official refugee status .
as it has with almost __value1__ percent of the __name1__ who have come through its office in __name2__ , the agency turned them down .
abather and balqes set their sights on a visa to __name1__ , a major destination for __name2__ refugees , and even hired an iraqi lawyer there .
they waited for months .
their savings dwindled ;
then their baby fell ill ,
and the emergency surgery , for an intestinal obstruction , cost $ __quant1__ in cash .
in early __month1__ __year1__ , abather got a rejection letter from __name1__ .
around the same time , word came that his father had died of a heart attack .
so he went back to __name1__ to bury his father , help his mother find a place to live , and buy state - subsidized medicine for his daughter .
but when he returned to the __name1__ border less than __quant1__ week later , he was told he could n't reenter the country :
having recently suffered __quant1__ terrorist attacks , __name1__ had enacted a ban on entry for __name2__ men aged __quant2__ to __quant3__ .
for __quant1__ days abather stood on the highway at the border post , beseeching successive shifts of immigration officials .
finally , a guard promised to send the medicine to his family in __name1__ if he would just go away .
once again abather headed back to __name1__ .
driving in __name3__ a few days later , he noticed a __name1__ -- the __name2__ gangster 's vehicle of choice -- in his rearview mirror , closing in .
the car forced him off the road ;
armed men blindfolded him and knocked him unconscious .
when he woke up , he was in a tiny room , handcuffed to a chair .
masked men came and went , videotaping as they cursed him as a traitor .
they whipped him with a steel cable ;
__quant1__ months later , his back was still etched by deep , evenly spaced grooves .
`` we 've been searching for you for __quant1__ year , '' his captors told him .
abather recognized the voice of __quant1__ man , an acquaintance from iraqi village who had seemed to befriend the __name1__ .
`` i 'm sorry your father passed away , '' the man said .
soon , a bearded imam sentenced abather to decapitation for collaborating with the __name1__ .
abather barely heard the proceedings .
`` i was thinking the whole time about my little daughter in __name1__ . ''
he was told he could save himself by spying on the __name1__ , but he refused .
on the __value1__ day , the men asked if there was anything he wanted before he died ;
then they put him on the floor in the back of the __name1__ and sped off .
suddenly , abather heard gunshots .
the men shouted .
the car crashed ,
and everything went black .
he woke up in a hospital bed __quant1__ miles from __name1__ ;
__name1__ forces had attacked the __name2__ and pulled him from the burning wreck .
he had a compound fracture in his leg and severe burns all over his body ,
but the nurses urged him to leave :
his captors would be looking for him .
his brother -- who had received a ransom note from the kidnappers , complete with a photo of abather bound and gagged -- brought him back to __name1__ , where doctors fused a piece of plastic onto his shin and grafted skin from his thighs over his wounds .
a few weeks later , he was back at the __name1__ border ,
and this time the guards took pity .
the family had n't told balqes of the kidnapping .
but when she saw her disfigured husband , she says , `` i knew right away what happened . ''
on a crisp , clear day this past __month1__ , clutching a sheaf of papers documenting abather and balqes ' ordeal -- contracts , soldiers ' recommendations , death threats , a missing - person report -- i headed to __name1__ at the u.s. embassy in __name2__ .
abather and balqes had made several pilgrimages there ;
they were convinced that if only they could speak to an __name1__ , abather 's charred and mangled flesh would make their case , but they had never gotten past the __name2__ security guards .
outside the embassy , i joined a chatty , eclectic crowd of __name6__ : a retired hippie turned __name1__ teacher from __name2__ ; a woman with a __name3__ accent who struggled through the narrow eye - slit in her black veil to keep track of her hyperactive daughter ; a white - bearded man in a __name4__ hat , who said he was picking up his passport before returning to the __name5__ .
i wondered whether any of us would risk our lives for the __name1__ as abather and balqes had .
to get past the compound 's __value1__ wall , we navigated a metal detector , a body frisk , and an x @-@ ray machine ;
after crossing a __quant1__ - foot no man 's land we repeated the process at the __value1__ wall .
then we waited to be called .
the __name1__ admits more refugees than any country in the world ,
but in __year1__ , only __quant1__ __name1__ were allowed in ,
and most of them had fled persecution under __name1__ before the war .
this year , millions of __name1__ , __name2__ , __name3__ lankans , and __name4__ must compete for a mere __quant1__ refugee slots __name5__ has allocated for the __name6__ and __name7__ .
the __name1__ are in line behind their compatriots who have been waiting in __name2__ since the late __decade1__ s .
like other __name3__ representatives , __name1__ officials here refer displaced people to the __name2__ , which is charged with determining whether someone is a real refugee , and if so , with finding him a safe place to go .
except that , as __name4__ __name3__ head robert breen told me , a __year1__ agreement with __name1__ forbids the agency from classifying anyone as a refugee whom it can n't get out of the country within __quant1__ months -- an impossibility in the post / __name2__ world .
( a country of about 6 million , __name1__ has long had the world 's highest refugee population per capita , hosting more than a million __name2__ who fled __name3__ in __year1__ and were supposed to stay only a short time . )
of the __quant2__ __name2__ asylum seekers the office has registered since the __name1__ invasion , only __quant1__ have been granted refugee status ; meanwhile the line outside the __name3__ 's gates gets longer every week ,
and the wait for an interview stands at __quant1__ months .
to care for all of the region 's displaced __name1__ , the agency had a total budget of $ __quant1__ in __year1__ -- less than $ __quant2__ a person , which must cover not only the kafkaesque registration programs but also basic survival aid to refugees trapped in desert camps or squatting in abandoned buildings .
recognizing the potential for `` severe humanitarian suffering , '' the __name1__ in __month1__ recommended that `` the __name2__ take the lead '' in funding the __name4__ 's __name3__ program ;
currently it donates no more than a quarter of the budget .
direct __name1__ aid to the refugees consists of a tiny grant to the __name3__ relief organization __name2__ ( see `` how to help , '' page __value1__ ) .
at the embassy , i recounted abather and balqes ' ordeal at window 3 , then at window 1 -- the setup was similar to visitation in a high - security prison .
then , at window 4 , i told the story again to the consul general , who stood behind the bulletproof glass wearing a telephone headset .
i was expecting to hear that `` the __name1__ is doing its best to help , ''
but there was only silence as the consul 's eyes welled up .
( an __name1__ - based aid worker later told me that __name2__ diplomats are so distraught by the policies they are charged with representing that `` it just takes a few gin and tonics and they 'll break down . '' )
finally , the consul said , `` we hear stories like this all the time .
we have enormous empathy for the __name1__ who 've suffered after working with the __name2__ ,
but there 's really nothing the embassy can do for them . ''
she handed me a document outlining __name1__ ' sole concession to people like abather and balqes : visas for up to 50 military translators from __name2__ or __name3__ each year .
`` but do n't get their hopes up , '' she added quickly ;
there were thousands with the same story .
`` this is something __name1__ really needs to address , '' she said as we parted .
the administration certainly does n't seem inclined to take the initiative .
philip a. frayne , an embassy spokesman in __name1__ , told me that `` there are no reliable figures '' on how many people have fled __name2__ , and that in any case , it was __name3__ who drove out `` a large percentage '' of them .
likewise , in its __year1__ __quant1__ refugee report to __name3__ , the __name1__ focused mainly on those __name2__ - era exiles , and blithely intoned , `` it is hoped that significant numbers of __name4__ refugees will soon be able to return home , although the security situation will remain an important consideration . ''
the report ignored the fact that , according to a survey by the nonprofit __name3__ , __quant1__ new refugees entered __name1__ and __name2__ in __year1__ alone .
and __year1__ will likely be worse .
as much as a quarter of greater __name2__ 's population is now __name1__ ,
and the crowds have exacerbated the city 's severe water shortage .
prices have skyrocketed .
until recently __name1__ children could n't attend __name2__ schools ,
and their parents can not legally work ;
easily identified by their dialect , __name1__ are discriminated against and terrified of deportation .
some refugees never go outside .
__name2__ government spokesman __name1__ told me that his country , a staunch u.s. ally and aid recipient , `` certainly needs help , and has held discussions with __name3__ diplomats '' about this issue .
incidentally , __name1__ has also called upon the __name2__ to pitch in ;
__name1__ 's response so far has been to plan construction of a __quant1__ - mile wall along its border with __name2__ .
before i left __name2__ , abather invited me to visit his family and a physician friend from __name1__ who shares their __quant1__ - room basement apartment .
on the __name3__ channel from __name4__ , we watched __name1__ vehicles disappear behind roadside bomb blasts as a man sang , `` let 's go kill the __name2__ ! ''
the channel 's endless stream of anti @-@ __name1__ propaganda perplexed abather and his friends :
`` why does the __name1__ allow this ? '' they inquired .
when images of dead children supposedly killed by the __name2__ hit the screen , abather 's friend switched to a channel on which voluptuous __name1__ women danced in an un @-@ islamic way .
balqes served __name1__ coffee ,
and to keep the baby from playing with the colorful cups , abather suspended her from an elastic swing above our heads .
she giggled as he bounced her by her tiny foot .
this is her prison , he joked .
__quant1__ months after the kidnapping , he still had n't gotten the surgery he needed to heal his burned flesh ;
if the wounds become infected , he could die .
abather rarely complained .
__name1__ is testing us , he said .
but we will get through it .
he looked at the girl bouncing from the ceiling and smiled .
i have a daughter ,
and i 'm very happy .
balqes was more fearful -- twice in the past month , suspicious men had shown up at the apartment .
__name1__ , she worried , had already caught up with them .
how to help
very few organizations are working on getting aid to __name1__ refugees , and of those that are , many are too small or too beleaguered to accept individual donations ;
the __name2__ , for example , has suffered bombings and mass kidnappings , yet its volunteers continue to deliver aid to displaced families inside __name1__ .
one of the larger relief organizations working with the refugees is the __name2__ group __name1__ , whose caseworkers i shadowed while in __name3__ .
bucking the image of the __name1__ - driving aid worker , they made their rounds in an aging gray __name2__ , its roof eaten through by rust .
they visited __name1__ doctors , engineers , and executives desperate for food , heat , or blankets to fend off the desert winter ;
one family told the crew they had just sold their stove to buy food .
__name1__ helps a few thousand families __quant1__ year ,
but the demand far outstrips the money available to us , says magy mahrous , who oversees the project .
you can make a contribution at : __name4__ __name1__ 153 east 53 rd street , __value1__ th floor __name2__ , __name3__ 10043 account # 10100491 , aba # __value2__ , __name5__ code citius33

at first , i signed up for a blog on __name1__ , thinking that it was a site for it professionals where i could perhaps find friends more easily .
later , i signed up for another one on __name1__ , feeling that writing on msn might make it easier for me to communicate directly with my msn pals .
but gradually , i discovered that both sites were not very good .
at that time , __name1__ did not have the function of tallying traffic statistics ( i have the habit of looking at the statistics of everything ) ; and even though __name2__ had that function , others needed to sign on to msn before they could reply , this meant that after reading the entries , many could not reply even if they wanted to , hence largely reducing the interactive element .
the enthusiasm with writing the blog at the beginning was short - lived ; after writing a few original articles for promotion , i did not continue anymore .
at that time , i did n't think about posting articles from other sites as i felt that there was no need to post any articles if i could not come up with anything original ; this meant that sometimes for over __quant1__ months i did n't even update a new entry .
later , there were also some minor problems with both __name1__ and __name2__ , so i became more unwilling to post new articles .
so , these __quant1__ blogs have not really been very popular , either
one of the hypotheses states : a long time ago , in order to hide from wild beasts roaming on the land , humans had ever lived in shallow water regions for a long period of time , surviving on aquatic plants and fishes .
therefore , the body hairs , which increased the friction in water , had fallen off .
the reason for this explanation is that the fine hairs on the back of humans run from one side of the shoulder toward the spine , a different direction from that of monkeys .
only such a direction could reduce the friction in water , and provide more buoyancy for the person who is swimming in the water .
however , in all the primitive gathering settlements that have been discovered so far , we have not seen any settlement where people lived in such a way .
what is worse is -- from the perspective of the direction of the fine hairs as well -- the fine hairs on humans ' upper arm point downward , while the fine hairs on the lower arm point upward , which is to say , they all run toward the elbow .
this is somewhat similar to monkeys who have hairs : when it rains , they would hold their heads with their hands , and such a direction of their hairs would be easier for the rain to flow away along their elbows
what was __name1__ prosecuted for ?
earlier on , __name1__ 's involvement with the euro - for - oil transactions turned out to be a big news item with negligible after - effects , and finally it became a non @-@ issue , and hence there was no problem for iran and the __name2__ .
but this time , __name1__ came up with a ruble - for - oil proposal , and even began intensive preparations .
nobody would have any doubts about the technical capacity of __name1__ , not to mention its ability to protect its own resources and trade systems ,
the intimidation that __name2__ had inflicted on __name3__ is still remembered with a tinge of fear by some __name1__ brother - like countries .
the __name1__ is allowed to float freely now , but everyone still has sufficient reasons to doubt the replacement of the __name2__ dollar in dollar - for - oil .
but what was more vicious about comrade __name1__ was that he had rolled out what is known as a " barbarous " gold system ; and that is , before the wide acceptance of the ruble - for - oil , a portion of __name2__ 's __quant1__ oil revenues would be channeled toward increasing the country 's holdings of gold .
this is the __value1__ among all major countries to have issued such a clear proclamation - no wonder the recent link between gold and oil had almost been severed .
following the government 's announcement of new immigration regulations , all travelers arriving in __name1__ will receive the same treatment as they would receive when going to the __name2__ .
when they enter the country , they will be asked to provide biometric information .
at a press conference this afternoon , new immigration law confirmed by immigration minister __name1__ will give immigration officials the power to collect , store and use biometric information of non @-@ new zealand citizens .
these so - called non @-@ new zealand citizens include people with a tourist , temporary or residency visa .
these new regulations are very similar to procedures for entering the __name1__ .
the new immigration law also permits the immigration service to provide " limited " biometric information on __name1__ citizens to neighboring countries .
however , the law does not explain the reason .
__name1__ said , it has presently not been decided when or how the biometric information will be collected from people 's bodies .
the government has introduced legislation that will permit further collection of __name1__ samples from people 's bodies .
the new regulation on biometric information is only __quant1__ article among the __quant2__ articles that make up the new regulations .
__name1__ said the new regulations will effectively simplify border - entry procedures and protect citizens ' right and international human rights .
in __name2__ , a homicide occurred yesterday in an apartment where many __name1__ reside ,
a youth in his __quant1__ s was suspected to have been seriously attacked after he left a party ; he was found lying in one of the apartment units , and was pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital .
after the event , __quant1__ men were detained by the police to assist in the investigations , the motive of the murder remains unclear , and the case is now referred to the provincial integrated homicide investigation team for further investigations .
according to the spokesman for the provincial integrated homicide investigation team , dale carr , the crime scene was in an apartment unit on the 800 block of agnes street ( agnes st. ) in __name1__ .
the police received an emergency __value1__ call at 12 @:@ __time1__ a.m . yesterday , and rushed to the address mentioned above to investigate .
when the police arrived at the scene , they found an injured man lying in the unit ; he was seriously wounded , and certified dead upon arrival at the hospital .
the body was sent to the coroner for an autopsy in order to determine the cause of death .
for now , the police will not announce the name of the victim ; it will be decided upon only after the family is notified .
as to the cause of the victim 's death , and whether the case is linked to any illegal activities and others and etc. , the police declined comment .
carr also said that the police had applied for a search warrant from the court yesterday morning , and entered the unit in the afternoon with the warrant for a detailed investigation , in order to understand more about the incident .
investigators from the identification bureau also went to collect information from the scene later ,
as to the motive of the attack , and whether the police had found the weapon , the police have declined disclosure .
in the face of criticism and nitpicking , i believe that __name1__ is weaker than __name2__ .
why ?
because __name1__ was allowed to make mistakes , since he was a human being ; but __name2__ was not allowed to make mistakes , since he had been described as __name3__ .
__name1__ proposed evolution theory , but it was just a theory , and he himself also admitted that there were many questions ,
others may agree with him , or they may accept some parts while disagreeing with other parts , or in the future we might discover that the general direction of __name1__ 's evolution is largely correct though filled with a lot of errors , and that there might be an improved version of evolution which is more accurate and comprehensive than what darwin had proposed .
but as the originator , __name1__ deserves much credit .
jesus is god , and the __name1__ is the word of god .
__name1__ creates everything , understands everything , predicts the future , and is infinitely resourceful , so how can he be wrong !
therefore , if you find a sentence that is allegedly said by __name1__ , but effectively turns out to be wrong , then this god will be overthrown .
therefore , __name2__ is more vulnerable to criticism than __name1__ , because once an error is found , then he could not be the true god .
after the collapse of __name2__ 's dictatorial regime , __name1__ religious forces had entered a period of revitalization and expansion ,
although the distribution system of the new legislative power in __name1__ had generally taken care of the interests of all parties , and found a relatively reasonable balance point among all ethnic groups and sects -- otherwise a management committee , the interim constitution , and the current interim government would not have been successfully generated -- this does not mean that there were no contradictions among them .
from an internal point of view , __name1__ and __name2__ tend to see eye to eye on the political and economic benefits , and __name3__ politics had almost become the arena of these __quant1__ factions ,
although under the balance of interests some of sunni political figures were involved in politics , what the __name2__ radical groups were most concerned about was that the __name1__ would turn around and suppress them in the future .
in __month1__ of this year , a radical __name1__ organization attacked the __name2__ , which is the religious shrine of __name3__ , and this led to the eruption of the conflict between __name4__ 's __quant1__ largest parties .
the assassination of the __name1__ minister of industry has triggered off angry protests from supporters , plunging lebanon into yet another precarious situation .
in merely __quant1__ short years , this minister is the __value1__ senior official to be assassinated ; this shows that even after the forced withdrawal of __name2__ troops , long - suffering __name1__ still has n't ushered in the peace that it hoped for yet .
the __name1__ claimed that the __name2__ government was the murderer , but syria retorted by saying that the accusation was " totally without foundation , and in disregard of facts . "
at this moment , the real murderer is probably tittering , but the world has clearly seen that any one of the regimes of __name1__ and __name2__ is more fragile than the other .
the __name1__ media said that in the " post @-@ __name5__ " garbage era , countries like __name2__ , __name3__ , and __name4__ will encounter a lot more good shows or terrible tragedies .
and the people believed that .
it is uncertain whether the __name2__ prime minister had taken the political equivalent of __name1__ , or had lost his mind due to political biases , but he " lost his temper " several times in __name3__ during __name4__ , and almost messed up his meeting with president __name5__ .
fortunately president __name1__ was magnanimous enough not to take it to heart , and gave him the honor of a __quant1__ - minute meeting .
however , when this fellow returned to his own country , he boasted recklessly by saying that his meeting with president __name1__ had " important historical significance , " and even exaggerated by claiming it as his " major diplomatic achievement . "
but those __name1__ opponents already disgruntled with him , seeing through his tricks , could immediately tell that the meetings that president __name2__ had such as with __name3__ , __name4__ , and __name5__ all lasted over __quant1__ hour ; a mere __quant2__ - minute meeting with you -- excluding the pleasantries and translations -- was no different from an extended hand - shake .
this early morning the soccer match between the __name1__ women 's team and the __name2__ team had indeed made me excited , i was surprised by the match 's brilliance , and i also gained a new understanding of the korean team .
they attacked swiftly and fearlessly and coordinated with tacit understanding , but looking back at the __name1__ women 's soccer team , it was in an inferior position either in time - control or coordination .
we lost this game with no complaints .
but looking at the match between the __name2__ men 's soccer team and the iranians , that goal -- the insulting , provocative , and perverse goal -- made me question the quality of the __name1__ team and even of the people in that country .
the __name1__ team showed their guts during this game ; they manifested the courage and fighting spirit of chinese people .
we did not shy away from the powerful __name1__ team , but did our best ; it was n't until after an overtime and __quant1__ rounds of penalty kicks that we then regretfully lost the match .
let us remember the __name1__ team , remember this __name1__ player who scored this goal -- __name2__ .
the __name1__ warriors return to our motherland with hope .
i believe there will eventually be a day when we will -- avenge
[] a high school teacher teaching chemistry in the __name1__ has appealed to the __name2__ to allow the views and theories that __name3__ created everything and intellectual life created the world to be introduced into school to be taught to students together along with __name4__ 's theory of evolution , which has been dominating the scientific community since the __century1__ th century , and let students judge between right and wrong for themselves .

after the successful implementation of a " soft landing " , the rumbling train of __name1__ 's economy is running forward smoothly at high speed .
" proper , quick and stable " growth will become the main theme of this year 's economic development .
official authorities revealed that this year the __name1__ government determined that the economic growth rate was __value1__ % and price levels will be controlled within __value2__ % .
this means that the whole economic operation situation will maintain a healthy pattern of " high growth and low inflation " .
people in economic circles seem to be more optimistic about the economic outlook .
the growth rate , predicted by concerned experts of the __name1__ , the __name2__ and the __name3__ , is mostly 1 to 2 percentage points higher than governmental plans .
of course , to a relatively large extent , this depends on aggregate control of using monetary policy as a primary means , or in other words , under the major premises of general tightening , how financial control should timely and reasonably conduct fine tuning .
moreover , the impact of __name1__ 's financial crisis should not be underestimated .
on the part of the government , the keynote of a moderately tight macro @-@ economic policy will not be changed .
the key of the current economy is not striving for a higher growth rate , but is adjusting structures and increasing benefits so as to make macro controls which were implemented from the __value1__ half year of __year1__ obtain greater achievements and push the national economy onto a road of constant , rapid and healthy development .
actually , as main obstacles that restrained economic growth in the past several years -- inflation and the " bottleneck " of basic industries have all been evidently relieved and the macro @-@ economic situation tends to loosen , __name1__ 's economic development is in a relatively favorable period .
this year , __name1__ plans to create an effective pulling force to economic growth through maintaining a moderate and stable growth of investment , consumption and exports .
fixed assets investments will grow by __value1__ % this year , total volumes of retail sales of social consumer products by __value2__ % and export growth by __value3__ % .
at the same time , the financial deficit will be reduced by __quant1__ yuan .
after bidding farewell to the age of " the shortage economy " , relations between commodity 's supply and demand have changed from a " buyers ' market " to an integrated " sellers ' market " and competition will be intensified .
hence , activating the consumer market , especially the wide rural market , cultivating consumer hotspots and new economic growth points appear to be particularly urgent .
along with comprehensively implementing hardship relief measures taken towards large and medium - sized state owned enterprises , the pace of state owned enterprise reforms will be accelerated greatly , the dynamics of bankruptcies , mergers and assets restructuring will be strengthened , and enterprise deficits are estimated to decrease by __value1__ % and a number of competitive large and medium - sized state owned enterprises will gradually form .
however , the large amount of worker layoffs that will accompany this will cause unemployment pressure to gradually increase .
__name1__ has determined to appropriately place laid - off workers and to strive to control the unemployment rate to within __value1__ % through implementation of a large scale " re @-@ employment " project .
according to estimates , after __quant1__ years in a row of bumper harvests , if this year 's measures are effective , agriculture still has hope of achieving a good harvest .
agriculture 's increasing production and peasants ' increasing revenues will create favorable conditions for inhibiting commodity prices and realizing the target of steady economic development .
currently , the degree of dependence on the outside of __name1__ 's economy has reached __value1__ % , and the space of utilizing overseas markets and resources is in the process of expanding , but is more easily subject to the influences of the international environment .
under the circumstances of a relative steady domestic demand , the pulling effect of the trend of foreign trade towards economic development is more striking .
taking all factors as a whole , this year 's amount of foreign trade will be increased steadily , the import will be increased and the increasing speed of the export will be somewhat slowed down .
people in economic circles said that __name1__ should adopt positive and steady measures to solve outstanding problems in economic operations , and special attention should be given to clear up bad assets in time and strengthen financial risk prevention .
forecasting the year of the tiger , although __name1__ 's economic train will have ups and downs , as long as adjusted and controlled measures are at the right time and appropriate , it is believed that the train will move steadily along the preset track .

he estimated that the rate of economic growth in __name1__ would be about __value1__ percent .
nakamura said that the __name1__ economy exhibited negative growth in the year ' 97 , and that in ' 98 , if it did n't adopt good economic policies , the economy would continue to be in negative growth .
he estimated it would be negative __value1__ percent , plus or minus .

but because __name2__ 's usual income and expenditures show a favorable balance , and in addition it has over __quant1__ __name3__ dollars in foreign exchange reserves , it is n't likely to sink into the crisis like the other __name1__ nations .

__name1__ said that in the beginning of __month1__ of this year , the __name2__ would hold the __name3__ in __name4__ with the theme of " population , continuous economic growth and continuous development " .
this shows that the international community has increasingly recognized that population and development are inseparable , and prepare to adopt actions together .
he feels that this congress has important meaning , and the __name1__ government has given it high level attention and will be sending a delegation to attend the congress .
__name1__ said __name2__ was the most populous developing country in the world .
the __name1__ government included the population problem into the overall planning of the national economy and its social development , always emphasizing that population growth and economic development need to fit together , and be coordinated with resource utilization and environmental protection .
in light of china 's basic national condition , the __name1__ government has determined planned parenthood and environmental protection as __quant1__ basic national policies , implementing a population policy and planned parenthood program that suits china 's actual needs .
at the same time , the __name1__ government also formulated a series of important policies and measures to realize continuous development , such as the protection of women 's legal rights and benefits , the promotion of equality among men and women , the forceful development of healthcare for women and children , the zealous elimination of poverty , and protecting the environment .
presently , the __name1__ economy is continuously growing , society is stable and united , people 's livelihood are continuously improving , and the population birth rate and the natural population growth rate has dropped to a lower level .
__name1__ said the population problem was one of the major problems currently faced by the international community .
due to differences in country 's situations , differences in economic development levels , cultural backgrounds , historical traditions , and social systems , each country should formulate suitable , effective population policies according to the actual situation of the native country .
this is the sovereignty of each country and it should receive full respect .
he said __name1__ was in a critical period of building up a __name2__ market economy system and increasing the pace of its modernization build - up , but a huge , overwhelming growth in population was still restraining the social and economic development , affecting the further improvement of the living standard of the people , and has also brought about heavy pressure on the natural resources and the natural environment .
because of this , for a fairly long period of time , at the same time as forcefully developing the economy , __name1__ will continue to pay close attention to doing well the work of family planning .
the __name1__ government strongly believes that , the resolution of china 's population problem is not just being responsible for the prosperity of the chinese race and the happiness of future generations , but is also an important contribution in stabilizing the world 's population .
for this , the __name1__ government views with extreme importance and actively participates in international population activities , and sincerely hopes that the international community will adopt a stand of realistic resolution of population and development problems , seeking similarities while accommodating differences , co @-@ operating closely to strive hard together towards a stable world population to create a beautiful future !
