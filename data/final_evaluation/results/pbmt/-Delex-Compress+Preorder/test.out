it would not take long . 
in late 2004 , opening run around the circumference of the southwest quadrant of richmond to new urban region highway route to 288 name 
already it change development patterns due to worsening pattern and caused localized congestion around its exit from the traffic . 
as for the richmond times - dispatch newspaper today told a tale about the impact of the huguenot to trail in powhatan county 
by will jones reported traffic more than doubled in one section of trail huguenot to name roads , since the opening of the road named 288 
as a surge of speed and the accident . 
so far this year reported 17 near to winterfield road intersects the road accidents , up from 12 accidents in all of 2004 . 
by the virginia department of transportation for residents of engineer dale totten , notes that if the government had more money and cost about $ 4 of its lane of the road . 
vdot , of course , has no money for road construction in the richmond region . 
vdot by government spent 288 named frigging roads all their money , local politicians and people because of a boost 
what you need is people to homer simpson 
this is a major moment . doh ! 
288 of routes we predicted road name generated residential development in the area of scarcely populated all around to overtax road exit of the local country roads . 
other people choose where to work and where people live by the limited access highway traffic relief drivers back and forth in chesterfield county between goochland county but 
and creating traffic congestion in the new place . 
i am surprised how rapidly this would only 
even i think the lag may be three years or four years . 
do you think religious created for all religious exit liable in 288 name road routes already created cost $ 13000000 road construction in just one exit this ! 
another predictions 
soaring need for new and improved roads , after more than a year . a few scattered development and subdivision approved mega commercial project at the intersection of roads named 288 major road . 
well , we can see no zoom fund liabilities to well past $ highway originally built to take the original 400 million in before the end of the decade . 
brainiac , i think , is the name of the road routes , 288 such a great idea . 
thanks for nothing . 
i think that could be better spent elsewhere . for 400 million dollars . 
i think you blame 288 of creating that you should not 
what if there are enough of them . they have created a new traffic congestion at the alternative in the new place . 
additional traffic congestion to the old place ? 
now you understand people like tmt in fairfax city feel things . 
i usually take my position in favor of the road . 
the name is definitely 288 road excess with a glaring need in other parts of the state but 
the city of richmond has virtually no have traffic . 
rush hour will last 30 minutes . 
and you give them a beltway through largely rural areas . 
the road to nowhere . 
just think ! could spend another where cross the potomac river or desperately need in nova region improve roads this money . 
i said the rest of the rest of the state to help pay for the name 288 roads last year while dealing with the budget , adding insult to injury wiped out to pay the debt on the virginia centrist people 
very nice of you to oblige . 
in a sense , but not much . 
it was the same old problem . 
if you get ahead , you need an accusation so sprawling 
if built in places where there is already an acute need not claim you could pave your way out of congestion 
an anonymous person called 
that is a fair point . 
at 5:26 makes a good point . 
this situation hammered the validity of what his state audit report found that of the funds based on a comprehensive transportation plan for the state based on best lobbying by ctb and vdot government funding for transportation projects , but at home . 
i submit that this is a situation that should not be tolerated in disgrace . 
and senator chichester and his toady poured more money into this flawed institutions so this is worse . 
what is the purpose of what transportation expenses . 
in virginia , the purpose of it to benefit the private business plan and it will not serve the interest of the public . 
to all of you are dead wrong . 
no less walter stoch stated intention to pay money for economic development for the road name , 288 
come on , folks . 
i do not understand their point to tmt person 
the last time when you are not in some sort of business or from business you are stuck in traffic . 
it seems to me that the whole point of the road will facilitate the public interest for the public to get private businesses and the public get from business . 
need overwhelming support of business , of course , but driving in a soccer game on sunday and a trip to grandmother location . 
no wonder we suffer the congestion problem does not match what we expenditure on the road for business or increase state domestic products 
if we recognize that the primary road business benefits , we should do two things . 
paid by business , of course , what business we passed more us transportation bill ! and incentives for businesses to locate a business is the least stressed that even if the system is to locate more overall travel means business ! 
so it is hard to understand why 
a solution to a functioning human settlement patterns and balanced transportation capacity of the system for land use will generate demand for travel . 
in all else . 
emr 
in the tmt said that in virginia , it was the purpose of the benefit plans to private businesses and it will not serve the interest of the public . 
i do not see this statement appeared to point to things , demonizing private business plans and putting the public interest because above all else . 
i think they are intertwined , they are virtually the same as tight 
obviously , the local problem is this lumpy , cookies , so the dough 
if we long enough to demonize business . eventually , we found that we all work for the devil . but in aggregate 
i see no point in claiming a balanced solution with ever changing dynamic nature . 
even see rail to dulles airport to airport is positive job centers to promote bidirectional because demand for rail . 
i agree . 
in fact , that is reason to build it all on its own may be sufficient . 
all i said to apply exactly the same logic should road . 
they have both end destination should be the maximum we will use what we invest 
we need more places to get closer to saying we need to balance . 
a reality check here . 
every morning and evening drive through called watkins to landing facility the past . 
i commuted back and forth to where i work through huguenot name road to the trail . 
i have never seen anything remotely like a flood of traffic . 
it zone 55 mile-per-hour speed-quantity where every 75 to 100 and how long the morning car . 
already plans to widen to huguenot trail road , named by funneling through robious road , before the whole bunch zone years ago existing development by development in chesterfield county side heavy demand and new school 
instead of a lack of road by a bottleneck in powhatan county , and west of chesterfield county , a wonderful 288 of those of us who actually use the road . 
we can for commercial development and we can work closer to where we live . 
you might think that using land is irrational . 
i do not desire to live in any city . 
i refuse to work in the downtown area . 
i refuse to use mass transit , no female safe commuting long hours at work . without regular work . 
and i happen to like the development of a large lot . 
i do not understand exactly how i keep horses on the 14 - acre lot , i suppose . 
can go on a gallon of gas for $ 10 . 
and i still pay for living in the country . 
many legitimate prefer certain types of small business gardens hunting horses and make people do not want to live in the urban core . 
i live in a city , this infatuation with truly baffled . 
if they wish to live , they have every right to live in the country as an anonymous person 6:37 
you have no rights to the rest of the state underwrite the cost of the construction of a 400 million dollar highway for easier to shop , but get to work . 
consistently overlooked else can be spent 400 million dollars in the debate on what to name the road , 288 
if the money is applied to other press road projects or , god forbid , even without the road project can alleviate much traffic congestion to

that self harm is addictive . you can overcome that , but harmed . 
remember that self harm is not define you . 
you can overcome it . 
i found that in the past year . as always , every time i went out to check , especially university what belongs to me . i make sure i have not lost anything . nor have i left anything on so i think i got a form of ocd 
i twice every one go , i often had to check and after 30 seconds . for some reason not to , then i can resist , i checked again . 
why this 
i craze or something ? 
:snt1 it most often when it carried it , but rarely carry many and many times . still , even on a daily basis . this is the check ocd any extent disease ? 
what could i have done this . 
if not checked , i am getting sort of go away . after 15 to 30 minutes time , very anxious for that much , so i could not wait that long , but often anxiety . 
i would feel if i lost my wallet , my phone or my doom or doom i feel 
i just wish i could not once every 2 minutes left to worry about something or i lost something going out . 
i really do not know what to do , and i was afraid that i went to a gp 
they probably never heard some compulsion . like this , and i just dont know what to do . 
any of you have a ritual - like ? 
people think i was crazy to get out of this difficult but very strange . 
my advice ? you can . 
i used to do this my way into college have :snt2 list on me . i know i have the items i use my compulsive multi-sentence checked at the bus . 
so you just tried on relatively fresh weaned on habits , habits and also tell you that you do not keep checking these things but you definitely visit your doctor . i have more severe anxiety now , and i think this is a warning sign . i know that is easier said than do 
he is seen as much more a bad case that is not because you worry ? 
i do about :p ocd when psychology class today . 
you just avoid compulsive act maybe the way you get rid of it , because you have not checked your losing something and just leave it . 
gradually decrease it to overtime , hopefully you disappear ocd , but increase your anxiety level for duration 
for just that sounds rather have really bad ocd are overly anxious 
as i was 20 times a night . every time i got up to check all particularly lock to lock in my house , i am very obsessed 
sometimes , i am convinced that they are not a lock , but i know they lock 
i think it will become a real problem started really obsessed interrupted your daily routine . 
your definitely not crazy for you not to worry , and i am sure that your gp understand the issue . 
i went to therapy for others also reason and i encourage them . i cut down i pick the numbers obviously less than 20 times to check and i stick to the numbers . 
i think the idea that i was taught if i checked five times or 20 times . i still check is ok . 
i have a lot more good so far and i think i definitely hope to improve anyone who wants to improve . 
too much of me not to worry , i was usually pretty calm about things and i would like to take it as it comes , 
but i find i became really anxious about things in the past one month , two months , i am not talking mere feel nervous from the blue . 
i am beginning to feel me beforehand . i am not too much worried about a variety of things not even crossing my mind as something to ring alarm bells in my head to irrational panic . 
i am not sure that a lifestyle change to go for care - free student to graduate and unemployed people to sign this or these other issues ? i began this bug affected by this , and i am confident , but i was happy . 
i spoke with a few of my parents . with all the same people think i go to random phase me until it is clear that serious problems i held off , but i should act . 
so wondered what was the best thing to do . 
you speak it to the doctor and you saw against anxiety pills ? can take off the edges of things . 
i see that i can speak to the people who counsel ? 
or do i take what the closest people around me advice and became an anxiety problem . just keep an eye on anxiety ? 
well not start trying to keep an eye on your anxiety as the eye makes me tense and more likely to panic , the more you should circle demise there 
try when you start to feel a bit as-soon-as anything you panic , you focus on something guaranteed to make you smile or feel better i should be happy . 
if you cannot do that or you get to your friends makes you laugh when you start to feel panic :snt2 lol . i work on it , and i suffered from panic attacks and random multi-sentence 
starting just started my tiny things than you really worried but not severe from the sound of things . 
i found that just talking about what makes you anxious to help someone else . 
i find it makes me feel better about what i know , no big deal . and i need not be anxious about things i mentioned what i worried about my mum and i see people react to that situation i should i react calm not moaning , but perhaps a way . 
it was worse if you go to the doctor . but 
i have a friend who suffered severe anxiety may prevent people to leave the house and do the things that people are so worried that things could go so wrong . 
doctors give the medication and they make good her much more .

from the plans they are training to repel possible invasion and imperialist superpower of as many as 2 million civilians from venezuelan president hugo chavez , dealing with russian weapons and curb people worry that its military cooperation with the united states , domestic critics of chavez and a former military officer leftists plan things . 
chavez insists that the moves are purely defensive and overdue need to update obsolete military hardware and protect venezuelan national may want the nation to move birth control . 
venezuela is the state most petroleum production in the south american continent . 
by domestic opposition to chavez . they scoff at the idea that the us would ever invade venezuela , and charge that the true intention is to arm a huge cadres of loyal reservist protected with any internal rise up and posing as a counterweight to the influence of militarization in latin america . 
major ally fidel castro led cuba with chavez and growing closer to people . 
they detract from chavez . the us government said that even more may be part of the strategy in a cuban - style socialist image restructuring militarization of venezuelan democracy through foment leftist revolutions throughout south america with his arms purchases and indoctrination of civilian militias trouble . 
as the us military strategist said from the radical movements of people inspired by chavez could foment such revolution , increasing concern . 
the shift in the political mainstream in latin america as a leftward since late 1990 . 
largely a reaction to the perceived failure of free market economics , this shift leftward 
a leftist elected to lead brazil , argentina , chile uruguay :op5 countries ecuador , venezuela and 
supporters of chavez at home against the united states has a centuries - long history of openly armed intervention of latin american domestic politics and its covert armed intervention in politics and said it had no right to question venezuela prepared for defense . 
as for carlos roque espinoza leon said the venezuelan people never asked us marines do . 
defense specialist pro - chavez called that espinoza to leon of the venezuelan national assembly , has been in service . 
by espinoza said peru has 500,000 rifles and no one says anything . 
by espinoza said no one complained that colombia is in the latin american country most militarization 
by espinoza said full us history of aggression in latin america . 
by espinoza said that the venezuelan people will do the necessary to protect the country . whatever . 
chavez famously said was so called venezuela called bolivarian revolution is peaceful , but armed 
in 1998 the first election of chavez and of the datanalisis polling firm , independent 71 percent rated his popularity 
in venezuela , a country of alberto garrido , the military analyst , said chavez is looking for allies in russia , china and iran to promote multiple polar world to counteract us dominance will encourage grassroots movements in latin america to move threw the government influence . 
lorenzo campos of the name as a farmer in anzoategui state in northern venezuela and reservist training people . 
by campos said that venezuela wants the world to know that he is not preparing to attack anyone , and the purpose of the mission was to protect the country . 
of the chavez government , announced in may 2005 . details of its deal with a russian firm to purchase 100,000 each with ak assault rifle with 30 rounds of ammunition from 18600000 dollars and technology transfer for venezuela to manufacture the rifles 
the deal works out to $ 186.22 per one rifle 
considerably less cost than this price is the price the same order on the us mail weapons within $ 825 and $ 850 
the government of venezuela also intends to buy in six naval craft from 10 russian helicopters and 10 transport planes from spain . 
by venezuelan officials said the government was negotiating with brazil to buy around 24 planes for air support and training planes . 
with chavez insisting and most staunch even retired military critics here agree that the purchases are essential to update old weaponry from its decades old fal rifles called from belgium 
as with retired general fernando ochoa antich said in exaggerated , saying chavez engaging in arms build - up 
ochoa called in by then lieutenant colonel chavez launched a failed coup defence minister in 1992 , had 
by ochoa stated that venezuela does not purchase arms during the past 25 years and said chavez has no aggressive buying weapons to threaten his neighbors 
by ochoa said venezuela has never bought russian arms before and suggested that chavez to buy arms for their becoming independent of the us . 
by ochoa asked why chavez to buy popular force subversion in latin america caliber rifle and stated that political support radical leftist move to make the menace of the continent . 
the us pentagon open questions that chavez will do with the old fal rifles and might share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in latin america ? 
as the us government provided no evidence that chavez or armed leftist insurgency funding the insurgency . 
by military analyst with colombian farc guerrillas have of the military they specialize in , and they say the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking and are not interested in old rifles from belgium or chavez assistance 
by the us defense intelligence agency study published in 2003 reported that originated more than half from 1998 to 2001 , seized from colombian guerrillas and weapons , including a mark of foreign military weapons to venezuela . 
implying that corrupt venezuelan military members of military members sympathetic or aiding the guerrillas . 
more could you mind ideological critics say training for the military and for new civilian reservist distressed domestic opposition to the chavez people . 
for chavez to call the so called revolution unit started a unit preparing the public for the public to resist a superpower aggressor earlier 2005 and said that the first step to a resistance unit in the coming year , he is back training with the active duty armed forces of people between 100,000 to 2 million volunteers 
military analysts estimate the number of venezuelan 83000 of active duty armed forces . 
creating his defense units in under chavez called the establishment of the free university and state of the neighborhood , and the unit reported directly to the president . 
the government insists that the reserves will support the armed forces reserves and not act as a fifth column against a possible coup against chavez . 
by espinoza said that the reserves were not used as shock troops for any political party should civil war each side decide things . 
general julio ramon quintero viloria in as to reserve for commanders . 
by quintero said armed forces hope in the second half of 2005 over the weekend were forced to train 50,000 civilians and in 2006 force training more 300,000 civilians in a may interview . 
by quintero said the venezuelan people do not want the colony of any empire , and to be ready for any possible must 
to engage 100,000 reservist and venezuelan navy massive war games in june 2005 game repel stronger in invaded countries . 
of the 40 state oil company employed with 1,200 soldiers to participate in a similar exercise in june 2005 . 
the circle of pro - chavez here warned not symmetrical warfare . 
warfare is not symmetrical by us military strategist of the term coined to describe that unequal combatants conflict where weaker side employing guerrilla tactics 
as the us government has given 3.3 billion dollars , most of it military aid to colombia in the past five years . 
for loyal to chavez fears that the us government could have instigated colombia proxy war against venezuela , to oust the government and control the oil from the country . 
the us senior official dismissed the notion that the government of the united states government wants to invade venezuela not to utter a complete sense of a notion in an interview with the official . 
the official said that chavez side wishes to make the relationship negative side by side political calculations that mr. chavez by constantly confronts us reach power 
in another development in chavez roll-back military cooperation and joint exercises with the troubles in the united states . 
the us military had cooperation office in a venezuelan fort for 50 years . 
chavez . it shut down in 2004 . 
the order of five us military people participating in exchange program students participating , and left the country in april 2005 . 
analysts said it is likely that chavez tried indoctrinated their public and their armed forces .
