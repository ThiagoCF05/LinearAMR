thanks for reading . 
you ? or on any drugs getting any drug therapy . 
should you talk or your school nurse your gp told or what was going on . 
can you trust the people you can tell schools to teach 
can you help if you tell people . 
it is likely only to worsen if you keep it inside bottle-up 
trust me , good to get these things early as possible instead of letting things will get worse and even more . 
neither did please ! this . 
but at age 17 to start self harm means cutting my arms last year , mainly to stop harm during the past few months . 
it is hard , but you can do it . 
but i felt more happy so much remind scar , i see what i felt at that time , to feel so strong , so i want to do such a thing to me , to my pain . 
and also , strength , you can do it i find salvation and keep writing poetry journal 
addictive but self harm , you can overcome any harm 
remember , not define self harm to be you . 
you can overcome it . 
so i find i have to check my belongings . i always make sure no lost or anything , i have not left anything . every time i go out , especially at the university this past year . i think i got the disease , so the form of ocd 
i have to checked twice to go . often i could not resist . i check again after 30 seconds . then , for some reason . 
why is this . 
craze ? or something to me . 
and it most often when it is carried by many things , but it does carry rarely check it many times a day even disease still ocd ? this is any extent . 
what i do is how this could have happened . 
but i am getting very anxious sort of went away after 15 30 minutes if i did not check with much anxiety cannot wait that long , often 
i feel or doomed if i lose my wallet nor my phone . i felt doomed ? 
i wish i could go out . i am not worried about leaving or something . i had lost something every two minutes just 
and i do not know what i really do fear i went to a gp 
and they have not heard some compulsion like this probably ever . i dont know what i just did . 
? you like any ritual 
however , people thought i was crazy , it was difficult to get out of this very strange . 
the advice . what can i 
i use to do this my way to college , and a list of the items i had on me . i know i used to check my compulsive in the bus . 
multi-sentence know more easily said than done . i have severe anxiety more now , i think this is a warning sign , so you try and weaned on habits , habits are relatively fresh , just visit your doctor , but definitely keep telling yourself that you did not check these things also 
doctors are seeing cases much worse not to worry about that . 
i do about ocd :p :subevent psychology class today . 
a possible way to get rid of it is to avoid acting just so compulsive checks and not lose something when you leave it just 
it will decrease gradually disappearing because ocd hopefully your overtime , despite the anxiety level increases your duration 
that sounds overly anxious , are you , rather than you have ocd really badly , just for me . 
i was very obsessed . i got up to 20 times a night to check her house lock locked all my particular 
i am convinced that they are not locked in , but i know sometimes they lock 
i think it will become a real problem that interrupted the start of your routine obsessed daily really 
because you are not crazy , definitely not worry you ? sure i understand your gp issue . 
i went to therapy for other reasons , they have also encouraged and i pick the numbers obviously less than 20 times to check my stick . i cut down the numbers 
i think the idea that i was taught . i am still ok if i checked five times to check my 20 times . 
good and a lot more for me so far . i think there is hope for anyone who wants to improve will definitely improve . 
calm and pretty what i usually like to take things as it comes to things i would not worry too much . 
however , i find i become really anxious about things over the past one month or two months , i am not talking about mere feels nervous from the blue . 
i began to panic . i felt a variety of things . i would not worry too much , as does not cross my mind as something so alarming bells ringing in my head . i even irrational . 
but i am not sure whether or lifestyle change means going from students for free care for unemployed graduates this this will signal the beginning of other issues this bugs me because this is going to effect my confidence and i was happy . 
but it does speak to a few people , including my parents , the people all think i go and random phase i should act held off until it is clear the serious problem . the same with me . 
wonder what is best to do so , who is the 
speaking about it . you see doctors who took the pill against anxiety about possible edge . from what ? 
see ? i spoke with counseling can 
or , should i take advice from people around me to close my eyes until anxiety , the anxiety became just the problem . 
should not start trying to keep an eye on your anxiety eye makes me tense and likely more panic well more circles , its demise there . 
i should try to focus on something that is guaranteed to make you smile or feel more happy with you as soon as you start to feel panic a bit of anything . 
or , you got to make them your friend , you laugh when you start to feel that you will panic if they cannot do that . and it worked for me . i suffered panic attacks , random lol . 
start start tiny worries really severe , although you are not just from the sound . 
i find that talking helps make you anxious just to someone else . 
but i found that i mentioned my worries to my mum and i see people react to the situation as calm as i should react to me . that makes me feel better . the reason i know the deal and no big thing . i had no need to be anxious about the way things are perhaps not moan 
however , go to the doctor if it was worse . 
i have suffered severe anxiety , to prevent and to leave the house to do what is possible to worry about what has gone wrong so my friend . 
doctors gave her medication made good on her medications , much more .

worry about the deal , and hugo chavez of venezuela , the president of russia to curb weapons cooperation with us military plans to train with the australian repel an invasion by imperialist superpower could be as many as 2 million civilians in the united states , critics of chavez domestic plan has a leftist former military officer . 
insisting chavez purely defensive and movement was born out of the need to update obsolete military hardware to protect venezuelan nationals wanting to control the region may move overdue 
petroleum - producing states as south america is venezuela . 
scoff and opponents of chavez which domestic ideas about the us invaded venezuelan ever charged intended his arms and cadres of loyal reservist huge rise up to protect the people from any internal posing as a counterweight to the influence of militarization in latin america true . 
and ally fidel castro led cuba with growing major chavez to close more . 
according to detract from chavez in us government trouble as part of a strategic restructuring of democracy in venezuela , with the image of the socialist - style country , militarization of cuba , to foment leftist revolutions throughout south america and arms purchase indoctrination of civilian militias could be even more . 
according to the us military strategist foment concern by radical movements inspired by chavez that such a revolution could increase 
the shift of the political mainstream in latin america leftward since late 1990 . 
reaction to failure to free market economics . the perceived leftward shift in this largely 
leftists elected to lead brazil , argentina , chile as uruguay countries ecuador , venezuela 
and supporters counter that chavez at home to have history of united states intervention in domestic politics of latin america open armed political intervention covert arms as long as a century , said he has no right to question to prepare venezuela for defense . 
according to carlos roque espinoza leon , to ask not what venezuela did the us marines ever . 
the name is leon espinoza to pro - chavez national assembly of venezuela on defense specialist services . 
according to espinoza has 500,000 rifles peru that no one said anything . 
according to espinoza , no one complains of militarization in latin america . colombia is 
according to espinoza history full of us aggression in latin america . 
according to espinoza , must be done to venezuela . whatever is necessary to protect its people . 
he said chavez was peaceful but called the bolivarian revolution venezuelan arms so called famously event . 
elected chavez in 1998 . in the first poll ratings firm datanalisis independent with 71 percent of their popularity

working out a deal with 186.22 per rifle , $ 1 
the cost of these prices considerably less than between $ 825 to $ 850 for the same weapon prices on mail order from the us . 
the government intends to venezuela to buy 10 and helicopters from russia and transport planes , 10 from six spanish naval craft was also from north korea . 
according to venezuelan officials , the government is negotiating with brazil to buy planes and support planes for training . the air around 24 
they insist chavez critics agree that retired military people even the most staunch here purchases are essential to update old weaponry , such as the old fal rifles decades from belgium of the military . 
according to fernando ochoa antich in general has exaggerated retirement of engaging said chavez to build up its arms . 
for ochoa as defense minister , launched in 1992 by chavez , then lieutenant colonel of the failed coup . 
and by ochoa did not purchase the venezuelan arms during the past 25 years , said people are not buying the weapons chavez aggressively by threatening his neighbors 
according to ochoa did not buy venezuelan arms from russia had ever before suggested he buy armed chavez to become independent from us . 
asked by ochoa why people buy chavez caliber rifle popular force subversion in latin america to make a statement that they support the move , the radical left political menace to the continent . 
questions from the pentagon and the us is what people do with rifles , chavez called the old fal whether to share weapons or ammunition with guerrilla forces in latin america could open 
providing the us government with no evidence of arms or chavez leftist insurgency funding the insurgency . 
in addition , said military analyst for the farc to colombian guerrillas have specialist for the military and the rebels have plenty of money for weapons from drug trafficking interests without the rifle or from belgium to assist the old chavez 
a study report published by the defense intelligence agency and the us in 2003 originated weapons seized from guerrillas and colombia from 1998 and 2001 foreign military marked by more than half in venezuela . 
imply that can aid or military corruption , a member of the venezuelan military members are sympathetic to the guerrillas . 
the training may be distressed by the military and for new civilian reservist ideological critics say his mind . opponents of chavez more domestic 
calling chavez started a unit called revolution public units preparing the public to resist a superpower aggressor early so more in 2005 , saying the step is resistant to train him back up units of the armed forces on active duty and 100,000 volunteers 2 million years to come first . 
analysts estimate the number at 83000 military armed forces active duty of venezuela . 
created and defense units of neighborhood and state companies . the university , free university established under chavez unit that reports to the president directly . 
the government insists that the reserves will support the armed forces reserves not acting as a fifth column against a coup against chavez possible 
according to espinoza should reserve not used shock troops for any political party decides what each side in the civil war . 
he has been called in to julio ramon quintero viloria as general commander of the reserve 
according to quintero and his armed forces hope to train 50,000 civilians to force in the second half of 2005 over 20 weekends can be trained by forcing more than 300,000 civilians in 2006 in an interview

in the term coined by us military strategist describe conflict where combat is not a weak side employing more tactical guerrilla warfare is not symmetrical 
given by the us government for 3.3 billion dollars in aid to china of the most militarily in colombia in the past five years . 
loyal fears chavez instigated by the us government of colombia , venezuela , a proxy possible ouster and its control of oil . 
dismissing the us senior official to the notion that the government wants the united states to invade venezuela , no sense of complete and utter notion in an interview officials . 
the official said wishing to either side of chavez on the sides to make the relationship negative because they calculated to reach mr. chavez to power by confronting us political constantly . 
developing roll-back chavez military cooperation and joint exercises are another troubling to the united states . 
having us military organization cooperation office in fort venezuelan for 50 years . 
shutting down chavez it in 2004 . 
the order of five and those of us who participated in training and exchange programs for students participating leave in april 2005 . 
analysts said it is likely to try chavez indoctrination to his public and his armed forces .
