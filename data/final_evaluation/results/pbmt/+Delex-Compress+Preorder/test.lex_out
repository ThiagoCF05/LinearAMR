it will take , it will not long . 
late 2004 open running toward the circumference around the southwest quadrant of the richmond region new urban region to name route 288 highway
already it change development patterns due to worsening pattern and it caused localized congestion around its exit from trafficking . 
richmond times-dispatch told the today newspaper that the impact of the tale to a trail name huguenot road in the county .
by willing jones reported that traffic has more than doubled in a section of the huguenot name to trail the road since the open road .
as well as a surge of speed and the accident . 
so far this year reported 17 near by winterfield road intersects the road accident , up from 12 accident in all 2004
virginia department of transportation residents of engineers , dale totten , notes that if the government had more money at a cost of about $ 13 million 4 lane road .
of course , the government does not have the money for the construction of roads in the richmond region .
vdot 288 roads spent all its money frigging local politicians and people because of a boost
when you need people . where are the homer simpson
this is a major moment . doh ! 
route 288 road we predicted , generating residential development at a scarcely populated areas in all around the exit of the road overtax to local country road .
other people choose a location where people work and location where people live . but can a limited access highway traffic relief drivers back and forth in chesterfield county county between goochland county county .
and creating a congestion of trafficking in new places . 
i am surprised how rapidly this would only 
even i think they can lag years or a year .
do you think the sunni created for all christian exit liable route 288 road already created at a cost of $ road construction in just these 1 exit !
another predictions 
soaring need a new road improvement after more in a few years , scattered subdivision development and approval of mega projects in commerce 288 road intersection of a major road .
well , we can see no zoom fund liability to the well , the original original by building the highway took $ past before the end of the decade .
i say the brainiac who think the road is such a great idea .
thanks for nothing . 
i think it can be better spent elsewhere . $
i think you did not blame 288 road to those people should be created .
if enough of them who are creating a new they traffic congestion at the alternative in the new place . 
additional traffic congestion to the old place ? 
now you understand what people like tmt in fairfax feel
i usually take my position in favor of the road . 
but the road is definitely excess with a glaring need in other part of the state .
richmond virtually no have traffic .
rush hour last minutes .
and you give them a beltway through largely rural areas . 
the road to nowhere . 
just think ! could spend another where the cross river potomac facilities or desperately needs in the region to improve the road for this money .
i said the rest of the state to help pay for the rest of the road during the last year to deal with the budget . adding insult to injury , so pay the debt wiped out virginia centrist people named
very nice if we are obliged to by all of you . 
not much sense , though . 
it was the same old problem . 
if you get ahead , you are accused of need you so sprawling 
if you build in a place where there is already an acute need to claim you could not pave your way out of congestion 
an anonymous person called 
that is a fair point . 
by 5:26 makes a good point . 
but this situation will hammer the validity of what state for audit report found that instead of funding is based on a comprehensive plan to transport to the states is based on the people who best lobbying by ctb and the vdot funding for transportation projects to the home .
i submit that this is not a situation a disgrace , that should be tolerated . 
and the senator and his toady poured more money for this flawed institution . the reason for this worse .
what is the purpose of the expenditure on transport things . 
in that state . it is the point is to benefit private business plan and it will not serve the interests of the public .
dead wrong . to all of you . 
no less stated that the money was intended to pay for economic development from 288 road .
come on , folks . 
i said that i do not understand their point to people named tmt 
the last time when not you are some sort of business or you were from business you are stuck in traffic . 
it seems to me that the whole point of the road to the roads to facilitate the public interest for the public to get private businesses and the public would get from the business . 
despite the need to support the business , of course , were driven in a soccer game on sunday and a trip to grandmother overwhelming location . 
no wonder we suffer the problem of congestion is not match what we expenditure on the road to what increased business or because state domestic product . 
if we recognize the primary road business benefits , we should do a couple of things .
by the business to pay for what business , of course , for the passing of the w more of us transportation bill ! and incentives for businesses to locate business in businesses are the least stressed that even if the system is to locate more overall travel means business ! 
so hard to understand why was it 
solution is for a functioning human settlement patterns and the balance for the transportation capacity of the system for land use will generate demand for travel . 
spinning all else . 
emr 
by tmt said in that state . it is the point is to benefit private business plan and it will not serve the interests of the public .
i do not see this statement appears to point to things , demonizing private business plans and putting the public interest because above all else . 
i think they are intertwined because they have virtually the same tight government 
obviously , the local problem is this lumpy , cookies , so the dough ) . 
but if we long enough to demonize business . eventually , we found that we all work for the devil . in aggregate 
i do not see the purpose of the claims of the solution is to balance with ever changing dynamic nature . 
even when you see the airport rail to dulles airport to positive was the jobs center to promote bidirectional because demand for rail .
i agree . 
in fact , maybe that is a reason to build it all sufficient on their own . 
all i said to apply for exactly the same logic should be on the road . 
that they should have a destination on both ends for us to maximum use of what we invest 
we need more places in order to get closer to you are saying we need to balance 
check with the reality here . 
i drove through landing called watkins to name the facility the past . every morning and evening 
i commuted back and forth to where i work via huguenot name road to a trail . 
i have never seen anything remotely like the flood of traffic . 
it zone 55 mile-per-hour speed-quantity where between 75 per 100 how long morning car .
already plans to widen the name called huguenot to trail the road of development in the county side heavy demand and new schools , a whole bunch of zone in the years ago , funneling via robious road before the development because what exists .
instead of south africa and a lack of road bottleneck powhatan county and western chesterfield county wonderful 288 road , for those of us who actually use the road .
we can for commercial development , and we can work in closer and closer to our lives . 
you may think that is land use irrational 
i do not desire to live in any city . 
i refuse to work in the downtown area . 
i refuse to use mass transit do not commute was safe . a female , long - hour work . without regular work . 
and i happen to like the development of a large lot . 
i do not understand exactly how i keep horses in 14 acres a lot , i suppose .
is it possible to go 1 gallons of gas for $ 10
and i still pay for living in the country . 
many people prefer horses legitimate garden in certain types of small businesses and the hunt that make people do not want to live in the urban core . 
for me , this infatuation with live in cities , truly baffled . 
said if they wish to live , they have every right to live in the country , to the people named anonymous , 6:37 
you no right to the rest of the state underwrite the cost of the construction of the $ highway for easier to shop and get to work , but
consistently overlooked what else could be spent $ 288 road of a debate .
if applying for money with the other road projects press or even god forbid ! no road projects can alleviate much of the congestion on the traffic . 
it said that direct comment to investors lobbied places near the road to the road to own property and incompetent a system no matter what the links with a master plan for the transport or lack of links to fund this request to ray hyde

they showed absolutely no respect . 
by that i say hello to someone from the university and someone to ignore . but minutes later , someone decided that someone wants to help some work with someone and give help to someone , for example .
it has caused a lot of anger in my life and distress in life and it really started to affect my concentration in the university . 
anyone got any anyone experience for anyone to handle this sort of thing , or how to go again , gained some respect ? 
you just said no , 
if you were , it is not particularly comfortable . you have to do it gradually 
you can start with sorry not to , but i was busy . 
with it , of course , did not go over the top in order to not go in the complete opposite direction . 
if you think you have no mind . you say america 
they have started more respect when they are starting to realize that you are not bending over backwards for them . 
well , this is really such a bad attitude . of course , if you are nice you are not nice to you just let them do anything to you , but you can respect :snt3 that that is not nice to fool people . but the

i leave home in september and i started from university . i was incredibly anxious about doing this , but i delayed it . this is what i think until i got here . i feel it was all terribly overwhelmed and i feel i am not intelligent and social :snt3 awkward . i have been here now and i will over the weeks are here .
i emotionally struggle for the majority of my life . even though i lost my dad was around my years old and i always blamed the loss on what i feel since i moved to secondary school , i had in my life . period of my counsel december 2009 march around this year for month - roughly multi-sentence
i felt like part of the problem is i live not credible overwhelmed and i made me doubt my always low self esteem ever more when i got the moments i doubt about anything and everything . i was not able to concentrate on my work . and i find that when i became a social occasion . i was often very quiet . 
my people , my counsel not diagnosed with depression and suggested to me that i did not suffer from depression but a huge depression me worry . depression , so my dad died because of their suicide because
i am trying to solve my problem before and i find it particularly useful for exercise and meditation , and i also tried things like self help book and tape to help . but i am general feels that this is what i live ? i waste my one chance , my existence and my one chance . i was a young man at :snt4 i beat this feeling away multi-sentence

was that he would be a new situation and feel the pressure he socialized with strangers and fit their new role , such as students at the university to become what people feel people existing more intense things in common . 
i am not a professional health and i could only speak from personal experience , and so i strongly suggest that you see a qualified health professional about what your feelings of depression and depression you worry you . 
by most people feel there is no intelligence and awkward 1 get university , so you are definitely not alone in university . but you get you an appointment for counselling services in your university . i really do . you should not really matter if anyone told you last year , depressed or not :snt4 depressed last year , you obviously have some problems in minutes . and , you can use some of you support the labels are not as important as what you experience by to meditate and exercise really helpful because you tried to do and :snt7 but you have to engage to help and general life in order to get you somewhere , but you do not beat up on you . you feel you have no motivation to do anything because when :snt8 minutes . a lot of people feel that things like this and when y8 begin to feel better , hopefully to pass things :snt9 you not kind to you , only you feel worse :snt10 you kind ! you and get some help at you ,
good luck . 
i think that a lot more people feel the same way you felt but medicate people using his friends , it is probably not as such a solution definitely better when you were depressed , you are your friends around than you are alone and depressed , but either way , if you fancy yourself chatting to feel free to me in private you multi-sentence message . 
if i were you i would focus on idol , you have someone like those aspirations ended up married to someone who , etc someone successful and happy someone , someone has a family of someone coming from bad backgrounds that you are not you want someone you admire . but you respect . 
do you focus on what you achieve in life , you have not stated what you study , or indeed why studies by you want you experienced ? so on by y4 mum wanted to go ? :snt5 because you need a degree for career you want ? why . 
you have something you can say like , hey , i am not a failure and work hard on it and i pass when you got your degree , so either way you sum , why you were there and you work on your bottom off in order to get the best possible grade

i found i always , every time i went out to check , especially university what belongs to me . i make sure i have not lost anything . nor have i left anything because , in the past year . so i think i got a form of ocd .
i often have to twice every 1 go checks and after 30 seconds . for some reason not to , then i can resist , i checked again .
why this 
i craze or something ? 
:snt1 it most often when it but it rarely carry things carry many things and it even that many still . every day , check ; this is called ocd name any extent disease ?
what can i do about this . 
if i do not check what i am getting sort of go away after 30 minutes . very anxious , but not much , so i could get that long wait often anxiety .
i feel if i lost my wallet , my phone , or that i am doomed or i feel doomed 
i just wish i could i not every 2 minutes worried i left something or i lost something going out .
i really do not know what i did and i was afraid that i went to a gp 
probably they never heard some compulsion . like this , and i just do not know what to do 
any of you have a ritual like ? 
people think i was crazy . but you will get you out of this very strange difficult . 
my advice ? you can . 
i used to do this my way into college :snt2 have a list on me . i know i have the items and i used to check on a bus multi-sentence compulsive manner . 
so , you just try to when the habit is relatively fresh weaned and habits , but also you will tell you that you do not keep you check these things you definitely visit your doctor i have more severe anxiety now , and i think this is a warning sign . i know that it is easier to say than to do . 
he is to see a much more bad case that is not because you worry ! 
i do :p :subevent about the disease . today , about a psychology class .
are you just avoid acting with a compulsive way possible to get rid of it , because you have not checked ! you lost something , and you just leave it ! 
the law has gradually decreased , so hopefully when overtime disappear . your ocd disease despite increasing your anxiety level for duration
for just that sounds rather than you have a really bad ocd disease you are overly anxious
i am very obsessed by my times . 20 per nights , got up to check in particular are a lock to lock all in my house .
sometimes , i was convinced that they are not a lock , but i know they lock 
i think that it becomes a real problem when started obsessed really interrupted your every day routine .
your definitely not crazy so you not to worry , and i am sure that your gp understand the issue . 
i went to therapy for others also reason and i encourage them . i cut down i pick the obviously 20 less than the number of times i check and i stick to the numbers . 
i think the idea is taught to me and if i checked five times or 20 times . i still check is ok . 
i have a lot more good so far , and i think that definitely hopeful that anyone who wants to improve the improvement . 
too much , of that i am not worried . usually , i was pretty calm about things , and i would like to take it as it comes to things 
but i find i became really anxious about what for the last month and a month and i am not talking mere feel nervous from the blue .
i am beginning to feel me beforehand . i am not too much worried about a variety of things that not even cross my mind as something to ring alarm bells in my head to irrational panic . 
i am not sure that the change in lifestyle to go for care - free student to graduate and unemployed people . because of this , or this is a signal for other issues ? but began this bugs me . this affected my confidence and i am happy because 
i speak it with few parents . but the same people all think i am going in random phase to me , until it is clear the serious problem i held off and i should act . 
so wondering what is the best thing to do . 
you speak it to the doctor and you saw the pill can counter anxiety ? from what have been taken off the edge . 
i see that i can speak to the people who counsel ? 
or should i take what close people around me advice and until becoming an anxiety problem . just my eyes anxiety ? 
well not start . i try to keep an eye on your anxiety as the eye is making me tense and more likely to panic , because the more you should circle the demise in there . 
try when you start to feel a bit of anything you as-soon-as panic , you focus on something that guarantee that makes you smile or feel it more . i should be happy . 
if you cannot do that , or you get to your friend . people make you laugh when you start , you feel panic :snt2 lol . to me , it works and i have suffered in random multi-sentence of panic attacks . 
starting just started . i was a tiny thing really worried , although not as severe . from the sound of things than you . 
i found that just talking about what makes you are anxious for someone else to help 
i found that made me feel better about things , so i know there are no big deal . and i do not need to be . i was anxious about what i mentioned i was worried what my mum and i see people react to a situation of calm . should i react , but perhaps not moaning that way . 
but if it is worse . you go to the doctor . 
i have a friend who suffered severe anxiety that people may prevent people leave the house and people will do what people are so worried about things that could go wrong , because that thing . 
doctors give the medication for her , and they make good with her much more
