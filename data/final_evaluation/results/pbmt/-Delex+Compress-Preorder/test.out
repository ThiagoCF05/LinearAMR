resolute support to start a thread i reply , composed a poem 
pledging to fight to defend the diaoyu islands , and island - related death . 
the japanese fishing boat bump evil little ghosts stirred up trouble , and they show their appearance unrest wolfish again with a heart and a thief arrogance form . 
do not go back to that time when we appeared humiliated when we have ever signed , strongly backed the chinese sharp shine and buried the enemy approached . 
9 , 11 , 2010 . 
bump up resolutely i agree with your analysis . i like hua mulan thread started , i was in our home , and to protect and defend our homeland , to spread the prestige of our chinese pledges to fight to defend the dignity of our nation to death . if i come to the real war . 
i wish i was born during the long march that the passionate in the upsurge of mao zedong , in order to lose my head , i shed my blood enemy , extinguishing all wrong for china to complete our prestige is spreading dragon very much . 
how long would we tolerate japan . 
according to fellow citizens . 
hello , everyone in japan , however , plans for another incident at lugou bridge in the sea , sea another premeditate like me now . we all know that september 18th again . 
defying world condemnation and the country as a whole , surprisingly strong invasion of our country sacred territory diaoyu open 
always the diaoyu islands belong to china . we all know history is reason to become our belongings , the original controversy . 
our thing , and our thing is why my fellow citizens need to negotiate because the japanese went even further , creating want to occupy the facts can we allow this ? absolutely not . 
i said , japanese militarism brought grave disaster to the asian people , fellow citizens . 
china has suffered , especially japanese ravage the country for as long as several decades 
the japanese unit 731 experiments . china life and the people who live in korea . people who live in other countries , the human body extremely cruel , brutal methods in the northeast of nanjing massacre added to blood layers never faded away in the ancient capital city , barely , and big , bloody battle in changsha and hengyang bones of the dead , the battle over 1,000 km kill off everything . 
saying too many instances of heinous crimes japan committed in china , recorded a difficult way with no exhausted all bamboo strips , citing fellow citizens . 
like the wandering souls of those deceased and tens of millions of lives lost over the pacific ocean , the soul , the soul will find difficult to just rest in peace . 
all experienced that era remember vividly era is still crying , and our younger generation , even the tears stream down our cheek , also is in our blood boiled with indignation when turning the pages of this history , and any page reads . 
japan wants to reverse the verdict of history , so its aggression now actually wanted to wake up fellow citizens of china and asia . 
we have to face them , we will go on despite the pain , we were looking at this 100 - year history , it would be a shame to back . we have to create a historic choice not to resolve the history issue . 
so we are not afraid of the responsibility , however , they are related to a matter of dignity , a small territory to guarantee the interests of national unity and honor . no matter how changing clouds , wind , and we could not let separated from our native land , land , land , despite the scar was wounded . 
as i said , it means the advent in the 21 st century beset inside difficult but it is time for the chinese nation , face the press outside , many thing to challenge fellow citizens . 
we should go on the taiwan issue , tibet issue or the south china sea issue surrounding environment for foreign forces , in what way , aggressive , to china . 
fellow citizens , i do what you please look at a map of the world to suppress the encirclement and crescent - shaped breath . we developed a coveted encirclement encirclement strangle our national territory . 
never fear , though . we do not want to make an enemy . we are not afraid , but we do not want war . 
we have to arrange our arms and strengthen its military forces on the land , sea and air with all urgency . 
however does not have the ambition of the territories of the new expanded outward ever flourishing nation . china has several times for thousands of years . 
so does not impose what they want and not the other . we follow the philosophy applies to foreign security strategy of benevolence and virtue . 
like the liberalness liberalness tolerance and tolerance and individual , but we must insist that we do not avoid the hurt , we hurt others . 
certainly not afraid and tolerance must not be sincerity is cowardice 
the exemption will serve china and japan to repair war since world war ii . with peace , benevolence 
i said a condensed history of the chinese nation to strive to improve the nation continue to be people &apos;s heroes monument fellow citizens . 
the magnificent represent sacred solemn posturing is expected to peace . 
agitated many heroic tragic scenes that have sprung up in shining armor horses , spears and stir in my mind . my memory is a string of occasional thoughts . 
what is going on . i think that is history , like the yellow pages to see kangxi and contemplate how to achieve unification , territory alone . his audience hall over the past hundreds of years . the rule of the emperor to the famous generation abraham lincoln also was wandering the great hall alone in the dark to think the integrity of the union . the former u.s. president . 
forget is dangerous , but war is certainly peaceful . in the world according to me . however , not ever , must exercise forbearance . we want development and peace , fellow citizens , aggravated the boxer protocol betrayed and humiliated nation . china is a poor and backward country is falling behind in modern times , leading to the bully 
what if peace comes from strength , not 
we have to . we will focus on education and national defense . we build up a great wall . in the heart of the 1.3 billion people we established full - range system , capable of attacking and defense system . a national defense system . 
should strengthen the forces engaged in and force the ultra long range attacks can improve combat capabilities in all the great distance great depths in the aerospace and defense industries to increase investment in the construction industry and accelerating the modernization of military equipment and the high - tech elite division internationalize establishing high quality premises to avoid influencing the development of the national economy , defend the best attack . 
horn sounded and about to battle is already fully equipped , ready to go . 
but we will accomplish nothing . we are not powerful , with the support of all of us that we support . 
in time , when we said no to others . my fellow citizens , we have to have we achieved . 
first , establish a fund guarantee mechanism , work to improve the working environment for the recruitment of hundreds of thousands of professionals who emigrated to the united states and around the world linger information back to china . 
the two created a few aircraft carrier battle group . the nuclear power . 
three manufacturing 5,000 various kinds of advanced combat aircraft . 
the four are accelerating research and high - speed ballistic missiles of intercontinental range more than 10,000 nautical mile break could deploy missiles and missile defense systems . 
5 and resume nuclear experiments to establish a military force in space . 
six thousand nuclear bombs and retain tens of millions of tons of tnt to install nuclear warheads on missiles and short - range missiles in the middle range , while all need to be installed . 
to retain strategic nuclear submarines , 7 , 30 , are capable of inflicting devastating enemy nuclear submarines , three strikes . 
eight abandoned the commitment not to use nuclear weapons first . 
nine preempt retained the right to strike at the threat to national security . 
we can strive for . if we are strong and we are confident we will improve only my fellow citizens . the unification of qin shi huang , china , recovery of taiwan , zheng chenggong , we must carry on far seen insight and strong will . we are responsible for our predecessors 
shaking a piece of land and the motherland , embrace a far piece that tremble moaning to carry what is now called the previous general wish fulfillment , not fellow citizens courageous move forward forward . 
simmer heaviness and anger in my heart when i read history into concerns me . however , i am willing and i served our country to volunteer for a splendid and prosperous motherland . once again , there was no regret even if i die , i was born to cloth gown and common people is adequate to show sincere heart . my patriotic heaven . 
here , i composed a poem in the form of ci classical voice . my heart to aspire to . 
lips painted a deep red . 
to protect the diaoyu islands . 
we have lost our bitter ryukyu islands . 
the diaoyu islands could be allowed to fall into how other countries . 
100 years of vicissitude 
chase the flying waves , clouds and smoke . 
youth is still tender , the youngest brother . 
wander was born in all directions and seals . 
looking over the flag 
brandishing us and our weapons cross the east . 
let the drink of the pacific ocean . 
6 26 , 2002 . 
the title of the book and other articles for the taiwan compatriots to have a dream , i needed to build a museum or memorial temple , a national hero in china , though , how long it will tolerate no begging the olympics ever . expect more history if we forget history , hardship , hardship of the people i was one nation and one culture is the only country in the country , the state could decline in sports ? or overdevelop the country strong and the people wealthy officials and wealthy and poor students ren zhiqiang shut his mouth disgusting . housing prices , hateful people can pity for google , said the company does not have the right to remark on what the us is not responsible for what japan deserves to present strong opposition ban ki @-@ moon bouquets on the strength of the hiroshima bomb . my brother and sister ? we need a star or a low level of innovative talent entertainment technology . please ! let li yinhe , garbage wrote in contemporary children off , nothing to be ashamed of . 
why do we are not to fight a little japanese . 
china , which is still tolerated . 
they ride even in our heads . 
chinese people doing ? this is still gutted 
we should tell china can not be bullied by others at will on the whole world . 
it is time that we showed we are strong in china too long , calm . 
is the carefree life of our citizens . currently , all officials are too extravagant , too . 
we had no cohesion has already started the war what china needs now is a slap in the face of the country following the harsh rear of the united states . 
let them know that the us is not a panacea , could increase the influence of china . if we win . to improve the cohesion and the citizens , we could clean out competent bureaucrats not to make us the trash get out if we lose and let china has updated and new blood , china gets up . 
the chinese go . 
i would suggest that china will strengthen the guard of the diaoyu islands , and guard the island daily to protect fishermen and the sovereignty of our country . we are fighting a small - scale war how we defend japan if they dare to invade our territory by military force regardless of the costs . china may not be lost . 
but in life , we need to show it is really showing you embrace . 
just as i was passing by 
these star - like the whole society . 
not sexy , damn . 
the total might not accept it . 
entertainer cheap just agreed with them , in a sense , somewhat feudal china . 
they live in the glorious look 
group 9 profession . 
life is hard . 
shock 
that was normal and heartless whore is righteous , not always a performer . 
they want money , but they do not want to face . 
ms. fans looking for wolves near the glasses , you know , actors have to drink with him , if not force or out , not even framed . 
son of a bitch . 
ok , as long as something to eat loveliness 
no one is easy . you have to look like a live show . the script , you have to know how to perform 
somebody is all . 
imperial examination scores , people of all walks of life at the top of the 360 effort and endeavor to imperial examination scores behind them . so the word at the top of this humiliation bean vermicelli 
haha . 
overdo 
reality . 
that shot of hooligans . 
cheap performer . 
cheap performer . 
the entertainment circle dirty birds and beasts that all men are scum it . 
not that easy for a female star . but what a pity . they blame . 
everybody did this , how can you make money if you do not do this . 
a proud , but a woman in front of other women , are melancholy mood when the woman was staying alone . 
prostitution just popular people in ancient time , the star is nowadays is plainly put prostitution because they are famous people . now , normally they should drink or high officials , with some people . they just sleep . even the official . 
just stop talking and other behavior . 
what we should be doing in the future ability alone is not enough to succeed . we face ? such hard choices , too . 
disguise suffered more . look at the glorious is indisputable . 
because they played in a circle , they are just out to see out of mind . it is not so bad . 
zhang jizhong , old guys , but they behaved in a virtuous circle of guys to think a guy not talent is also making a tv series . when you have a guy who is a wreck and do nothing for the people of the whole country . 
both take the needs of both . 
china could have a purely innocent girl , what time it is ? 
now the entertainment world is very shocking stories and rumors that hsu yuki was forced out because he refused to drink with the guests . the arrangement switch to the lawyers must work in order to make ends meet , instead . 
he encountered the super star much envy and social engagements or the circumstances , but the people are not welcome to join or often . 
so did interest in many aspects and many , many will not be able to decide after all . 
no party can simply seems very normal ordinary people for dinner . we like that star and sometimes imagine . 
the stars will have a contract and a lot of rolling the money source if they tackle well , people have been forced out or come to frame her heel tack , even if she is not well . 
the first kind of held , and that very high integrity has always rejected such stern invited all the two kinds of female stars are smart . 
the second kind of good plays and trick to achieve their objectives on their seed money . 
rumors even some super star , who won the first of the female role this way : 
people who might have had a chance . and the ad sponsors for the shows that lie in the shoulder or a chin , feel part of the star female , female , female cheek kiss after drinking alcohol . some of the most enduring attitude will be adopted . 
they are the very people the lower 9 profession . 
that star is just pretending and living the life of a damn ! actually , much better than this . 
entertainer cheap just agreed with them , in a sense , somewhat feudal china . 
agreed . 
not easy . oh well , actress 
they deserve it . they asked for that . 
dawn was nothing easy for me . 
bird and beast and bad women are better than men . the birds and beasts

braawwkkk 
it did not take long . 
the highway will open a route running around richmond 288 quadrant of new urban region in southwest circumference late 2004 . 
it has changed and developed a pattern of worsening congestion because the pattern , it has caused around its exit localized traffic already . 
told the richmond times - dispatch , the impact of the huguenot tale trail powhatan county today . 
jones is willing to double traffic reports in a section of the trail more than 288 huguenot since opening . 
a surge of speed and the accident as well . 
17 accident near the intersection winterfield reported road accidents , up from 12 in all of 2004 . so far this year . 
dale totten noted that the virginia department of transportation engineers four lane road residents if they had more money , about $ 13000000 
vdot does not have the money for the construction of a road in the region of richmond , of course . 
vdot 288 spent all its money frigging because politicians and people to boost the local . 
homer simpson is what happens when you need people . 
this is a major moment , doh 
288 routes generated residential development in scarcely populated area around the exit of the road , and all the local roads we overtax predicted . 
but the other choice locations , where they work and where they live for limited access highways can relieve traffic . drivers between chesterfield county . the county goochland county toward the back and forth . 
the congestion , and they created a new place . 
i was surprised at how rapidly this would only 
even lags , i think maybe three or four years . 
think of all the exits of the sunni created liable to create 288 route . construction of the road would cost $ 13000000 exit just this one already . 
another predictions 
soaring new roads were needed to improve after scattered subdivision development and commerce intersect , 288 mega projects approved major roads . a few more years . 
we can see a liability fund zoom past $ 400 million not to take the highway originally built well before the end of the decade , as well . 
brainiac said , is such a great idea to think 288 route . 
thanks for nothing . 
i think we could be spent better elsewhere , for $ 400 million . 
i think you should not blame you for creating that 288 people . 
what is the alternative , if they have enough traffic congestion created them in a new place , new 
traffic congestion ? in the old place additional 
do you understand the feelings such as fairfax tmt now . 
i took my position usually favored on the road . 
but excess is definitely what 288 , with glaring need on the part of other states . 
richmond had virtually no traffic . 
during rush hours , lasted 30 minutes . 
and beltway through large rural areas would give them . 
the road to nowhere . 
think they can spend another cross the potomac facility or improving the roads in nova desperately need the money . just this . 
as i said , to help the rest of the state . the rest will pay for 288 on the budget deal last year . adding insult to injury , the virginia centrist wipe out the debt payments . 
very nice . we are obliged to all of you . 
but not much sense . 
it is the same old problems . 
you was accused of sprawling , because if you get ahead , you need . 
claiming that you will not be able to pave your way out of congestion . if you build an acute need is already in place . 
anonymous 
that is a fair point . 
5:26 makes a good point . 
hammer , but this situation report valid state audit to find funding for transportation projects vdot ctb and based on the best lobbyists rather than funding is based on a comprehensive plan to the state transportation into the home . 
i submit that this is a situation that should not be tolerated disgrace . 
chichester poured and the senator and his toady more money for this flawed institutions because this is worse . 
in what transportation expenditures . 
it will benefit plans to private businesses . it will not serve the interests of the public . virginia 
all of you are dead wrong . 
walter stoch , no less , said in a statement that the money was intended to pay for economic development for 288 
come on . 
i said that i did not understand his tmt points . 
stuck in the traffic when the last time when it was not or some sort of business from the business . 
the road will facilitate the road seems to be in the public interest for the public to get into private business and the public will get from the whole business to me . 
and despite the overwhelming support needed to drive sunday trip to a location of his grandmother , a soccer game , of course . 
no wonder the congestion problem suffered because they did not match the expenditures we road . what business or increase domestic products in the state . 
should do two things if we recognized the benefits of road primary business . 
to pay for that , and , of course , is what we passed our bills to transport more incentive to locate business , business , business , business with the least stress the system , even if it means to locate more travel overall . 
it is hard to understand why so . 
to solve the human settlement patterns and balance function . the capacity of the transport system and land use will generate demand for travel . 
all else spin . 
emr 
tmt said it and the benefit plans to private businesses . it will not serve the interests of the public . virginia 
i see no point of this statement appears to demonize and private businesses are planning to put their interests above all else . 
i think they are intertwined , because they are virtually the same tight 
a local problem , obviously , is a lumpy , so the dough . these cookies 
however , we found that we all work for the devil if we eventually . in the aggregate to demonize business long enough . 
i do not see a solution to the claims , the dynamics change , ever balance with nature . 
you even see a rail to dulles airport is positive , because the job centers to promote demand for bidirectional rail . 
i agree . 
maybe that is sufficient reasons to build it . in fact , all on their own . 
i say exactly the same logic should apply to all roads . 
they should have both destinations in the end to use maximum investments of us . 
we need more places in order to get us close to the balance we need to be better , you said . 
here is a reality check . 
i drove past . watkins landing in the morning and evening . 
i commuted to a location where i have worked towards huguenot trail . back and forth . 
i have not seen anything like the remote traffic flooding ever . 
it was 55 speed-quantity zone 75 per 100 cars in the morning for what 
plans to widen a huguenot already trail because the demand side chesterfield and heavy development in the new school . a whole bunch of development zones exist years ago robious funneled through road . 
the road is a wonderful 288 , for those of us who actually used the road instead of the bottleneck for lack of west chesterfield and powhatan county road . 
we can develop and commerce . we can work in close to better our lives . 
land use , you may think that is irrational . 
the desire to not live in any cities . 
i refused . i worked in the downtown area . 
i refuse to use mass transit , female unsafe work while commuting to work long , irregular hours . 
it happened , and i would like to develop a large lot . 
i do not understand how i keep horses . in the 14 acres of exactly what is supposed to be a lot . 
a gallon of gas could go for $ 10 . 
pay and still alive . 
many people prefer hunting horses and garden certain types of legitimate small businesses do not want to make a living in the urban core . 
infatuation baffled about i truly live in this city . 
every country has the right to live in anonymous if they wish to live , 6:37 
the right , but not the rest of the state underwrite the construction of highway cost 400 million dollars . the ease of shopping , and getting more work . 
what else was overlooked , consistent debate 288 spent 400 million dollars . 
traffic congestion could alleviate much if the money is applied to road projects or other press . the road project would not even be forbidden . 
according to the comments by direct and lobbying investors to place road near the road system , property owners are not competent to fund these requests , regardless of what links a master transportation plan or lack of ray hyde links . 
i was 24 years old , and his mother . 
i broke up with my father and son since august . 
i wanted to start dating , and others , i say that the father and son . if it has to do with people who have nothing to date . 
but the very possessive and he was very controlling . he does not have the right , because we were together 
and there is too much going on in his life right now . he thought we might work , but i was told that i did not love him , and i did not love him several times . 
i want him there for his son , he does not need me , too . 
however , he had no one in the family . he did not get along , and it had a family issue . 
i do not want anymore . i was miserable . i was more miserable . if he had been around longer . 
i do not want him there for his son is not the father , or at least try to good . 
i believe every child needs for both parents and children , but people were together , or are not together . 
but he thinks he can have my one if i can not to have him . 
what do i do ? i moved my life . 
using the son to threaten the ex is very bad . 
not to give in to that , because it just escalated . if you give in to that . 
you are right , you have to live your life , you are happy because you cannot cave . because of the threat posed by him . 
but he saw no matter if he loves his sons , really . just a typical method of control . this is used to like him . 
other people said things like to kill me if i left you get through it ? 
dates 
to meet all kinds of people . 
do what you want . 
you would be better off with him , you have no price would probably be better if he walks out of your life , both volunteer . 
one other thing , i agree , it is that he is not in the business of a date or not to date . 
i do not tell him . 
but not because of the threat posed by him because he was not concerned about your personal life . 
whether you can document his threat . 
you really need . 
quit and make you take his call to leave voice mail 
you make your email or text . 
to keep those records

hello , but i started at the university in september . the most obvious gel , not immediately . 
but i know i will take some time to adjust . i was shy and introvert very anxious , always , especially all the rest . 
go out and all my housemate , and the first night i was here the best to go out as hard as i have ever had to do . 
i went to the bar , the student union on their own . when i was sober 
the facts here . but more to the point , 
i did not enjoy . after i was here about five months disillusioned . i enjoy the course and i am not . i do not like the project , set to deliver much of the course . 
the university make out much better than it seems 
i started bad first - term student financial delays and added to the stress level . not because i was so worried about the progress of work because all the piles of conclusion . 
people who counsel assigned to me and the university to see about five weeks to six week session to block out and not see really never open up if an honest opinion . 
only half the heart . 
and i loaded into the neck of my work now . i must have hit a major deadline result i feel depressed and miserable all the time . 
i no longer have because you can have so many at a time . the only session i doubt much help this time . if not , i have already helped . 
lack of motivation and i do not feel comfortable with me as a person , but i feel i want to lecture i gave in , could not be brought about and ended up giving the job to end with someone to aspire to . i was dead . 
i would rather die and education and life , i do not live my life . i want the matter worse by dropping out . 
i and i turned 21 years for 22 years . this year i do not have much time left to fail . i must do something . 
i do not want to go through the system , and a consistent failure and i have failed over and over to college once did , i can get another course . 
can i please ? some advice . 
go and see a doctor , and you can see the way ? how to get your deadline extension to try to ease the pressure a bit , you can 
and like post sent this to your tutor to consider mitigating circumstances . not to worry , they all saw what ( including some admitted much more uncomfortable before . i know because i used to work in the administrative department . 
what broke the chunk could have managed to work . 
one of the things a bit concentrated work assignment of most urgently , obviously , for the first time , at a time . 
no shut-off housemate and well done because from the very beginning to try new things , keep it now . 
i recommend that you go see your doctor , you are , too . 
you might benefit from a speech . if a friend is always anxious to get therapy for the nhs because it really was normal anxiety . 
i am sure you will allow the university to be honest and trying to get the deadline extended . 
got to keep strong and keep hard lives on . 
the divorce of my mum and she had a horrible time . i found that with her new stepfather , sending her on her rounds to bend 
she is . she has epilepsy and manic depression , with huge anger problems . 
for me , she is horrible . constantly . 
unable to cope with her outburst and that her remarks were hateful nasty . while i was at home . 
bursary people full time , 95 percent of students were in private schools . high pressure in the sixth , in the form of an 18 - year - old , i was the breaking point . 
i will not be able to work at home because she shouts at me . 
the teachers are angered by me , because i was then . 
she is lovely , and in one minute i had me like a mummy back . she turned into the most spiteful human life . then , in the next minute . 
nor do i passed my exam , they make me accept defeat this year of my life . i have already failed . 
maybe i can come back from this , who knows ? but most amazing offer . i could not accept even offered to make the grade , not ever . 
i wish she could have wiped from my life . things are good on so much worse without her . 
i think i am selfish but just then . 
however , that does not mean that i have lived like this for sure . 
the best and should be better for so much . 
but i feel like i have no control over the downhill spiral towards this . 
i do not know what to do . 
thank you for reading . 
nice vented . 
she could not get a section of that . 
she had a history of mental illness or even diagnose 
you did not know you are not going to get good grades , to accept a place sure if it can be accepted . 
what life throws at you all the time . 
if outsiders , not someone in your family . 
i must deal with dad and verbal abuse , long before i came to 8 years . the only reason is that it is the only way to get out . to be honest i was here . 
if you really work hard , you want out . 
sounds like you need to support yourself from somewhere else . if she could not give a real consistent . 
maybe ? childline or something similar called the organization . 
you can go to the library and study the library 8 hours on saturday . good . 
whether you can go to your house of friends formed a study group . 
and because she is a bit of a pain in the arse to blame for all the problems of the y section ? you want her . 
i know what you feel . 
spit my mum from hell , too . 
i recommend a high take up smoking . 
tsr , who grew up stopping nag and oh , it was a joke . 
i think i will become weak , and much more . a year ago , two years . my personality is trying to dull down some friends on the way between the universities . 
but a nice lead over people can believe or say whatever the hell out of people . i want to do whatever to me . 
they show absolutely no respect for them . 
for example , someone and say hello , but i ignore someone decided that someone wants to help me , some works better to give 30 minutes late to help someone . 
and it has caused anger in my life and a lot of distress in life . it has affected my concentration started in the university , really . 
anyone ? get a handle or experience for this sort of thing has some way to go to gain respect any again . 
just said . 
if you do it gradually , not particularly comfortable with it . 
you can start with is not sorry , but i was busy . 
you are not going to go over the top with it . of course , if you are not completely in the opposite direction . 
if you think the mind of america said . 
they have started to respect them more when they are starting to realize that you are not bending over backwards for them . 
is this really such a bad attitude can respect you , well , nice . nice , but not you . you just let him do anything , of course . but that is not a nice person . that is a fool . 
but i do not know whether anyone reads this , i am feeling desperate and i just felt i needed someone to tell me . 
i left home and when september started for the university . but i was anxious about the delay . i would have done this . this is incredible . i think until i got here . now here i am , and i have been here for over two weeks . i feel overwhelmed and it all feels not terribly intelligent and i was socially awkward . 
i have struggled with emotional and despite the fact that the majority of my life . i lost my dad , around 9 years i blamed the loss on what i always felt since i moved to secondary school , two of my counsel , i have a period when i lived in 2009 . december this year around march for roughly 15 months . 
i felt like an overwhelming problem of my life and not credible . i made i doubt always low self esteem ever more of me at the moment , inability to concentrate and work . i became very quiet found social occasion as often . i doubt about anything and everything . 
but the two are not being diagnosed with depression . to suggest i would counsel not suffer depression . depression is a huge worry to me because my dad died for his suicide . 
i tried to solve the problem of me before i found particularly useful exercise and meditation to try things like books and tapes , self help . help also . but i feel i live ? this is a general waste a chance . i had a chance and i was one of the young men is the one to beat this feeling away at me . 
and i do not know what i did was simply not follow-through copyright trade . when i think of what i would ever do . a friend said i was lazy and often could not disagree with a lot of time . i feel like everything anyone is doing is trying to help their time could fail again . 
and i am sorry for anyone reading this jumble mess . but i feel like a bit of moaning people seeking self . i felt i was truly desperate 
it is not uncommon to become what people feel exists as one of the more intense , people are feeling the pressure of the new situation and socializing with strangers and fits the new roles , such as students . 
no professional and i was healthy maybe i speak from my personal experience , so i suggest you only see a qualified health professional about your feelings and depression , you do worry about is strong . 
most people feel they are not intelligent . and when they get the first awkward because you are not alone . at the university , definitely i would recommend that you get the appointment , but counseling services in the university . you really do not matter to tell , depressed or not depressed last year last year , you really have some problems , obviously , and in minutes you could use some support is not important compared to what you will experience is what the labels really meditate and exercise is helpful because you try , but you do have to engage , but life in general , has helped to get somewhere and not beat up because they feel they have no motivation to do anything in a minute . and a lot of people feel like this is what passed at the beginning y8 hope you feel better is not kind to you , only you feel worse and you kind of get some help . 
good luck . 
i think i feel a lot more , but you feel the same way . by using the medications people , friends , as such a solution . but it was probably not a good friend if you are around when you were depressed , would be better than being alone and would definitely be depressed if you feel free to chat with fancy private message either way . 
i focus to idol if you aspire to be someone , such as someone who came from a bad background ended up with success , and someone who has happily married family , etc. however , you do not want them . you are someone you admire , you respect . 
focus on what you achieve in life . you have not stated that the studies or by you . indeed , the study , so why do you want to experience y4 ? mum wants you to go . you need a degree for career you want . 
in sum , and why you are there your bottom off to work . to get the best possible grades because you have something that you can say , for example , does not fail , and hey , it works is hard to pass , and when you get a degree either way .

i hope this helps . 
not autistic , but i have not been diagnosed by doctors who misdiagnose dyspraxia but i thought i was pretty much walking on my toes and nearly all of the time . 
i was more comfortable with it . 
what makes their decision to sign toe autism because it seems so random is no indication always walked the walk . 
but i can have something where signs of autism spectrum who have no signal one thing , or two things well , with signals . 
the guy , you know what i mean . 
the symptoms of autism is able to walk on their toes . 
possible brain tumor symptom is headache 
could be symptomatic of leukaemia , tired and felt a lot of times . 
but the symptoms are not always apply if the note is worth a lot of cases , the symptoms clear in this instance because nothing ever diagnosed if not noted . 
but i walked on my toes because a strange , born with toes curl under straighten from surgery two years ago , had to walk . 
but my brother is autistic , but i have not noticed either autistic spectrum so broad and mildly aspergers probably me because i have a communication problem and pick it up , not me . the body language / social reaction . 
but i did not have the proper things even had some of the symptoms , that does not mean that you have certain conditions can then . 
so tell not walking on my toes and me for years . i walked on my toes . not much . 
i have dyspraxia 
dyspraxic or have the tendon can be so short . 
drilling students do dance / etc. on it . i find it more comfortable now . 
i have not read of random symptoms like that too much . 
hello , a 12 year old girl , age 13 , after two days , i was addicted to harm self . 
i started with my fingers . scissors slit each individual . when i was seven years i never stopped . from that day . 
it is worse because i have a scar on my leg because i slit legs . one of the staples of my name ex boyfriend because i would not stop if i bleed cuts . 
i have several slit in my arms . 
i healed them and cut with a razor and then the staples robbery school . 
i took paracetamol and around five other drugs i take with lager and vodka could not find cuts . 
i was tempted to cut my arm , or i burned really as i write this . 
i am addicted to cut again when healed one . 
i think of it every day . 
for 12 years , and i am sick of my life already . 
source : my dad left when i was 7 years old , i know anymore , do not want this . 
he took care of his little girl , and his new wife , his new life , where i just did not want . 
my mates dead . i would be the best in ten years . 
and i have a relationship with a boy at the age of 16 , i was forbidden to speak to the boys , and because of the age difference . 
my mum is suffering and also have a bipolar depression . 
i do not want to stop me . 
i do not care what they have done to me . i want to do the things i once tortured again and again . i hate me . 
however , my love and my best mate load means the world to me . if he did do anything . 
i have not told him . but he found out . 
i do not want to hurt him . i did not want to hurt him . 
what do i do ? 
thanks for reading . 
you ? or on any of the drugs . the drug will get any therapy . 
should talk to your school nurse or your gp told or what was going on . 
can you trust the people you can tell schools to teach 
you can help if you told people . 
it is likely only to worsen bottle-up if you keep it inside . 
i trust that these things do get good . the earliest as possible instead of letting things get worse and even worse 
please do not do this . 
but at 17 years and self harm started cutting my arms last year , mainly to stop harm over the past few months . 
it is hard , but you can do it . 
i am happy , but i feel so much more scar to remind you that i saw and what i felt at that time was so strong . i want to do such a thing to me . my pain . 
also strong , and you can do it . i find that keep a journal , writing poetry and salvation 
self harm is addictive but you can overcome the harm 
remember self harm does not define who you are 
it can be overcome . 
so i check the belongings found that i always make sure i have not lost or anything . i have not left anything . every time i go out , especially at the university this past year . i think i got so form of ocd 
i have two checks , and i had to go and often could not resist one check again after 30 seconds . then , for some reason . 
why is this . 
or something ? 
it is most often and when many things to carry it , carry it . but what is rare , one of many checks every day . even still , ocd ? this is the disease to any extent . 
what can i do about this . 
however , i get very anxious sort of go away . after 15 to 30 minutes , if not much anxiety in check , because i could not wait that long . often . 
i feel i am doomed , or if i lost my wallet , or my phone is doomed to feel . 
i wish i could go out . i am not worried about me or something . i have lost something just as every two minutes . 
i do not know what to do . i am really afraid to go to my general practitioner 
they have not heard , and some probably never like this compulsion . i dont know what i just did . 
have any of you ? like ritual 
but i was crazy to think that it would be difficult to get out of this very strange . 
how could you advise me . 
this is what i do . i use on my way to college , and i have a list . i know i have items on compulsive use to check on the bus . 
i know that is easy to be better said than done severe anxiety , and i have more now . i think this is a warning sign , so you try and weaned on habits , habits are relatively fresh , just to visit the doctor to tell you , but definitely not keep you check these things also . 
in the worst case , because to see a doctor is not worried about much more than that . 
i do about ocd :p psychology class today . 
maybe the way to get rid of it is to avoid the compulsive act that just because you are not checked , and you lose something . it just left . 
l has decreased gradually so your ocd disappeared in overtime , but hope to increase the level of anxiety for the duration of your 
that sounds overly anxious , you instead of you have ocd is really bad for just me . 
i was very obsessed 20 one night , got up to check the lock was locked in my house are all particularly 
i am convinced that they are not locked in . i know that they sometimes lock 
i think it will become a real problem when they start interrupted your routine , really every day . 
and definitely not crazy not to worry , i am sure you understand gp issue . 
i went to therapy for other reasons also encourages a number , and obviously i picked less than 20 times to check my stick . i cut down on the numbers . 
and i think the idea of teaching is still okay , or if i check . i checked the 5 20 
i have good , better , and so far i think there are a lot of hope for anyone who wants to improve the definite improvement . 
and i am pretty calm about the usual things that i like , i take it as i have come not to worry too much . 
but the find really become anxious over the past months , two months , i am not talking about a mere feeling of nervous from the blue . 
i began to feel a variety of panic . i did not worry too much , as does not cross my mind as something because of alarm bells ringing in my head . i even irrational . 
but i am not sure whether lifestyle changes or go for students , free to take care of these unemployed graduates , this is a signal to other issues . this is beginning to bug me to be confident and i am happy for this effect . 
it will , however , speak to a few people , including the parents all thought i went to random phase action should be held off until it is clear the same serious problem . 
the best thing to wonder who is doing so . 
it spoke to the doctor , and you see the anxiety pills could be taken off the counter edge . from what ? 
see ? i can speak with counsel . 
? or should i take advice from people close around me anxiety eyes until i just became an anxiety problem . 
it should not start with trying to keep an eye on your anxiety because the eye makes me more and more likely to panic the demise of circle well there . 
i recommend that you try to focus on something that is guaranteed to make you smile or feel more happy . as soon as you start to feel a bit of a panic , anything . 
or get a friend made you laugh when you start , you feel the panic . if you cannot do that . it worked for me , and had suffered panic attacks , random lol . 
started in a tiny really start worrying but not severe than you do from things just sound . 
i have found that talking about things helps make you anxious just to someone else . 
but i find things i mentioned , and i worry , mum , i see people react to the situation with calm . i should react to make me feel better , because i know what the deal is not a big thing , and i do not need what i was anxious , perhaps not moaning that way . 
however , go to the doctor if it was worse . 
i have people who suffer severe anxiety . to prevent what might leave the house and do the things that could go wrong is so worried about friends . 
doctors give the medication and good for her . she made the best and much more .
