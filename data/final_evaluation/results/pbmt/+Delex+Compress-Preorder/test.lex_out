the thread starter resolute support , i reply , and composed the poem 
pledging to fight to defend the island , and related to the death .
a fishing boat fleet bump japan ghosts stirred up evil little unrest is in trouble , and they show their appearance wolfish again . with a heart and a thief arrogance form .
do not go back to that time when we appeared humiliated when we signed a strong back and an ever shining sharp buried the enemy approached .
the 11 2010 .
bump up resolutely thread started . i agree with the analysis that i like . i am , in order to protect our homes , and our homeland defense , spread the prestige of our china pledging to fight to defend the dignity of our nation to the degree that i died , if it came the real war .
i wish i was born during the passionate long march in the upsurge of the purposes that i lost my head and shed my blood enemy china extinguishing all wrong , completely . spread the prestige our of dragon very much .
how long would we tolerate
according to fellow citizens . 
hello , everyone . i would , however , another incident at sea japan plans another in the sea . people like me . we all know now again premeditate september 18th .
japan defy the whole world condemned the country on the strength of a surprise invasion of the territory of our country from the sacred diaoyu islands open .
china diaoyu islands belong , as we all know , has always been a history , a reason to become our belongings , the original controversy .
our thing , and our thing is why my fellow citizens need to negotiate because they want to go even further to create a fact of occupation . can we allow this ? absolutely not .
i said that militarism will bring grave disaster to the people of japan asia fellow citizens .
especially china ravage suffered several decades . for a long time .
the experimental unit 731 china people living there , and the people who live in other countries korea live human body extremely cruel , brutal methods in northeast nanjing massacre added layers of the blood will never fade away in the ancient capital city , barely , and a big , bloody battle in changsha hengyang and the bones of the dead , over km kill off everything .
saying too many instances of heinous crimes committed in a record china by how difficult is not exhausted all the bamboo strips , citing fellow citizens .
like the wandering souls of those deceased and 10 million lost over the life of the soul , the soul will find peace pacific ocean rest just difficult .
remember all that experience in the era of the era still vividly cries , and the younger generation , even our tears stream down our cheek , also in our blood boiled with indignation when we turn the page and read any history of this page . 
because he wants to reverse the verdict of history , its aggression now , actually wanted to wake up fellow citizens and china
we must we go we face them , despite the pain , we were looking at this year , it would be a shame to back . we have to create a choice , history , history . do not resolve the history issue .
because of the responsibility . we are not afraid . they are related , however , with the small matter of dignity , the territory is to guarantee the interests of national unity and honor , regardless of how to change the clouds , wind , and we could not let the separated from our native land , land , land , despite the scar was wounded . 
as i said , it means the advent 21 century , a time when the gulf press beset , but difficulties inside and outside nations . many things are faced with the challenge of fellow citizens .
we should go for taiwan tibet issue issue or issues surrounding environment south china sea aggressive foreign forces to china in what ways ?
fellow citizens , i have to do what you please and look on the world map and suppress the encirclement and crescent - shaped breath encirclement is strangling our development , our national territorial encirclement is coveted . 
never fear , though . we do not want to make an enemy . however , we are not afraid of us . we do not want war . 
we must strengthen the arms was arranged , and us military forces on the land , air and sea , and all of the urgency . 
however , does not have the ambition of the territory of the ever expanding outward america nations several times to flourish 1 thousand .
because it was not imposed what they want . there is no other foreign security strategy , we follow the philosophy that the application of benevolence and virtue . 
like tolerance and the liberalness of the liberalness tolerance and individual countries . however , we must insist that we are not going to hurt us , to avoid hurting others . 
certainly not fear and tolerance must not be sincerity is cowardice 
serving china exemption to repair the war because of the benevolence for peace .
i said a condensed history of nations is to strive to improve the nation continue to fellow citizens .
the magnificent represents a sacred , solemn posturing is expected to be a peace . 
the scenes have sprung up , many of the heroic tragic agitated about spears and horses . stir the shining armor , in my mind . my memory is a string of occasional thoughts . 
things go , i think that the history is like the yellow pages to see and to contemplate how to achieve a unified the territory alone . his audience hall 100 ago . the rule of the emperor to the famous generation also wandering the great hall alone , in the dark , union integrity . think of the former president .
forget is dangerous , but war is certainly peaceful . in the world according to me , though , must not exercise forbearance ever . all we want is peace , development and fellow citizens , aggravated betrayed and humiliated nation is poor and backward country is falling behind the bully in modern times , lead
what if peace comes from strength , not 
we must , we will focus on education and national defense . we will build up a great wall . in the hearts of people . we have to establish a full - range system , capable of attacking and defense system . a national defense system .
should strengthen the forces engaged in the attack and forced the ultra long range combat capabilities can improve at all . there is a great distance between a great deep in the aerospace and defense industry investment and increase industrial construction , accelerating the modernization of military equipment , and internationalize the high - tech elite division established the premise of high quality to avoid influencing the development of the national economy , the attack would be the best defense . 
horn was about to sound , and the battle is already fully equipped , ready to go . 
but we will accomplish nothing . we are not powerful , with the support of all of us , to support us . 
during this time , we say no to others . my fellow citizens , so we have to , we have achieved . 
1 ) , and to establish a fund to guarantee the work environment , improve the working mechanism , the recruitment of hundreds of thousands of professionals who emigrated from around the world and back to linger china information technology .
to create a second aircraft carrier battle group , is one of the few nuclear powers . 
three manufacturing 5 thousand various kinds of advanced combat aircraft .
4 ) to accelerate the research and of the high - speed ballistic missiles of intercontinental range , more than the nautical mile break may have a missile to deploy a missile defense system .
( 5 ) to resume the nuclear experiment to establish a military force in space . 
( 6 ) and retain 1 thousand nuclear bombs 10 million tons of tnt to install nuclear warheads on missiles and short - range missiles in the middle range , while all need to be installed .
7 30 nuclear submarines , a strategy that would retain the ability to strike the enemy to inflict 3 nuclear devastation .
8 ) abandoned the commitment not to use nuclear weapons first . 
9 preempt retained the right to strike at the threat to national security . 
can strive for . if we are strong and we are confident we will improve my fellow citizens . only we , the unification qin shi huang taiwan recovery . we must carry on far insight , is willing to see a strong and our predecessors , we are responsible .
shaking a piece of land and the motherland , embrace a far piece that tremble moaning to carry what is now called the general wish not to fulfill the forward previously courageous move forward . fellow citizens . 
simmer heaviness and anger in my heart when i read history into concerns me . however , i am willing and i served our country . volunteers for prosperity and is a splendid motherland . once again , there is no regret even if i die , i was born and to the common people , the cloth gown is adequate to show a sincere heart , my patriotic heaven . 
here , i composed a poem in the form of ci classical voice . my heart to aspire to .
lips painted a deep red . 
diaoyu islands protection .
we have lost our bitter .
could be allowed to fall on how the other countries .
years of vicissitude
smoking and chasing a cloud wave that flight . 
the youth is still tender , the youngest brother . 
seal bears wander and all directions . 
look into the flag . 
brandishing weapons , and we have our cross to the east . 
let me drink pacific ocean .
the 26 2002 .
the title of the article , the book and the other for the compatriots , i had a dream to build a museum or memorial temple needed national hero china . how long it will tolerate begging , however , is not expected to ever more of the history of the game . if we forget , hardship , hardship of the people i was history , nations and cultures . the only country that can state 1 declined to overdevelop ? or as a sport for the wealthy countries and strong people , officials and the wealthy to the poor to shut their mouths , ren zhiqiang , disgusting , housing prices , hateful people can pity google said the company does not have the right to remark is not responsible for how long us japan deserves to be presented against a strong bomb bouquets ban ki-moon in strong hiroshima my brothers and my sisters , we need to be ? the star entertainment , or low levels of innovation , technology , talent , please let it be written , let the li yinhe garbage is nothing to be ashamed of in contemporary times off the children .
why not our little fight .
what is still tolerated .
they ride , even in our heads . 
person was doing ? this is still the guts .
we should tell the other could not be bullied at will in such a way that the whole world .
it is time that we showed we are strong china calm too long .
is the carefree life of our citizens . currently , all officials are too extravagant , too . 
we had no cohesion now need to start the war already is a slap in the face of the country following the rear of united states harshly .
let them know that there is no panacea could increase the influence . if we win , to improve the cohesion and the citizens , we could clean out competent bureaucrats not to make us the trash get out if we lose and let china has updated and new blood china gets up .
to go .
i would suggest that a strengthened and guard diaoyu islands island guard every day to protect the fishermen and the sovereignty of our country , we fought the war to defend us . if the small - scale how japan dare to invade our territory by military force , no matter what the cost might not lose china .
but in life , we need to show it is really showing you embrace .
just as i was passing by 
the whole of society , this is like a star , 
not sexy , damn . 
the total might not accept it . 
entertainer agreed to cheap , just as they were in a feudal sense what china somewhat .
look , they live on a glorious 
the group 9 profession .
life is hard . 
shocked . 
that was normal and the heartless whore is righteous , not always a performer . 
they want money , but they do not want to face . 
look for wolves near ms. glasses fans . you know , actors have to drink with him . if it is not forced or out , not even framed . 
son of a bitch . 
ok , as long as something to eat loveliness 
no one is easy . you have to look like a live show . the script , you have to know how to perform 
somebody is all . 
people who score top imperial examination 360 all walks of life behind the scoring efforts and endeavor . people are so on top of the humiliation . this is the word imperial examination bean vermicelli
haha . 
overdo 
reality . 
a shot that hooligans . 
cheap performer . 
cheap performer . 
the entertainment circle dirty birds and beasts that all men are scum it . 
the female star is not easy . that is a pity , but who is to blame them . 
everybody is doing this . how can you make money . if you do not do this . 
women are proud of . but when i was at the front of a woman , the other woman is a melancholy mood when they stay alone . 
prostitution , people are just as popular in ancient time , the star is plainly put on people nowadays , because they are famous , prostitutes should be normal now or they drink with high officials , they are sleeping , some of the officials even just 
just stop talking and other behavior . 
what we should be doing in the future is the ability to alone will not be enough to succeed in the face of us ? such hard choices , too . 
disguise suffered more . look at the glorious is indisputable . 
because they played in a circle , they are just out to see out of the mind . it is not so bad . 
zhang jizhong , the old guy , but the behavior of the hooligans in a virtuous circle of guys think the guy is a talent , not to make a tv series . also , when you have a guy who has done nothing for the people of the whole country wreck . 
both take the needs of both . 
you can have a purely innocent girl , what time it is ?
the story was very shocked the entertainment world now , rumored to be on the force and out because he refused to drink with the guests . people must be arranged to switch to his work , and to assist the government in order to make ends meet , the lawyer instead .
he encountered the super star much envy and social engagements or the circumstances , but the people are not welcome to join or often . 
because they must be to do with many aspects and may not be in the interests of the many , many decisions , after all . 
not could simply be a very normal dinner parties , we seem to be ordinary people . for people like that star and sometimes imagine . 
the stars will have a contract and a lot of roll the money source if they tackle well , people have been forced out or come to frame her heel tack , even if she is not well . 
1 kind of held , and that is always a very , very high integrity . such an invitation to reject stern all stars , the female is a kind of smart .
2 kind of good plays and trick to achieve their objective by their seed money .
rumors . some have even won the super stars 1 role of female in this way .
people who might have had a chance . and the ads , the sponsors of the show lies in the shoulders or chin , feel part of the star female , female , female , drink alcohol , kissing a cheek after some of the most enduring attitude will be adopted . 
the very people they are lower 9 profession .
the stars are just pretending and that living the life of a damn ! actually , much better than this . 
entertainer agreed to cheap , just as they were in a feudal sense what china somewhat .
agreed . 
not easy . oh well , actress 
they deserve it . they asked for that . 
dawn was nothing easy for me . 
the birds and the beasts and bad women are better than men . the birds and beasts

not long , it will take it . 
the highway open route 288 who ran around new richmond quadrant of the southwestern region late 2004 circumference urban
it has changed and developed a pattern of worsening congestion because the pattern , it has caused around its exit localized traffic already . 
the impact of the road told tale huguenot powhatan county trail today .
jones is willing to double traffic reports in a section of the huguenot trail . since more than open .
the surge to speeding and accidents as well . 
a report on the accident . 17 winterfield intersection near the road , up from 12 in all accidents so far this year .
dale virginia department of transportation totten noted engineers 4 lane road residents if they had more money , about $ 13 million
having no money for road construction in the region richmond , of course ) .
because they spend all their money 288 frigging because politicians and people to boost the local .
what is when you need people .
this is a major moment , doh 
route 288 generated residential development in the area around the exit , scarcely populated part of the road , and all the local roads we overtax predicted .
others , however , choose a location where people work and live in a location where they can relieve limited access highways , drivers , traffic between the county chesterfield county goochland county . back and forth .
they created congestion and a new place . 
i was surprised by how rapidly this would only 
i think i can lag a year or even a year .
liable to think created all the exits of the sunni route 288 was created because of the construction of the road . the cost , $ 1 exit just this already .
another predictions 
there was a need for improvements in roads , after soaring to a new subdivision development and approval of commercial projects scattered mega 288 major roads intersect in a few more years .
as we can see , the liability to zoom through the fund , not the dollar . in the past , take highway originally built well before the end of the decade , as well .
brainiac said he thought it was such a great idea .
thanks for nothing . 
i can think of , we spend $ 1 elsewhere , the better .
i think you should not be blamed ( for those of you who created
what is the alternative , if they have enough traffic congestion created them in a new place , new 
whether the congestion in the old place , the additional traffic . 
you have to understand what it feels like now tmt
i took my position on the road . usually a favor . 
excess , but there definitely is with a glaring need in what part of the other states .
traffic has virtually not .
during rush hours in the last minutes .
given the beltway and , through them , a large rural areas . 
the road to nowhere . 
think they can spend to improve facilities , or another potomac crossed the road in desperate need for money . just this .
so , as i said , the rest of the state to help pay for the rest of the budget deal during the last year . adding insult to injury , wiping out virginia centrist to pay the debt .
all of you . we were very nice to oblige . 
however , not much sense . 
it was the same old problem . 
in the sprawling you accuse you , so if you need to get ahead . 
claiming that you will not be able to pave your way out of congestion . if you build an acute need is already in place . 
anonymous 
that is a fair point . 
5:26 makes a good point . 
hammer , but in this situation , the validity of the report , the state audit found ctb and funding for transportation projects based on the best lobbyists . instead of funding is based on a comprehensive transportation plan into the state and into the home .
i submit that this is a situation that should not be tolerated a disgrace . 
pour , and the senator and his toady more money for this flawed institutions because this is worse .
what is an expense for transport . 
it and the benefit plans to private businesses . it does not serve the public interest virginia .
all of you are dead wrong . 
no less state money was intended to pay for economic development from 288 .
come on . 
as i said , i do not understand their tmt points . 
you are stuck in traffic . when the last time when it was not or some sort of business from the business . 
the road will facilitate seems to be in the public interest for the public to get into private business and the public will get from the whole business to me . 
and despite the overwhelming support for the need to drive sunday . the trip . the location of his grandmother , a soccer game , of course . 
no wonder the congestion problem suffered because they did not match the expenditures . the road is what we of business or increase domestic products in the state . 
what should be done if 2 we recognized the benefits of the road , the primary business .
to pay for that , and , of course , is what we passed our bills . as an incentive to locate more transportation business , business , business , business in the least stress on the system , even if it means to locate more travel overall . 
it is hard to understand why so . 
to solve the human settlement patterns and balance function . the capacity of the transport system and land use will generate demand for travel . 
spin . all else . 
emr 
tmt said it and the benefit plans to private businesses . it does not serve the public interest virginia .
i see no point of this statement appears to demonize and plans to put the interest of the public . private business above all else . 
i think they are intertwined , because they are virtually the same tight 
a local problem , obviously , is a lumpy , so the dough . these cookies 
however , we found that we all work for the devil . as in , if we would eventually aggregate to demonize business long enough . 
i see no solution to claim the balance with nature , the dynamics change . ever . 
you see , even into the rail on the center job is positive because demand for bidirectional , promoting the airport rail .
i agree . 
the reason may be sufficient to build it . that is , in fact , all on their own . 
i say exactly the same logic should apply to all of the roads . 
in the end , they should have to use the destination for both maximum investments of us . 
we need more places in order to get us close to the balance we need to be better , you said . 
here is a reality check . 
i drove past . watkins landing morning and evening . 
i commuted to a location where i work toward the back and forth . huguenot trail . 
i have not seen anything like the remote flooded the trafficking ever . 
it zone speed-quantity 75 per 100 cars in the morning for what
plans to widen a huguenot already trail , and because of the heavy demand for development in the new school chesterfield side thing , a whole bunch of development zones exist 1 ago robious funneled through road .
the road is a wonderful that we actually used the road instead of the bottleneck , lacking roads , county and west of powhatan chesterfield .
we can develop commercial and we can work on in close to better our lives . 
you might think of rational use of land that is not 
desire , i do not live in any cities . 
i refused . i worked in the downtown area . 
i refuse to use mass transit , a female not safe work while commuting to work long , irregular hours . 
it happened to , and i would like to develop a large lot . 
i do not understand how to keep a horse in the lot . 14 acres that were supposed to be , exactly ?
a gallon of gas could go 1 dollars .
pay and still alive . 
many people prefer hunting horses and garden certain types of legitimate small businesses do not want to make a living in the urban core . 
infatuation baffled about living in this city . i am truly 
every country has the right to live in anonymous if they wish to live , 6:37 
however , you do not have the right to underwrite the rest of the construction of the highway will cost the state $ ease of shopping and getting the best work . more
what else was overlooked consistently spent $ 288 debates .
congestion can alleviate much of the traffic . if you apply the money for road projects or other press . the road project would not even be forbidden . 
according to the comments by directing me to the investors , and lobbied for a place near the road . the road system , property owners , not competence , funding requests . no matter what , this is a link or a master transportation plan is linked to lack of ray hyde 
i and the year - old mother .
i broke up with my father and son since august
i wanted to start dating , and others , i say that the father and son . if it has to do with people who have nothing to date . 
but the very possessive and he was very controlling . he does not have the right , because we were together 
and there is too much going on in his life right now . we have to work even though he thinks he can . i told him that i did not love him , and i did not love him several times . 
i want him there for his son , he does not need me , too . 
however , he had no one in the family . he did not get along , and it had a family issue . 
i do not want anymore . i was miserable . i was more miserable . if he had been around longer . 
i do not want him there for his son , not because of the good fathers , or try to , at least . 
i believe every child needs for both parents and children , even though the people were together , or are not together . 
he thinks he can , but no one had me if he can not have me . 
what do i do ? i moved my life . 
bad ex used to threaten the very son . 
must not give in to that , because it just escalated . if you give in to that . 
you are right , you have to live your life , you are happy because you cannot cave . because of the threat posed by him . 
but , regardless of if he would love to see one of his sons , really . just a typical method of control . this is used to like him . 
other people said things like to kill me if i left you through it ? 
dates 
to meet all kinds of people . 
do what you want . 
you would be better off with him , you have no price would probably be better if he walks out of your life . both the volunteer . 
i agree . the other was that he is not in the business of you dating or not dating you .
i do not tell him . 
but not because of the threat posed by him because he was not concerned about his personal life . for you . 
whether you can document the threat posed by him . 
you really need . 
quit , and you have to take his call , made to leave voice mail 
make your email or text you . 
to keep those records 
to get a lawyer , and the divorce . 
trying to legal aid . if they cannot afford one . 
tell all the communications lawyers needed to go through your ex 
and there are people who want to drive the bus , people who till the food is delivered to your exact change . 
she was not aware of them ? you are not going to get a pile of change from the bank . 
wyoming ? take note somewhere . 
people get lazy . 
i liked the most was near me nearly as possible . i do not like to count the copper , all day . 
they told you just got lazy , because they are taking note of the hell out of the bus .
it is not legal to pay a certain amount of loads of coin , for example , you could pay something like 30 1 pence pence only .
hello , but when i start university september not gel obviously most immediately .
i know , i have adjusted , however , to take some time . i was very shy introvert , and is especially anxious , always , to all the rest . 
go out and all , and my housemate 1 night i was here . it is hard to go out than what the best i have ever had to do .
i went to the bar , the student union on their own . when i was sober 
here is a fact . but more to the point , 
i did not enjoy . after i was here about a month , and i am not disillusioned . i enjoy setting project . i do not like to deliver much of the course .
the university make out much better than seems to have it . 
i started 1 term bad student financial delays and added to the stress level , i am so worried , not because of the progress of work because all the piles of conclusion .
the people i assigned counsel and the university to see about 6 weeks blocked session not to work out to see if it would not open up really ever an honest opinion .
only half the heart . 
i loaded and work now on what i have to hit a major deadline for the neck , and as a result i feel depressed and miserable all the time . 
i have no longer , and so can you have only so many sessions at a time . i doubt it will have much help this time . if there is no help . i have already . 
i lack motivation , and i do not feel comfortable with me as a person , but i feel i want to lecture i gave in , could not be brought about because they ended up giving the job to end with someone to aspire to . i was dead . 
i would rather die and education and i do not live the life i live . i want the matter worse by dropping out . 
i am , and i turned from year to year . this year , i did not have much time left to fail . i must do something .
i do not want to go through the system , and i have consistently failed and i have failed over and over to the college . once they do , i can get another course . 
possible ? please . i have some advice . 
go and see a doctor , and you can see that in the way ? how to get your deadline extension to try to ease the pressure a bit , you can 
this post is similar to the one sent to and from your tutor to consider mitigating circumstances . not to worry , they all saw what ( including some admitted . not comfortable . much , much , much , much worse before . i know that because he used to work for the department of administration . 
what broke the chunk could have managed to work . 
a bit of concentrated work assignment of most urgently 1 time . obviously , at a time .
shut-off housemate and not well done . so is a new thing . from the very beginning to try to keep it now . 
i recommend that you go see your doctor . you would , too . 
speech could benefit if you are always anxious to get a friend to a normal therapy because it was really because of anxiety .
i am sure you will allow the university to be honest and trying to get the deadline extended . 
to get , and keep , keep the strength to carry on the hard living . 
the divorce of my mum and she had a horrible time with my stepfather was sent by her . she found a new round of her to bend 
she is . she has epilepsy and manic depression , with the anger there is a huge problem . 
the horrible for me . she is constantly . 
unable to cope with her outburst and that her remarks were hateful nasty . while i was at home . 
% bursary people full time students in private schools . high pressure in the form of 6 years old i was a breaking point .
i have not been able to work at home , because she shouts at me . 
i was angered by the teachers since then . 
she is lovely , and in one minute , like a mummy , i have my back . she turned into the most spiteful living humans . then , in the next minute . 
i have not come to pass . and with all of my exam , and i have to accept the defeat . this year , make it part of my life i was already failed . 
maybe i can come back from this offer . who knows ? but it is one of the most amazing , i could not accept even offered to make the grade , not that i ever was . 
i wish she could have wiped from my life . things are good , best and so much worse without her . 
but i think the selfish , just as i was then . 
however , that does not mean that i have lived like this for sure . 
it should be better , it is good to the degree that so much . 
but i feel like i have no control over the downhill spiral towards this . 
i do not know what to do . 
thank you for reading . 
nice vented . 
she could not get a section of that . 
she had a history of mental illness or even diagnose 
you did not know you are not going to get a good grade for sure . because of the acceptance of the place ( if it can be accepted . 
what life throws at you all the time . 
outsiders , if not someone is part of your family . 
must deal with , and my dad was a verbal abuse . before long , i came because of the year , the only way out is the only reason i was here is that it is honest .
if you want a really hard - working out . 
sounds like you need your support from somewhere else . if she could not give a real consistent . 
maybe ? or something similar called the organization .
you can go to the library and on saturday the library to study for hours . good .
whether you can go to your house , friends formed a study group . 
because of pain and a bit of an arse wyoming blamed for all the problems of the y ? you want a section of her . 
i know what you feel . 
spit my mum from hell , too . 
i should be high to take up smoking . 
tsr grew up to stop the nag , and oh , it was a joke . 
i think i became weak , and much more . in the past year to year . my personality is trying to dull down some friends at the university , is the way it is in between .
a nice lead over people , but you can believe that people are saying , or whatever the hell out of people . i want to do whatever to me . 
they show absolutely no respect for them . 
but , as i said , for example , and hello , someone i ignore someone decided that someone wants to help me . some of the best work in the late minutes to give more to help someone .
it has caused and the anger . in life , and a lot of my distress in life , it started to affect my concentration in the university , really . 
anyone ? get a handle or experience for this sort of thing has some way to go to gain respect any again . 
just said . 
if you do it gradually , it is not particularly comfortable . 
you can start with is not sorry , but i was busy . 
you do not go to the top over with it , of course . you do not go in the direction of a complete opposite direction . 
if you think the mind of america said . 
they have started to respect them more when they are starting to realize that you are not bending over backwards for them . 
is this really such a bad attitude , well , nice . nice , but you can respect you , do not let them do anything to them , just as you do , of course . but that is not a nice person . that is a fool . 
but i do not know anyone ? read this . and i just , i had been conscious of a feeling of desperation . i feel like i need to tell someone . 
i left home and when i start september from university . but i was anxious about the delay . i would have done this . this is incredible . i think until i got here . now here i am , and i have been here for over a week . i feel overwhelmed and it all feel terribly intelligent , and i am not socially awkward .
i have struggled with emotional and despite the fact that the majority of my life . i lost my dad . i was around for years . i blamed the loss on what i always felt since i moved to secondary school 9 i counsel . i had a period when i lived in december this year around march roughly months long .
i feel similarly overwhelmed . and part of the problem is i live not credible . i made , but i doubt that there will always be low self esteem ever more of me at the moment . not being able to concentrate and to find work . i became very quiet social occasion as i often do , i doubt about anything and everything . 
but nothing was diagnosed with depression , i would counsel , i suggest not suffer depression to me . i worry that my dad died . so there is a huge depression caused his suicide .
and i was trying to solve my problem . i have found useful as before . in particular , the exercise and meditation , try things like books and tapes , self help . help also . but i feel that i live ? this is a general waste a chance . i had a chance , and i was one of the young men is the one to beat this feeling away at me . 
and i do not know what i do is simple . i am not follow-through copyright trade . when i think of things i have ever done , friends said , and i am often lazy , there can be no disagreement at the time . a lot of things . i feel like everything is trying to do for anyone to help their time could fail again . 
and i am sorry for anyone reading this jumble mess . but i feel like me . people who seek a bit of moaning , i had been conscious of a feeling of desperation . the true self . 
it is common for people to become feelings in people , the existence of a more intense when it is a new situation , and to feel the pressure and socializing with strangers to fit the new roles , such as students . 
no professional and i am healthy i can speak from personal experience , because i was the only one , i suggest you see a qualified health professional about things , and you worry about depression you feel strong . 
most people feel intelligent and people are not awkward . when they got to university 1 . because you are not alone . at the university , but definitely i would recommend that you get counseling service appointment . you , in your university . it really does not matter if you tell the depression or depression last year last year , you really do not . and , obviously , when you have some problems . the minute you can use some of the support is not important compared to what you will experience is helpful label really meditate and exercise . are you trying to do , but because you have to engage , but to help the general life to get somewhere and not beat up because they feel they have no motivation to do anything in minutes . and a lot of people feel that things like this pass , hoping things at the beginning , you feel kind of more y8 well with you , not only do you feel worse and you kind of get some help .
good luck . 
i think i feel a lot more , but you feel the same way . by using the medications people , friends , is not a solution . as such , but ( b ) is a good friend , you will probably be around when you were depressed , would be better than being alone and depressed . if you definitely feel free to chat with fancy private message either way . 
i focused on . if i was your idol you aspire to someone such as someone who came from a bad background , someone is going to end up with someone who has a successful and a happy marriage , family , etc. however , you do not want them . you would have to be someone you admire , you respect . 
if you focus on the achievements in life . you are not a statement of your studies , or why . indeed , the study , because you want to ? because he wanted to experience the y4 mum ? did you go to ? you need a degree for career you want . 
in sum , and why you are there your bottom off to work . to get the best grades , so you can have something that you can say , such as not a failure and , hey , it worked hard to pass , and when you get a degree either way .

but can i have the signs of something in the autism spectrum who do not have what is , or what the signal as well as signal 1 2
the guy , you know what i mean . 
the symptoms of autism is able to walk on their toes . 
can a brain tumor symptom is headache 
could be symptomatic of leukaemia , tired and felt a lot of times . 
the symptoms , however , did not apply , there will always be worth it if a lot of cases , the symptoms noted in this instance because of the clear . nothing has ever been diagnosed , if not noted . 
but i walked on my toes because i was born with a strange toes curl under straighten with the surgery years ago must walk .
but my brother is autistic , but i have not noticed either autistic spectrum so broad and i was probably a mild and because i have a communication problem i have not picked up the reaction / body language society .
however , i did not have the proper thing to have . even some of the symptoms , that does not mean that you have to have a certain conditions can then . 
so tell not walking on my toes . i 1 . i walked on my toes . not much .
i have a dyspraxia 
dyspraxic may or may have the tendon is so short . 
drilling for the people doing the dance / etc. on it . i found it more comfortable now . 
i have not read into random symptoms like that . too much . 
hello , old girl . years of age 13 after days . i was addicted to harm self .
i started with the scissors , i slit a finger on each individual . in my years , i never stopped . from that day .
it is worse because i have a scar on my leg because i slit legs . one of the staples of my ex boyfriend named did not stop . if you cut me , i bleed 
i have a slit in my arm several times . 
they have to heal and i cut from staples and i robbed a razor , then the school . 
i take it and other drug paracetamol and around 5 i take with lager and vodka could not find cuts . 
i was tempted to cut me , or for my arms , i burned really as i write this . 
i am addicted to cut again when healed one . 
i think of it every day .
for years , and i am sick of my life already .
source : i leave . and the years do not want anymore . i know this .
he cares for his little girl , and his new wife . he got a new life , where i just did not want . 
my mates dead . i had the best of years .
my relationship with the boys , and the year - old boy was forbidden to speak to me . and because of the age difference .
and mum , i also suffer from depression have
i do not want to stop me . 
i do not care what they have done to me . i want to do things that once again and again . i was tortured . i hate me . 
however , my love and my best mate load means the world to me . if he did do anything . 
i have not told him . but he found out . 
i do not want to hurt him . i did not want to hurt him . 
what do i do ? 
thanks for reading . 
you ? or on any of the drugs . the drug will get any therapy . 
should talk to your school nurse or your gp told or what was going on . 
can you trust the people you can tell schools to teach 
you can help if you told people . 
it is only likely to get worse . if you keep it bottle-up inside . 
i trust that these things do get good . the earliest as possible instead of letting things get worse and even worse 
can you please do not do this . 
but i was at the start of the year and self harm is to cut my arms last year , mainly to stop the harm in a few months ago .
it is hard , but you can do it . 
but i feel so much more and i was happy to see the scar to remind me , and what i feel so strong at that time because i want to do such a thing to me . my pain . 
also , strong and you can do it . i found that to keep a journal , writing poetry and salvation 
addictive but you can overcome the harm to harm self . 
remember self harm does not define who you are 
it can be overcome . 
because of the check , that i find things i always belong to the government , or to ensure that i have not lost anything . i have not left anything . every time i go out in the direction of the university , especially in the past year . i think i got a form of so .
second , i have to , and i often check 1 go check could not resist after 30 seconds . then again , for some reason .
why is this . 
me ? or something . 
it is , and most often , when many things to carry it , carry it . but what is rare , they check every day . still , even many of the diseases that ocd ? this is the extent of any
what can i do with this ? 
however , i get very anxious sort of go away . after a minute , if i did not check 30 much anxiety because i could not wait that long . often .
i feel i am doomed , or if i lost my wallet , or my phone is doomed to feel . 
i wish i could go out . i am not worried about something that i had to leave or i lost something . just every minute .
i do not know what to do . really , i was afraid i would go into the general practitioner 
and they are not going to hear some compulsion . like this , probably ever . i do not know what i just did . 
whether any of that you have people like ritual 
but i was crazy to think that it would be difficult to get out of this very strange . 
how could you advise me . 
i used to do this . i was on my way to college , and i have a list . i know i have the items on the use of compulsive , i check in the bus . 
i know how easy it is to be better said than done severe anxiety , and i have more now . i think this is a warning sign , so you try and weaned on habits , habits are relatively fresh , just as a visit to the doctor , but you definitely do not keep telling yourself that you check these things also . 
in the worst case , because to see a doctor , much , much , much , much more , is not worried about that . 
i do about :p psychology class today .
the way you can get rid of it is to avoid the act of compulsive . just because you have not checked , and you lose something . it just left . 
gradually , luxury has decreased because of your ocd disappear during the overtime , even though the hoped to increase the level of anxiety for the duration of your
that sounds overly anxious , you are . instead , you have to just really bad about me .
i was very obsessed 1 20 night , got up to check the lock to lock in my house by , of all people , in particular .
i am convinced that they are not locked in . i know that they sometimes lock 
i think it will become a real problem when they start interrupted your routine every day , really
and why would definitely not crazy not to worry , i am sure that you understand the gp issue . 
i went to therapy for other reasons also . i was encouraged to pick numbers , and less than 20 times , obviously . i stuck with the numbers in check , cut down on me . 
and i think the idea of teaching is still okay , i check . or if i am , i check the 20 5 
i have good , better , and so far i think there is a lot of hope that anyone who wants to improve the definite improvement . 
i am pretty calm about it , and usually i like . i take things as they come , i will not worry too much . 
finding and become really anxious , but in the past month to month . i am not talking about a mere felt nervous from the blue .
i began to feel a variety of panic . i did not worry too much beforehand . when it did not cross my mind as something because the ring alarm bells in my head . i even irrational . 
but i am not sure ? or because of a lifestyle change to go from free to students , the graduate is employed to take care of this . this is not a signal for other issues . this was the beginning of the bug . because this is going to effect my confidence and i was happy . 
it will , however , speak to a few people , including parents , all think i go for random phase action should be held off until it is clear . i am serious . the same problem . 
the best thing to wonder who is doing so . 
it spoke to the doctor , and you see the anxiety pills could be taken off the counter edge . from what ? 
see me ? can i speak with counsel . 
or should it ? i take advice from people close around me anxiety eyes until i became just the anxiety problems . 
it should not start with trying to keep an eye on your anxiety , because they make the eyes i have , and the more likely to panic . well , the more the demise of circles there . 
i am , you should try to focus on something that is guaranteed to make you smile or feel more happy . as soon as you start to feel a bit of a panic , anything to you . 
or get a friend made you laugh when you start to panic . if you feel that you have not been able to do that . it worked for me , and had suffered panic attacks , random lol . 
start to start worrying about the really tiny , though not a severe than you do from things just sound . 
to help , i find that talking about the things that make you anxious just to someone else . 
however , i find that the things i mentioned , and i worry , mum , i see people react to the situation with calm . i should react to make me feel better , because i know what the deal is not a big thing , and i do not need the things i am anxious , perhaps not moaning that way . 
if you go to the doctor , but worsen it . 
people who suffer severe anxiety . i have to leave the house , to prevent and to be able to do the things that could go wrong , was so worried about friends . 
doctors give the medication and to make good on her . she was the best and much more .
