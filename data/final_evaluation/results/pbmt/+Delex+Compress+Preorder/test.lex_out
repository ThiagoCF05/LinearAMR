support for people to start a thread resolute , and composed the poem , i reply . 
pledging to fight to defend the island , and the related to the death .
bump boat fishing fleet evil little japan ghosts stirred up trouble and unrest again they show their wolfish appearance with a thief and arrogance in the form of the heart .
never went back to that when we when we signed the humiliation , time appears to be a strong china sharp and shining buried the approach of the enemy .
the 11 2010 .
resolutely bump up . i agree with the analysis , to start a thread if people really come to war , i would like to . i was the best and i die hua mulan in order to pledge to fight to defend the dignity of our nation to protect our home and defending our homeland and the spread of our china prestige .
i very much wish i when long march passionate on the upsurge of mao zedong bear , in order to that , i lost my head . to complete the extinguishing of the enemy . all of china wrong to spread our dragon prestige and shed my blood .
how long would we tolerate a japan
said fellow citizens . 
hello again , everyone , i now japan premeditate plans another incident in the sea . another lugou bridge on the sea like me , though . as we all know , september 18th .
japan defying the whole world with a strong condemnation of the country and opening a surprise invasion of our country sacred territory diaoyu islands .
diaoyu islands has always belonged to the china , as we all know by history . the reason why the government is that we were going to become what the original belong to the controversy .
i this is our thing , our things and why the necessary negotiations . my fellow citizens to go even further , because they want to create facts occupation . this can we allow ? absolutely not .
i say the japan militarism . bring grave disaster to asia people , fellow citizens .
especially china suffers japan ravage as long as several decades .
the human body japan unit 731 cruel experiments . the people who live in other countries , people live and korea china people live extremely brutal methods in northeast nanjing massacre added that never fade away layers of blood into the ancient capital city over 1 thousand kilometer bloody big battles in and hengyang changsha barely part of the dead bone and kill off everything .
said there are too many in a way that is difficult in a manner that is not exhausted all the bamboo strips record cited instances of japan commitment in china fellow citizens in a heinous crime .
just like that , the soul of the deceased lost souls wander over the life and soul of the pacific ocean find difficult to rest in peace .
all experienced that era still vividly remember the era when any of us to turn the page and read the pages of this history , our younger generation also cry , even down to the streams in our cheek , tears and indignation boiled in a way that our blood . 
japan actually wanted to reverse the verdict of the country . the history of the aggression , because now want to wake up on fellow citizens and china asia .
although we we will look back on this year , it would be a shame to the pain we must we go we face them , not to resolve the history issue to create history and choice of history .
responsible , so we are not afraid of a small territory is related to them , as a matter of dignity , though . we could not let the separate our native land , even though a land wounded scar the land and , in the interest of national unity regardless of how to change the wind and clouds to guarantee the honor . 
as i said , for the national 21 century mean the advent a time when difficulties beset the inside and outside of the gulf press , but in the face of many things to challenge fellow citizens .
we go to china aggressive foreign forces . the surrounding environment taiwan issues or tibet issue south china sea issue . in what ways should be .
what do i do , please look to your fellow citizens of the world . maps and encirclement coveted our national territory to suppress the encirclement the crescent - shaped breath and encirclement strangle us development . 
never fear , though . we do not want to make kashmir an enemy that will not be afraid to eastern asia . even though we do not want war . 
we must urgently . we arranged for arms and strengthen all the military forces , in the air , land and sea . 
though never had ambitions of expanding outward territory of america several times , a flourishing national 1 thousand .
not imposed what does not want other foreign security strategy because we followed the application of philosophy and benevolence and virtue . 
like its tolerance and liberalness individual tolerance and liberalness we must insist that we do not hurt , though , to avoid we would hurt the other . 
tolerance is certainly not afraid and not the sincerity of cowardice must be 
china exemption japan war repair world war ii so to serve on the benevolence of peace .
i say peoples heroes monument is a condensed history of nations strive to continue to improve the national fellow citizens .
the magnificent solemn posturing represents a sacred expect peace . 
many have sprung up about the heroic tragic scene shining armor , spears and horses . stir occasionally agitated , in my mind of my memory thoughts string . 
things go , and i think that the history of the yellow pages , like to see kangxi contemplate on how to achieve unification territory alone . his audience hall 100 ago . rules of generation , a famous emperor and abraham lincoln also wandered the dark great hall alone . think of the integrity of the union former u.s. president
forget the wars certainly dangerous , however , is peaceful in the world , i say , must not ever exercise forbearance , though . we want development and peace fellow citizens and humiliation boxer protocol betraying the nation in modern times , the aggravated china is a poor and backward country is falling behind the lead bullied
if it were not for the strength of the coming from , what is the peace . 
we must , we have to focus on education , national defense and we have to build up a part of the great wall in the hearts of the people , we have established the national defense system is the ability for the full range of attack and systems . defense systems .
the best defense , the attack should strengthen the forces engaged could force the ultra long range attacks and to improve . there is a great distance between a great deep combat capabilities in all aerospace premised on to avoid influencing the economy , increasing investment , the development of the national defense industry and construction industry and accelerate the modernization of military equipment and internationalize to establish high quality high - tech division , the elite . 
ready to go about to sound the battle horn and is already fully equipped 
we accomplished nothing in a way that we do not support , but all of us . we supported the powerful . 
a time when we say no , no , the other i do my fellow citizens , so we we must be achieved . 
( 1 ) establish guarantee funds to the recruitment of hundreds of thousands of professionals to emigrate to united states linger and around the world . information technology back to china and improve the work environment working mechanisms .
second , to create a few nuclear power aircraft carrier battle groups . 
3 ) manufacture the 5 thousand various kinds of advanced combat aircraft .
( 4 ) to accelerate research on a range of more than 10 thousand nautical miles of high - speed intercontinental ballistic missiles that could break of a missile defense system and deploy the missiles .
5 resumed nuclear experiment to establish a military force in space . 
6 retain 1 thousand 10 million tons of tnt nuclear bombs and the installation of a nuclear warhead . for all the range of missiles and short - range missiles in the middle need to be installed .
( 7 ) to retain the ability to inflict 30 3 nuclear strike devastated the enemy , a strategic nuclear submarine .
8 abandoned the commitment not to use nuclear weapons first . 
9 ) when a threat to national security retain the right to preempt strikes . 
if we only we can strive to improve , and we are confident that we have the strength of my fellow citizens . the unification of china qin shi huang zheng chenggong taiwan recovery we are responsible , we must carry on with our predecessors have far to see , and a strong willingness to insight
now shaking that tremble far motherland , embrace a piece is a piece of land and moan called carrying in general , previously not fulfill wish things forward . move forward courageous fellow citizens . 
when i read history . my heart simmer heaviness and anger into a concern to me , though . i am willing to volunteer to serve on our country in order to prosper , and that is our motherland . once again , there is a splendid and not regret even if i die , i was born to the cloth gown and common people . the show is my patriotic sincere heart adequate heaven . 
here , the way the ci composed a poem of classical form . i voice my heart to aspire to .
to paint the deep red lips 
protect diaoyu islands .
we have lost our ryukyu islands bitter .
how can you be allowed to fall as the other countries .
for the year , vicissitude
smoke and flying wave clouds chase . 
the youngest brother is still tender youth . 
wander all directions and bear a seal 
looking over the flag 
brandishing us our weapons and cross to the east .

the 26 2002 .
the title . the other article , i have a dream , a book for taiwan compatriots how long tolerated it never beg olympics , though , is expected to be a game . if we forget history , the history of hardship , hardship , more people . i was the only nations and 1 afghan culture , can a sport when overdevelop declined to state the wealthy countries and the strength of the people or the wealthy . the official and the poor ? disgusting . ren zhiqiang shut their mouths , hateful housing prices can pity people google said the company does not have the right to remark is not responsible for how long us japan deserves to be strongly opposed to the bombing ban ki-moon hiroshima presented bouquets in the strength of my brother . my sister , we need stars , low level of entertainment or innovation , technology , talent ? not in contemporary times li yinhe wrote the garbage , it would be a shame to let it get off , please children ! and the need to build a memorial museum or china temple a national hero
so why do we not fight a little japan .
what china is still tolerated .
they even riding in our heads . 
china gut the people still doing this ?
we will tell the whole world that it is not possible to others by bullying china at will , as it should be .
the time when we will show we are strong too long calm china .
is that all of our citizens lives . currently , the officials are too extravagant is carefree , too . 
we do not already have a cohesion now need to start the war , the harsh slap in the face of the government following the rear of united states country .
let them know us is not a panacea . if we win the may increase china influence and improve citizens cohesion if we lost , we could clean out the incompetence of bureaucrats , and we have to make to get the trash out let china blood and having a new update to get the china up !
to go .
i would suggest that to protect fishermen , and the sovereignty of our country to strengthen the guard china diaoyu islands and for every day . guard the island if japan dare to invade our territory by force , we , the military , no matter what the cost of fighting small - scale how we defend the wars without china can lose .
we need to show that you are in life . but the show really embrace .
i was just passing by 
the stars of people like this in the whole society . 
not sexy , damn . 
the total might not accept it . 
agreed to a cheap just entertainer is somewhat a sense of what they are in the feudal china .
they live look at the glorious 
9 profession group .
a hard life . 
shocked . 
that normal and as always the whore is heartless and not righteous performer . 
they want money , but they do not want to face . 
look at the fan near ms. wolf glasses , you know , if it is not forced out or did not even frame the actors must drink with him . 
son of a bitch . 
loveliness as long as something to eat would be ok . 
easy . no one is like a live show . you look at the script , you have to know how to be performed . 
it will all be somebody 
at the top of the scoring with people from all walks of life . so the top score imperial examination people behind the effort and endeavor to this humiliation , bean vermicelli words .
haha 
overdo 
reality . 
the shooting that hooligans . 
cheap performer . 
cheap performer . 
dirty entertainment circles , that all men are scum , it is the birds and the beasts 
they are to blame , what a pity , but it would not be easy in that the star female 
everybody doing this , how can you make money . if you do not do this , 
a woman when i was at the front of the other women , but women are proud of the melancholy mood when they stay alone . 
prostitution , popular just in ancient times . nowadays , it is the stars put plainly , it is up to the people to be prostitutes . now they are famous people . thus , it is just a normal , they had drunk with some high officials , or should they even sleep with officials . 
just the other behaviors . stop talking . 
what do we do in the future , should be the ability alone is not enough to succeed . we , too , in the face of such a hard choice ? 
the disguise . more suffering . look at the glorious is indisputable . 
they just play where they circle out to see out of mind . so it is not so bad . 
the old zhang jizhong guy behavior of hooligans in the guys circle , also thinks the guy is not talent virtuous , but to make a television series , when guys have done nothing wrecks , the people of the whole country 
both take what both need . 
when can has a purely innocent girl .
now , the story is very shocking to the entertainment world , rumors that force out refused to drink , because the arrangement with guests , and you have to switch people to work , assistant instead , in order to make ends meet , the lawyer .
the stars much envy super people often encounter people not welcome but must join in or social engagement or circumstances . 
there must be many aspects and many of the interest has to do with so many , after all , is not a possible decision . 
for the stars , people are not that simple for us ordinary people it seems very normal parties like the dinner is sometimes able to imagine . 
people have a lot of stars , a contract , and if so , well , it is up to the people to tackle the rolls . the source of the money . if it is , well , she is not tack forced out , or even come to frame her heel 
the stars were the 2 smart female kind that the 1 kind of always hold very high integrity and stern rejected all such invited
good 2 kind to play tricks . and with their seed money to achieve their objective .
rumors of the stars some have even super to win the role of female 1 this way :
after some people can drink alcohol ads , the sponsors of the show , there is a chance that lie in the shoulder . the star female or feel part of the kissing the cheek , chin , female , female , and most people adopt the enduring attitude . 
they are the 9 lower profession very people .
that star is actually just a pretend to be living a much better life than this damn ! 
agreed to a cheap just entertainer is somewhat a sense of what they are in the feudal china .
agreed . 
oh well , it would not be easy actors 
they deserve it . they are going to ask that . 
dawn . to me , nothing is easy . 
birds , beasts and women are worse than the birds and beasts and men .

braawwkkk 
it will take , it will not happen for a long time . 
as late as 2004 open circumference ran around the southwest quadrant of the richmond route 288 highway , a new urban regions .
already , is it going to change development patterns that a worsening pattern of cause and it caused localized traffic congestion around its exit . 
today , the tale told by richmond times-dispatch huguenot powhatan county trail , the impact on the road .
willing to jones reported traffic has more than doubled . in a section of the huguenot trail . since the open .
the surge to the speed and the accident as well . 
so far this year reported that 17 winterfield road near the intersection of the accident , up from 12 accident . when all the 2004 .
virginia department of transportation residents engineer dale totten noted that if they had more money , about $ 13 million 4 lane road .
of course , does not have the money for the construction of a road in the region .
to spend all its money frigging 288 , local politicians and people because of a boost to government .
when you need people . where are the
this is a major moment , doh 
we predict that generated a residential development in the scarcely populated areas all around the exit of the road , and overtax a local road .
other choice location where people work and live in , but a location where people will be able to limit access to the highway traffic relief driver back and forth between chesterfield county and the county .
the congestion , and they had to create a new place . 
the only surprise me how this rapidly . 
even , i think i may lag 3 or 4 years
think of the exit is liable for creating all sunni route 288 has already created a cost of 13 million dollars . the construction of the road because this is just 1 exit .
another predictions 
soaring need new to improve the road after more scattered a few years to develop a subdivision and approved the mega commercial 288 intersect , a major road project .
well , we could see the zoom . not to fund the liabilities . well , the original built highways takes dollars . in the past , when before the end of the decade .
said brainiac think route 288 is such a great idea .
thanks for nothing . 
i think we can be better spent elsewhere . 400 million dollars .
i think you , you are not to blame for that , people should be created .
who are they if they have enough to create a new traffic congestion in the new place . the alternative . 
additional traffic congestion in the old place ? 
now do you understand things like fairfax tmt feel .
i usually take my position to favor the road . 
but 288 is definitely excess with a glaring need in other things , which is part of the state .
richmond virtually not have traffic .
the last minutes , when the rush hour .
and give them a beltway through large rural areas . 
the road to nowhere . 
just think , you could spend another cross potomac facilities or the desperate need to improve roads in nova this money .
as i said , the rest of the state . the rest will pay for help during the last year , to deal with the budget . to add insult to injury , so i paid virginia centrist wiped out the debt .
very nice . we are obliged to all of you . 
not much sense , though . 
it was the same old problem . 
if you get ahead , you need to be with you because you are accused of sprawling 
if you build in a place already acute need to claim not to you could pave your way out of congestion 
anonymous 
that is a fair point . 
5:26 makes a good point . 
but this is the situation . a hammer valid what state audit report found that instead of on the basis of the funding for the comprehensive plan to transport to a state based on the people who are the best ctb lobby and vdot funding for transportation projects and into the home .
i submit this is a disgrace . the situation should not be tolerated . 
and senator and his toady poured more money for this flawed institution . so this is worse .
what in expenditure on transport of things . 
virginia . it is for the benefit of private businesses plan and it would not serve the public interest .
dead wrong . all of you . 
no less walter stoch stated intent to pay money for economic development . about 288 .
come on . 
as i said , i do not understand their point tmt 
the last time when not are in for some sort of business or come from the business , you are stuck in traffic . 
it seems to me that the whole of the road will facilitate the public interest for the public to get into private businesses and the public to get from the business . 
need support , although , of course , soccer , the game will be driving sunday and trip to the location of the grandmother had been overwhelmed . 
no wonder the suffering the congestion problem cannot be matched by the thing that the road that we have the expense of increased business or the state , because the domestic product . 
if we recognize that the primary road will benefit business 2 thing should be done .
to pay for that , of course , passed a w for a more things for us to bill , transport and the incentive to businesses to locate business in business with the least stressed that even if the system is to locate more overall travel mean business . 
it was so hard to understand . why ? 
a solution to the function of the human settlement patterns and balanced transportation capacity of the system to use land to generate demand for travel . 
spin . all else . 
emr 
tmt , say it will benefit a private business plan and it would not serve the public interest .
i do not see the point of this statement appears to demonize the private business plan , and to put the interest of the public , because above all else . 
i think they are intertwined because they have virtually the same tight 
obviously , this is a local problem . cookies , lumpy , so the dough ) . 
but if we are long enough to demonize business . eventually , we found when we all work for the devil . in the aggregate 
i do not see a solution to the claims , the balance with ever changing the dynamic nature . 
you even see the rail into the positive ( for the airport job . the center is to promote the bidirectional , because the demand for rail .
i agree . 
in fact , that may be , it is built and sufficient reasons , all on their own . 
all i said exactly the same logic applies to the road , as it should be . 
that they should have a destination in both . in the end , for the maximum use of what we invest 
in order to do that we need more places . we are getting closer and closer , you say we need to balance . 
check the reality here . 
i drove watkins landing past the morning and evening . 
i commuted back and forth in the direction to a location where i work huguenot trail . 
i have never seen anything remotely like a flood , traffic . 
it zone speed-quantity 75 per 100 how long in the morning , the car .
already plans to widen the huguenot chesterfield side trail development in heavy demand , and the new school . a whole bunch of zone 1 ago funneled through robious road things because of the existence of the development .
instead , the lack of road powhatan county chesterfield bottleneck in the west , and the wonderful 288 road that we actually use the road .
will we be able to commercial development , and we can work in closer and closer to our lives . 
you may think that is not a rational use of land 
i do not desire to live in any of the city . 
i refused , i worked in the downtown area . 
i refuse to use mass transit not safe . when a female commuting long hours without regular work . work . 
and it happened to , i would like to develop a large lot . 
i do not understand exactly how i keep horses that were supposed to be in a lot of acres .
is it possible to go 1 gallon gas 10 dollars .
and still pays for them to live their life . 
many people prefer the garden a legitimate horse of a certain type of small businesses and to make the hunt , who did not want to live in the urban core . 
i have this infatuation about living in the city . a truly baffled . 
an anonymous 6:37 if they wish to live , have every right to live in the country . 
you do not have the right to the rest of the state underwrite the cost of the construction of the highway , $ easier to shop , and get to work , but
consistently overlooked what else is spent $ 288 debate .
if the application money to other road projects , the press , or even forbid not road projects can alleviate much traffic congestion 
said direct comment to investors that the lobby is one of the places the road near the road people owned property and no competence , regardless of what the system is linked to a master plan to transport or lack links to fund these requests and ray hyde

hello , i started at the university in april , but it was not immediately obvious gel , for the most part .
though i know i will take some time to adjust . i was always very introvert , especially , is anxious and shy . for all the rest . 
all of my housemate and go out on the night of the 1 here i am , and the hardest to go out than what i would ever have to do
sober , i was on my own when i go to the bar , a student union . 
but more to the point , the facts here . 
i did not enjoy . after i was here about 2 and a half months , i did not much like to deliver courses , and i am not disillusioned . i enjoy set the project .
the university make out much better than it seems 
my bad start 1 term pile all of the conclusion of the delayed financially , because the students were added to the stress level , and i am so worried , because there is no work in progress
if an honest opinion . not really work out . see , i never opened up the university to assign the people who counsel and blocking session saw about a week 6 week
only half of the heart . 
i now laden with what is in the works . as a result , neck , depressed and miserable all the time , and i feel i have to hit major deadline 
i have no longer can only so many at a time . you have to have a session of the cause and i doubt much will have to help this time . if i had already was of no help . 
i have a lack of motivation , and i do not feel comfortable with the people i lecture , i feel that i want to , i gave in , but it does not end up . in the end , to death for jobs and to aspire to . i was someone , so that may be brought about giving 
by dropping out of a worsening matters . i prefer death education and i do not live my life , and i want to live . 
i must have done something i do for the year , and i will this year , turned for the year . i did not have much time left to fail .
i once failed to college and do another course i can get , i did not want me to go through the system and consistent failure . over and over . 
some could i please . any advice ? 
and see if you can go to the doctor and see the way he could get to extend your deadline to try to ease the pressure a bit you ? 
sent like this posted on your tutor and consider mitigating circumstances . they were not worried that some people of admission to see all the things that are not comfortable with the best and much more before i know the use , including work for the department because of the administration . 
breaking what work can manage to chunk 
concentrated 1 a bit at a time . the work is part of what has been obvious in the 1 , on the most urgent thing of assignments .
not shut-off housemate and well done to try new things . from the very beginning , so keep it now . 
i am with you . you go to see your doctor should be , too . 
maybe if you are always anxious to speak for the benefit of friends to get therapy to nhs . so really it is normal because of anxiety .
trying to get an extension of the deadline and to be honest , i am sure your university allowed . 
getting to keep strong and keep carry on live hard .

i wish i could wipe out her from the people . i live a good thing . the best of the best and so much more without her . 
but then i thought i was just selfish . 
but not like this . i live , and i mean , sure . 
it was good of the best of the best and so much more , as it should be . 
but i feel like i have no control over this spiral toward the downhill 
and i do not know what i do . 
thank you for reading . 
nice vented . 
she could not get a section that 
she even had a history of mental illness or had been diagnosed ? 
sure , you would not know that you are not going to get a good grade , so if you can accept the accept the place . 
life throws at you all the time .

i think i ago 2 year becoming much more weak people between dull and down and tried to make friends with some in the university , my personality is the way
but over a nice lead people to believe that i can say whatever the hell people want to or do whatever to me . 
they show absolutely no respect for them . 
i said hello , someone , and i ignore . but minutes later , someone decided someone wants to help me . some of the work and give help someone , for example .
it has caused a lot of anger in my life and distress in life . and really , it started affecting my concentration in the university . 
anyone got any experience to handle this sort of thing , or how to go again , gained some respect ? 
just say 
if it is not particularly comfortable . you do it gradually 
you can start with , sorry , i am busy , but it is not . 
with it , of course , you are not going to over the top that you do not go in the direction of a complete opposite direction . 
if you think the mind said america 
they started they were more respect when they are starting to realize that you are not over . they are bending over backwards . 
well , this is really such a bad attitude . of course , you would have been nice to you not nice to just let them do anything to you , but can respect . that is not a nice person , but that is a fool . 
i do not know anyone reading this ? but i just feel i was desperate and felt i need i tell someone 
i left home when september and i start with the university , i was incredibly anxious about me doing this , but i think this is delayed until i got here . i feel it all terribly overwhelmed and feel i am not socially awkward , intelligent and i are here now , and i have been here over the week .
i was in a way that is emotionally struggle , the majority of my life . even though i lost my dad around me . for the year , and i always blamed the loss on what i feel since i moved to secondary school . i have in my life . period . i counsel in december 2009 around march for 15 months is roughly the same as this year .
i felt like part of the problem is i live not credible . overwhelmed and i make , i doubt my always low self esteem ever more in a moment , i , i doubt about anything and everything . not being able to concentrate and to find work . i became very quiet . often the occasion when the society . 
i 2 i counsel not to diagnose depression , and that suggests to me that the huge not suffer depression , but i worry about depression , so my dad died because of their suicide .
i was trying to solve my problem . as before . and i find it particularly useful exercise and meditation also tried things like the book , the tape of the self help , and help , but i generally felt this was what i live ? i wasted one chance and one chance . a young man is beaten at me . this is what i feel away . 
i simply do not know what i do , and when i think about what i do . i never follow-through copyright trade . friends often said i was lazy and could not disagree . when a lot of the time i feel things like anyone is trying to do everything possible to help time and time again . fail . 
i am sorry for anyone reading this jumble mess . and i have a bit of a feel like me . people who moan self is seeking , but i truly feel desperation . 
when i was at the new situation is , and feel the pressure to socializing with strangers and fit the new role , such as students become what people feel to the existence of a more intense for the common people . 
i am not a professional healthy and i could only speak from personal experience , and with me . so i strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about things you feel depression and you worry . 
most people feel no intelligent person and awkward when 1 get university , so you are definitely not alone in the university , but you get the appointment service you counsel in your university . i really do . you should not really matter , to tell you the depression last year , last year , depressed or not , you obviously have some problem when there was a minute and you could use some support what the label is not important than you experienced things , meditate and exercise really helpful . so are you trying to do , but to have to engage to help and general life to get somewhere , but not beat up , feel no motivation to do anything because when the minutes . a lot of people feel that things like this and when y8 to begin with . you feel that there are more , well , hoping to pass things not only worsen the kind to you , you feel kind of with you and get some help .
good luck . 
i think a lot more would feel the same way , but you feel you medicate people by using a friend ( b ) is probably not as such a solution is definitely better you when you are depressed , friends around than you are alone and depressed , but either way , if you feel free to chat with fancy private messages . 
if i was you , i would focus on the aspirations of someone such as idol , you end up with a marriage , etc ) . someone was successful , and the happiness of someone to have a family of someone coming from a bad background , you are , they are not what you want to do you admire someone you respect , but 
do you focus on the achievements in life . you have not stated that what you study , or , indeed , why do you want to study the experience ? y4 mum because you want to go ? why you need a degree for career ? because you want to . 
do you have something you can say , like , hey , not a failure , and the hard work it is , and the pass . when you get your degree , so you either way . in sum , why you were there and work your bottom off to get the best possible grade

what do i do ? 
thanks for reading . 
you on any drugs or drugs get any therapy ? 
should be . talk to your school nurse or your gp and told them what was going on , or 
you can tell schools to teach you . people could trust . 
if you tell people who can help you . 
if you keep bottle-up it . inside , it is likely that it will only get worse . 
i trust the good to get these things , the earliest as possible instead of letting things get worse , even the best and more . 
you do not do this , please . 
for the year , and last year i started self harm is one of the main cut my arms but to stop harm 1 a few months ago .
it is hard to it , but you can do it . 
i felt i had so much more happy , but i see the scar to remind me what i felt at that time , and is so strong , so i want to do such a thing for me , as a pain . 
also , and strong . you can do it . i find salvation and keep a journal , writing poetry 
self harm is addictive . but you can overcome the harm 
remember self harm does not define you are . 
could overcome it . 
always , i find that every time i go out in the direction of the university , especially to check the things i belong to ensure i do not lose anything or i have not left anything because of the past year . so , i think i got a form of ocd .
i often i have to twice go checks and after 30 seconds . for some reason , not resistance can then check again .
why are these 
me , or something ? 
it is most often when it but it rarely carry things carry many things , and even many still . every day , to check for any extent ocd is this disease ?
so what am i doing to this can 
if i am not check i got sort of goes away after a minute 30 very anxious , but much , much , much , much , so i could not wait that long , often anxiety .
i would feel if i lost my wallet , or my phone , i feel the doom or doom 
i just wish i might not be in the minutes , every time i leave something or something to worry about . i have lost something . to go out .
i really do not know what i have to do and afraid i would go into the general practitioner 
probably they never heard some compulsion . like this , and i just do not know what i do . 
any of you people have a ritual like ? 
thought i was crazy , but it is to get out of this very strange difficult . 
you can advise me what 
i used to do this when my way into college , have a list of things on me . i know i have the items and use the compulsive check in the bus . 
so if you are just trying to when fresh weaned on habits , habits , relatives , and with it , but also tell you that you do not keep to check these things , there definitely was a visit to the doctor . i have more severe anxiety now , and i think this is a sign warning , i know that is easier said than done . 
a doctor , see a much , much worse . that is because the case is not worried . 
i :p do about psychology class today .
just to avoid the act is that the compulsive way possible . get rid of it , so you do not check you lose something and just left it at that . 
gradually , luxury has decreased during the overtime , hope to disappear because your ocd despite the increasing level of your anxiety for a duration
for i just that sounds . instead , you have a really bad . you are over ) is the anxious
i am very obsessed 20 1 got up to check on the night , particularly with all the lock to lock in my house .
sometimes the time i convinced they are not a lock i know they lock 
i think it will become a real problem when he started doing really interrupted your every day , routine .
definitely not crazy , so no worries and i am sure that you are a gp to understand the issue . 
i went to therapy in order to encourage the others also reason and i cut down , obviously . i picked less than 20 times to check the numbers , and i stick to the numbers . 
i teach , i think , is the idea , and if i were 5 or 20 check to check , i was still ok . 
i would be a lot more of the best so far , and i think that definitely hopeful that anyone who wants to improve the improvement . 
i would not worry too much . usually , i was pretty calm about things , and i liked it . i take it as a coming . 
but the find really has become anxious , in the past month month , and i am not talking about mere feel nervous from the blue .
i am beginning to feel i have a variety of beforehand . when i am not too much worried . not even cross my mind as something so ring alarm bells in my head . the irrational panic . 
i am not sure a lifestyle change to go from free care the students graduate , not employment . because of this , or is this a sign that other issues ? however , at the beginning of the bug affected by this . i have this confidence and i am happy , so 
it is , so to speak , for a few of the parents , but the same people including all thought i was going in random phase i until there is clearly a serious problem and should be held off action . 
so , wondering what is the best thing to do . 
you speak it to the doctor and you saw the pill to counter the anxiety can be taken off the edge . from what ? 
i see that i can speak to counsel ? 
or i should i take what people around me that are advised by the closing and until the anxiety has become a problem . just keep an eye on the anxiety ? 
well , did not start with trying to keep an eye on your anxiety eyes makes me more and more likely to panic because of the demise of circle should be there . 
trying to when you start to feel a bit of anything to panic as-soon-as y y and focus on something that is guaranteed to make you smile . or should i feel more happy . 
if not , well , you can do that , or get a friend who makes you laugh when you start , you feel the panic . lol . works for me . it is random and suffering panic attacks . 
at the start of the just started a tiny really worried , although without severe than you from the sound thing . 
i find just talking about things that make you are anxious for someone else to help . 
i find it makes me feel better about things , so i know things are not that big a deal , and i do not need to be . i was anxious , things i mentioned . i worry about what my mum and see people react to that i should react to the situation with calm . but not to moan , perhaps get in the way . 
however , if it is worse to go to the doctor . 
i had a friend that people suffer severe anxiety may prevent leave the house , and what to do , so worried about things that could go wrong . 
doctors give the medication for her , and to make good , she is the best and much more .
