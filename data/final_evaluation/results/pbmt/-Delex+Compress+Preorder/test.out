resolute support to start a thread , and composed the poem , i reply . 
pledging to defend the diaoyu islands , died in the fighting and related to the island . 
the japanese boats fish bump evil little ghosts stirred up trouble and unrest again they showed their wolfish appearance with a heart and a thief arrogance form . 
never went back to that when we when we sign the humiliated time strong china appeared sharp and shining buried the approaching enemy . 
nine of the 11 in 2010 . 
resolutely bump up . i agree with the analysis that the thread . if you are really starting to come to war , i would like to be hua mulan to pledge the best fighter i die to protect the dignity of our nation to defend our homes , defend our homeland and the spread of our chinese prestige . 
i very much wish during the long march in a passionate upsurge that mao zedong was born in order to spread our dragon prestige extinguishing all chinese , the enemy completely wrong . i lost my head and shed my blood . 
how long would we tolerate japan . 
said fellow citizens . 
hello , everyone , we all know the september 18th again now , the japanese premeditate plans for another incident at lugou bridge in the sea , the sea , another like me , though . 
defying the whole world with a strong condemnation of the country and opening a surprise invasion of our country sacred territory diaoyu 
always , we all know that the diaoyu islands belong to china , of a history , a reason to become what we originally belong to the controversy . 
is our thing , our things and why the necessary negotiations . my fellow citizens to go even further in the fact of occupation want to create this can we allow ? absolutely not . 
i said , japanese militarism brought grave disaster to the asian people , fellow citizens . 
in china , especially the suffering japan to ravage the country for as long as several decades . 
as cruel as the japanese unit 731 experiment on live human bodies in china , korea , people who live in other countries , people live and extremely brutal methods in the northeast of nanjing massacre added that never fade away layers of blood in the ancient capital city of over 1,000 kilometers of bloody big battles in changsha and hengyang bare bones of the dead in the battle , and kill off everything . 
saying too many difficult way , by not exhausted all the bamboo strips record , cited the instances that japan committed a heinous crime , fellow citizens in china . 
just like those of the soul of the deceased souls lost tens of millions of lives over the pacific ocean and wandering souls find rest . peace is difficult . 
all experienced that era still vividly remember the era when any turn the page and read the pages of this history , our younger generation also cry even stream down , tears in our cheek , and our blood is boiling with indignation 
actually , japan wants to reverse the verdict of their aggression history , now wants to wake up to a fellow citizen , asia and china . 
although we we will look back on this 100 years of shame , our pain . we were going to face them , we must not resolve the history issue to create history and choice of history . 
responsible , so we are not afraid of the small territory , related to them as a matter of dignity , but we could not let the separation of our native land , land that scar the land , despite the wounds of the national unity and interests , no matter how changes in wind and clouds to guarantee the honor . 
i say the advent of the chinese nation in the 21 st century during a difficult time beset inside , outside and face the press , however , meant many things to challenge fellow citizens . 
we go to china , an aggressive foreign force or the surrounding environment , the taiwan issue , the tibet issue and the south china sea issues , which way should . 
what do i do ? fellow citizens , you look at a map of the world . please and encirclement coveted our national territory to suppress breathing and crescent - shaped encirclement encirclement is strangling our development . 
never fear , though . we do not want to make an enemy is not afraid of the us even though we do not want war . 
we must urgently . we arranged for arms and strengthen all military forces in the air , land and sea . 
several times , thousands of years of a flourishing chinese nation never had ambitions of expanding outward , but of the new territories . 
not imposed , not what they want other foreign security strategy because we followed the application of philosophy and benevolence and virtue . 
like the liberalness tolerance and individual tolerance and avoid the liberalness we hurt others , we insist that we do not have to hurt , though . 
tolerance is not certainly fear and cowardice , sincerity is not having to 
china exempts repair world war ii japanese war to serve on the benevolence of peace . 
i said people &apos;s heroes monument is a condensed history of the chinese nation to strive for continued improvement in the nation of fellow citizens . 
the magnificent posturing represents a sacred , solemn expect peace . 
many of the heroic tragic scenes that have sprung up in shining armor , spears and horses . stir occasionally agitated in my mind of my memory thoughts strings . 
go , i thought . history , that is like the yellow pages seen kangxi alone to contemplate how to achieve unification , territory . his audience hall , hundreds of years ago , ruling that a generation of famous emperor abraham lincoln also wandering alone in the dark , the great hall , think the integrity of the union and the former u.s. president . 
peaceful in the world , it is to forget the war certainly dangerous , though . i would say never exercise forbearance , although we want development and peace , fellow citizens , humiliated and betrayed the nation in modern times , the boxer protocol aggravated china is a poor and backward country is falling behind , leading to a bully 
if it were not for the strength of what is to come in peace . 
we have to establish a national defense system has a full range of capabilities to attack the defense system , and the system . we have to focus on education , national defense and building up the great wall in the heart of the 1.3 billion people . 
the best defense , attacking the strengthened force could be engaged in forced ultra long range attacks and improved a great distance great depth should combat capabilities in all aerospace premises to avoid influencing the development of the national economy , establishing a high quality elite high - tech divisions to increase investment in the defense industry and the construction industry and accelerate the modernization of military equipment and internationalize 
ready to go about to sound the battle horn and is already fully equipped 
with no support , we accomplished nothing . all that we will support our powerful . 
time to say no to others . i have my fellow citizens , we have to because we achieved . 
one established to guarantee funding for the recruitment of hundreds of thousands of professionals linger to emigrate to the united states and around the world . the information back to china and improve the working environment working mechanisms . 
the two created a few nuclear powered aircraft carrier battle groups . 
three manufacture 5,000 various kinds of advanced combat aircraft . 
four of the accelerating research of intercontinental range ballistic more than 10,000 nautical miles of high - speed missiles that could break a missile defense system and deploy the missiles . 
5 resumed nuclear experiments and to establish a military force in space . 
6 to retain thousands of nuclear bombs and tens of millions of tons of tnt when necessary to install nuclear warheads to be installed on all the short - range missile and in the middle of the range of missiles . 
7 , to retain capable of inflicting devastating enemy nuclear strike , three submarines , 30 , a strategic nuclear submarine . 
eight abandoned the commitment not to use nuclear weapons first . 
9 , as a threat to national security retain the right to preempt a strike 
my fellow citizens , if only to us . we are confident we can improve . we strongly strives to unify china . qin shi huang zheng chenggong recovering taiwan is our responsibility to carry on our predecessors have a strong willingness to far , and we have to see the insight 
now called shake that tremble far motherland , embrace a piece is a piece of land and moan courageous move forward to carry general previously did not fulfill the wish things forward . fellow citizens . 
when i read history . simmer heaviness and angry . my heart into my concern . i am willing to volunteer to serve our country , for the motherland is prosperous . and once again , there is a splendid and not regret even if i die , but i was born to cloth gown and common people . the show is my patriotic sincere heart adequate heaven . 
by ci here of classical form , i composed a poem to voice my heart to aspire to . 
painted a deep red lips 
to protect the diaoyu islands . 
we are losing our bitter ryukyu islands . 
how can allow the fall of diaoyu islands . from other countries . 
100 years of vicissitude 
smoke clouds chase fly and wave . 
the youngest brother is still tender youth . 
wander was born in all directions and seals . 
looking over the flag 
we have our brandishing weapons and cross the east . 
let the drink of the pacific ocean . 
6 , 26 , 2002 . 
the title of other articles , i have a dream book for taiwan compatriots . it is expected to be how long tolerated without ever begging the olympics . but if we forget history , the history of hardship , hardship , more people . i was the only one country , one nation and its culture in sport may be overdevelop declined to state the country strong and the people wealthy or official , the wealthy and the poor ? the government is disgusting . ren zhiqiang shut their mouths , hateful people housing prices can pity for google , said the company does not have the right to remark on what the us is not responsible for what the japanese government has strongly opposed the bombing deserve to be ban ki @-@ moon presented bouquets in hiroshima , strong , my brother and sisters , we need a star or a low level of entertainment , technology innovation , talent ? no shame on li yinhe , writing in contemporary times , letting garbage get off , please children ! and the need to build a memorial museum or the chinese national hero temple 
why are we not fight a little japanese . 
the chinese , who are still tolerated . 
they even riding in our heads . 
the chinese people still have the guts to do this ? 
we told the whole world could not be bullied by others at will . china should . 
the time when we will show our strength too long to calm china . 
of all the lives of our citizens are currently too extravagant , too carefree is official . 
already , we had no cohesion , china now is the need to start the war following the harsh slap on the part of the government of the united states . a rear facing the country . 
let them know that the us is no panacea . if we win , china can increase the influence and cohesion , improve citizen . if we lose , we can clean out incompetent bureaucrats , and make getting the trash out to let china has new blood , and updated china get up ! 
go to china . 
i would suggest that to protect the fishermen and the sovereignty of our country , china , to strengthen the guard of the diaoyu islands , and daily to guard the island , by military force if japan dare to invade our territory . we have no matter what the cost to fight small - scale wars , not how we defend china may be lost . 
we need to show is that in life . but the show really embrace . 
i was just passing by 
like this , the whole society star 
not sexy , damn . 
no , it was totally acceptable . 
agreement is just a cheap entertainer somewhat sense what they in feudal china . 
they were looking for a glorious life . 
group nine professions . 
a hard life . 
shocked . 
that is normal and there is always a whore is heartless and not righteous performer . 
they want money , but they do not want to face . 
look for ms. wolf glasses near the fans . you know , actors , if not force him out , or not even in the frame with him to drink . 
son of a bitch . 
loveliness as long as something to eat ok . 
an easy one is like a live show . you look at the script , you have to know how to be performed . 
somebody is all 
the top score imperial examination to 360 people in all walks of life at the top of the imperial examination scores so people behind the effort and endeavor to this humiliation , bean vermicelli words . 
haha 
overdo 
reality . 
shooting that hooligans . 
cheap performer . 
cheap performer . 
the entertainment circle was dirty . it was all men are scum birds and beasts 
what a pity they are not easy to blame , but that the star female 
not everybody can do this . if you do not do this , how to make money . 
the women in front of other women , is proud to be a woman in the melancholy mood , but stay alone . 
prostitution is just as popular in ancient times . nowadays , the star is put by the plain people . now they are famous people . prostitution is just normal people because they had drunk with some high official . or should they even sleep with officials . 
stop talking . the other just behavior . 
what do we do in the future , should be able to alone is not enough , we will face success too hard to choose such a thing ? 
look at the glorious disguised more suffering is indisputable . 
they just played in their circle out to see out of mind . so it is not so bad . 
zhang jizhong , the old guy behaved hooligans in his circle also thinks the guy is not virtuous but making talent series on tv . the guy has done nothing wrecks of the whole chinese people . 
both take what both need . 
when china could have a purely innocent girl . 
now the story is very shocked the entertainment world , rumors that forced hsu yuki out refused to arrange to drink with the guests and switch to lawyers instead of to work in order to make ends meet . 
the super star much envy , people often encounter , but people are not welcome to join or social engagements or circumstances . 
many of the interest has to do with many aspects and there must be a reason , after all , not many can be decided . 
for a star , not that simple for us ordinary people seem to be very normal like dinner parties sometimes can imagine . 
the stars have a lot of contracts . and if people have to tackle well . roll the money source if not tack . well , she was forced out , or even come to frame her heel 
the two female stars are smart . that is kind of the first kind , always hold very high integrity and stern rejected all such invitation 
the second kind is good for playing tricks , and with their seed money to achieve their objective . 
rumors that some even super star , who won the first of the female role this way : 
after drinking alcohol . some people can sponsor ads that show a chance of kissing a cheek lying shoulder to female star female or feel the chin of the female and most enduring attitude will be adopted . 
they are the nine lower profession very people . 
that star is actually just a pretend to be living a much better life than this damn ! 
agreement is just a cheap entertainer somewhat sense what they in feudal china . 
agreed . 
oh well , no easy actors 
they asked that they deserve it . 
by dawn , nothing is easy . 
worse than the birds and beasts were men , women , beasts and birds .

braawwkkk 
it did not take long . 
in late 2004 , opened the circumference ran around the southwest quadrant of the richmond regional routes , the new urban highway 288 
already it has changed because of the worsening development patterns that pattern , and it will cause localized traffic congestion around its exit . 
today , the richmond times - dispatch tells the tale , the impact of the powhatan county huguenot trail . 
jones reported traffic will more than double in the huguenot section of the trail . since opening , 288 
the surge of speed and the accident as well . 
so far this year reported 17 near the intersection winterfield road accidents , up from 12 accidents in all of 2004 . 
the virginia department of transportation resident engineer dale totten noted that if they had more money , about $ 13000000 four lane road . 
vdot , of course , does not have the money for the construction of a road in richmond region . 
vdot frigging 288 spent all its money to local politicians , teachers and so boost 
what happens when you need people to be homer simpson 
this is a major moment , doh 
288 route we predicted , generating residential development in scarcely populated areas all around the exit of the road overtax a local road . 
others choose a location where they work and where they live to limit access to the highway traffic relief , the driver in the back and forth between the chesterfield county goochland county , but the county . 
and they create congestion in new places . 
the only surprises me how this rapidly . 
even i think the lag may be three or four years . 
think created all exit routes of religious liability costs 288 already created 13000000 dollars . construction of the road , just one exit . because of this . 
another predictions 
soaring needs new and improved roads , after more than a year . a few scattered subdivision , commercial development and approval of mega projects , major roads intersect , 288 
well , we could see a zoom . no fund liabilities well past the highway was built to take $ 400 million before the end of the decade as the original . 
said brainiac 288 route is thought to be such a great idea . 
thanks for nothing . 
i think we can be better spent elsewhere , 400 million dollars . 
i think you blame 288 to create those people not , you should . 
what if they had enough . they created a new traffic congestion in new places , alternative . 
additional traffic congestion in the old place ? 
now you understand , such as fairfax tmt feel a thing . 
i usually take my position to favor road . 
excess , with 288 is definitely a glaring need , but in the other part of the state . 
richmond had virtually no traffic . 
in the last 30 minutes during rush hour . 
and give them a beltway through largely rural areas . 
the road to nowhere . 
just think , you could spend another cross the potomac facility at nova , or a desperate need to improve roads , this money . 
as i said , the rest of the state , to help pay for the rest of the 288 in the last year to deal with the budget . to add insult to injury , wiping out debt payments in virginia , centrist 
very nice . we are obliged to all of you . 
not much makes sense , though . 
it was the same old problem . 
if you get ahead , you need you so sprawling are accused of 
if you build in a place already acute need to claim you could not pave your way out of congestion 
anonymous 
that is a fair point . 
5:26 makes a good point . 
this situation will hammer the validity to what state audit report found . instead , the fund is based on a comprehensive plan to transport to a state based on the people who best vdot ctb lobby and the fund for transportation projects , but at home . 
i submit this is a disgraceful situation should not be tolerated . 
chichester , and senator and his toady poured more money into this flawed institution . so this is worse . 
what things in expenditure on transport . 
the virginia it benefited a private business plan and it will not serve the interests of the public . 
all of you are dead wrong . 
walter stoch , no less , has stated that it intends to pay money for economic development for 288 
come on . 
i said that i do not understand their point tmt 
the last time was when , not some sort of business or from business , you are stuck in traffic . 
it seems to me the whole road . the road will facilitate the public interest for the public to get into private business and the public will get from the business . 
overwhelmingly , though , of course , needs the support of a soccer game , a sunday drive , of a grandmother and a trip to his location . 
no wonder the suffering the congestion problems do not match our expenses on the road , of what a business or the state to increase due to the domestic product . 
if we recognize the benefits of primary roads , businesses should do two things . 
of course , what we pay to pass more of the bill for the transportation and business incentives to locate business in business with the least stressed that even if the system is to locate the overall travel mean more business . 
it was so hard to understand why . 
solving the functions of human settlement patterns and balanced transportation capacity of the system to use land to generate demand for travel . 
spin all else . 
emr 
in virginia , tmt said it benefited a private business plan and it will not serve the interests of the public . 
i do not see this statement appeared to point to demonize the private business plans and put the public interest above all else . so 
i think they are intertwined , so they are virtually the same tight 
obviously , this is a local problem . cookies , lumpy , so the dough ) . 
if we long enough to demonize business . eventually , we found that we all work for the devil . but in aggregate 
i see no claim to solve the balance with ever changing dynamic nature . 
you even see the rail to dulles airport was a positive job centers to promote the bidirectional because demand for rail . 
i agree . 
in fact , that is reason for all of it is built on its own may be sufficient . 
all i said to apply the logic of the road should be exactly the same . 
they have a destination at both ends should be for the maximum use of us investment . 
we need more places for us to get closer , you say we need a balance . 
a reality check here . 
morning and evening landing watkins drive past . 
i have to commute back and forth to the location where i work huguenot trail . 
i have never seen anything remotely like a flood , traffic . 
it was 55 speed-quantity zone between 75 to 100 every morning for what car . 
already plans to widen the huguenot robious road trail , funneled through a whole bunch of zone years ago . existing development development in chesterfield side and new school . because of heavy demand . 
instead , the lack of road bottleneck powhatan county and west chesterfield wonderful 288 road that we the people are actually using the roads . 
commercial development as we can , and we can work closer to our lives . 
you might think that would be the irrational use of land 
i have no desire to live in any of the city . 
i refuse to work in the downtown area . 
i refuse to use mass transit , female unsafe while commuting long hours without regular work . work . 
it happened , and i would like to develop a large lot . 
i do not understand exactly how i keep horses . in the 14 acres was supposed to be a lot . 
i can go to one gallon of gas for $ 10 . 
and still pay for life . 
many people prefer a certain type of legitimate small businesses , horses , and hunting gardens made do not want to live in the urban core . 
this infatuation with living in a city that truly baffled . 
6:37 anonymously if they wish to live , have every right to live in the country . 
you have no right to the rest of the state underwrite the cost of 400 million dollars for the construction of the highway easier to shop , and get to work , but 
consistently overlooked what else will spend 400 million dollars to 288 debate . 
if you apply the money to other press road projects or forbidden . even without the road project could alleviate much traffic congestion

i break up with my father and son since august . 
i want to start dating other and my son . the father said that if a date had nothing to do with people . 
very possessive and he was very controlling . he would not , however , because together we are the right .

if the price he is voluntarily walking out of both in your life , you probably would be better off not having him for you . 
i agree that the date is the date or not is the business of no one other thing .

hello , i started at the university in september . it was not immediately obvious , but most gel 
i know i will take some time to adjust . i was always very introvert . i was especially anxious and shy , but all the rest . 
all of my housemate and go out the first night i was here and went out in the hardest thing i ever did . 
when i was sober , i go by the student union bar . 
more to the point , however , the facts here . 
i did not enjoy . after about 5 months i have been here i did not much like the courses i deliver courses disillusioned and do not enjoy a set of projects . 
the university make out much better than it seems 
i was a bad start , the first - term pile all concluded that because of the delay in financing , the students added to the stress level , and i was so worried , because there is no work in progress 
if an honest opinion . not really work out . see , i never opened up the university to assign the people and block a counseling session that saw about five weeks to six weeks . 
only half of the heart . 
as a result , depressed and miserable all the time . i feel i am now loaded into the neck of my work , and i had to hit major deadline 
i no longer have that you can only have so many session at a time and i doubt if i have already had not helped much help this time . 
i feel i want to give in to not end up with dead end jobs and those who aspire to be someone who can be brought about to give in . but the lack of motivation , and i do not feel comfortable with the people lecture 
worsening matters by dropping out of education , i would rather die , and i do not live my life , and i want to live . 
i had to do something . i was 21 years and i will this year , turned for 22 years . i did not have much time left for the failure . 
i once failed to college and do the course i can get another . i would not want to go through the system , and the consistent failure . over and over . 
please can i have some advice ? 
you can go and see the doctor and see how you can get to extend your deadline , trying to ease the pressure a bit the way ? 
like to send this post to your tutor and consider mitigating circumstances . not to worry . they have seen some of the worst in what all admit that much more uncomfortable among before . i know i used to work for the department because of the administration . 
breaking work can manage chunk 
one at a time . concentrate on what is obviously a bit of work for the first time , the most urgent of the assignment . 
no shut-off housemate and well done to try new things . from the very beginning , so keep it now . 
i am with you . you go to see your doctor should , too . 
maybe if you are always anxious to speak a friend get the benefits of therapy to the nhs , so it is really a normal due to anxiety . 
trying to get the deadline extended . and , to be honest , i am sure your university is allowed . 
got to keep strong and keep on living hard . 
my mum a divorce . she had a horrible time with my stepfather and the new by sending her to a round she found her on the bend 
she is epilepsy and manic depression . she has a huge problem with anger . 
she was constantly horrible for me . 
when i was in the home , not able to cope with her outburst and nasty , hateful things of her remarks . 
i am 18 years old , 95 percent of people in full - time study bursary students in private schools . high pressure in the form of a sixth break point . 
not because she shouts at me i could work at home . 
then my teacher , so angry . 
when one minute she is lovely , like a mummy , i have my back . and then the next minute when she turned into the most spiteful of human life . 
i will not pass on all my exam , and i had already accepted defeat this year of my life make me fail . 
who knows ? maybe i can come back from this offers the most amazing . i could not even accept the offer , but i would never make the grade 
i wish i could wipe out her from living the good things , the best of the best , so much more without her . 
then i thought i was just selfish but 
but not like this . i mean , sure , life . 
it should be the best of the best , so much more . 
i feel like i have no control over this , but the direction of downhill spiral . 
and i do not know what to do . 
thank you for reading . 
nice vented . 
not that the section she can get . 
she even has a history of mental illness or diagnoses ? 
sure , you would not know that you are not going to get a good grade , so if you can accept the accept the place . 
life throws at you all the time . 
unless someone in your family outsiders 
as long as eight years , to deal with verbal abuse . my dad came to me before and it is the only way out is the only reason why i was here , to be honest . 
if you really want to hard - working out . 
the real sounds as if she could not give a consistent . you need support from somewhere else . 
childline , or something like that . it can be called that organization ? 
on saturday , may go to the library and study the library was good for 8 hours . 
you can go to your friend house form study groups ? 
a bit of a pain in the arse and blamed it for all your problems so you want section ? 
i know what you feel . 
spit , too . my mum from hell . 
i highly recommend to take up smoking . 
oh , grow up and stop the tsr nag . it was a joke . 
i think i have in the past one year , two years , becoming much more weakness down between the people and a way to dull my personality to try some friends at the university . 
over a nice lead people to believe that i can say whatever the hell they want , or do whatever , but for me . 
they show absolutely no respect for them . 
say hello to someone , and i ignore , but 30 minutes later , someone decided to help someone who wants to work , and to give some help to someone , for example . 
it has caused a lot of anger in my life and in distress in life , and it really started to affect my concentration in the university . 
anyone got any experience to handle this sort of thing , or how to go again , gained some respect ? 
just said . 
if it is not particularly comfortable . you do it gradually 
you can start with sorry not to , but i was busy . 
of course , not with it . you go over the top , you are not going in the complete opposite direction . 
if you think of the mind said , new 
as they are starting to realize that you are not , they are bending over backwards to start them more respect . 
well , this is really such a bad attitude . of course , you have a nice , not nice . just let them do anything you can to respect . but that is not a nice person , but that is a fool . 
i do not know anyone who reads this ? but i just feel i was desperate and felt i needed to tell someone . 
i left home in september , and i start with the university . i was incredibly anxious about me doing this . i think this is delayed until i got here , but i felt it was all terribly overwhelmed and feel i am not socially awkward , intelligent , and now i have been here , and i have been here for over two weeks . 
emotional struggle with the majority of my life . even though i lost my dad around nine years and i always blamed the loss of feeling since i moved to secondary school , i had two in my life . period . i counsel in december 2009 , around march this year , roughly the same as for 15 months . 
the problem , i felt like my life was not credible and overwhelmed , and i have made ever more , i doubt my self esteem has always been low at the moment , i have my doubts about anything and everything . not being able to concentrate and to find work . i became very quiet . often when a social occasion . 
i , 2 i counsel not to diagnose depression , and suggested to me that i did not suffer depression . my dad is a huge worry , depression caused his suicide , however , death . 
i tried to solve my problem . as before , and i find it particularly useful exercise and meditation also tried things like self help books and tapes , the general feeling is that this is going to help me in my life . but what ? i wasted one chance and one chance . a young man is at i beat this feeling away . 
i simply do not know what to do , and when i thought i was doing things i never follow-through them . friends often said i was lazy and could not disagree on a lot of the time i feel like anyone is trying to do everything possible to help . time and again , failed . 
i am sorry for anyone reading this mess and a bit of a jumble . i feel like people moan self . i truly feel i was seeking , but desperation . 
while a new situation and is feeling pressure from socializing with strangers and fit the new role as students becoming people feel things more intensely the existence of common people . 
i am not a health professional , and i can only speak from my personal experience . so i strongly suggest you see a qualified health professional about your feelings of depression and worried . 
most people feel no intelligent person and awkward at first getting so you are definitely not alone . at the university , but you really get your appointment . your service counseling at the university , i should tell you there is not really a matter of depression has not depressed last year or last year , when the minutes . obviously , you have some problems and you could use some support what label is not important compared to what you experience is really helpful to meditate and exercise are you trying to do to help , and generally engage in life to get somewhere to not beat up , feel no motivation to do anything in a minute , but because a lot of people feel that things like this and when y8 began to feel better hope to pass things is not kind to you , only you , feel worse kind to you , and get some help . 
good luck . 
i think a lot more would feel the same way you feel people by using medication . a friend , but it was probably not a solution . as such , you definitely better when you were depressed friends around than you are alone and depressed , but either way , if you feel free to chat with fancy private messages . 
if i was you , i would focus on the idol you aspire to someone such as background , came to a bad end up with someone who , etc ) . married to a successful and happy someone has a family , someone you are not , you want someone you admire , you respect . 
do you focus on what you have achieved in life would not state what you study , or , indeed , why do you want to study the experience ? y4 mum because you want to go ? you need a degree for career because you want to ? 
either way , you have something you can say , like , hey , did not fail , and work hard to pass it , and when you get your degree , so you sum , why you were there and work on your bottom can get off the best grade

i hope this helps . 
i am not a pretty much autistic , i did not , i think , but doctors who misdiagnose diagnosed with dyspraxia i walked on my toes . but nearly all of the time . 
it would be better . i was comfortable . 
what makes their decision to toe sign of autism seemed to be walking so random and not always indicated to walk .

the symptoms of autism is that walking on the toes can 
a brain tumor can be a headache symptoms . 
a lot of times feeling tired is symptomatic of leukaemia , can 
if the symptoms are not always apply in this instance , clearly in a lot of cases , the symptoms are worth noting , because if not , nothing is ever diagnosed but noted . 
i walked on my toes . but bear with straighten from surgery two years ago , the toe curl under . strange to walk . 
autistic is my brother . i have not noticed that , either . but what a broad spectrum autistic and mildly aspergers because i had a problem with communication and i did not pick up a society / body language will probably react . 
but then , i did not have the proper things , and even have some symptoms . you have a certain conditions may not mean . 
tell me not to walk out on my toes for years . so i walked on my toes . not much . 
i have dyspraxia 
so it might be a short or have a tendon dyspraxic 
the people doing the dance drill / etc. on it now , i find it more comfortable . 
i have not read too much into random symptoms like that . 
hello , i am addicted to self harm , a 12 year old , two days after the girl at the age of 13 . 
when i was 7 , i started to slit each individual fingers . scissors . and from that day , i will never stop . 
it was worse . i have a scar on my leg . i was about the name . my ex boyfriend slit legs staples . if i bleed , i will not stop because because of cuts . 
i have several slit in my arms . 
they are to heal , and then cut to the staples robbery school and razor 
i could not find the cuts take with lager and vodka . i will take around five paracetamol and other drugs . 
as i write this , i really tempting for me to cut my arms or burned . 
when i was addicted to heal cut again . 
i think about it every day . 
i was 12 and my life are already sick . 
this is my dad left when i was 7 years old and did not want to know the source anymore . 
he just cared about his new little girl , his wife , his new life , and where i am not wanted .

my mum and have also suffered a bipolar depression . 
i do not want to stop . 
i do not care to do what i want to do things that once again and again . i was tortured . i hate me . 
but if you are doing anything he has done loads , i loved my best mate , and that means the world to me . 
i did not tell him . but he found out . 
i do not want to hurt him . i did not want to hurt him . 
what do i do ? 
thanks for reading . 
you on any drug to get any drug or therapy ? 
talk to your school nurse or your gp and told them what was going on , or should . 
you can tell schools to teach you . people could trust . 
if you tell people who can help you . 
if you keep bottle-up inside . it is likely , it will only get worse . 
trust me , this is a good thing to get the earliest possible rather than letting things get worse even better 
you do not do this , please . 
at 17 years and last year started self harm is the main cut my arms to stop the harm a few months ago . but 
it is hard , but you can do it . 
i feel so much more happy , i see the scar reminds me i felt during that time and so strong , so i want to do such a thing for me . but painful . 
also strong , and you can do it . i find salvation and keep a journal , writing poetry 
self harm . but the harm is addictive . you can overcome . 
remember self harm does not define you are . 
it can overcome . 
i have always found this past year . every time i go out to the university to check , especially with things that i belong to ensure i do not lose anything . or so i have not left anything . so , i think i got a form of ocd 
i have two in one go , i often had to check and after 30 seconds . for some reason , then could not resist again . check . 
why are these 
or something ? 
it is most often when it but rarely carry many things and many still carry even one every day to check the extent of any disease that ocd is this ? 
what i can do for this . 
if not checked , i got sort of goes away after 15 minutes 30 very anxious as much , because i could not wait that long , but often the anxiety . 
i would feel if i lost my wallet , or my phone , i feel doom or doom 
i just wish i could not worry about every two minutes . i left something or i lost something going out . 
i really do not know what to do and afraid i would go into the general practitioner 
they probably never heard some compulsion . like this , and i just do not know what to do . 
any of you have a ritual - like ? 
thought i was crazy to get out of this very strange , but difficult . 
you can advise me what 
i used to do this my way into college , has been on the list , and i know i have the items and compulsive use . check at the bus . 
so you just tried on a relatively fresh weaned on habits , habits and also tell you not to keep checks on these things , but there definitely was a visit to the doctor , i have more severe anxiety now , and i think this is a sign warning , i know , that is easier said than done . 
doctors see much , much worse . because the case is not that worried . 
i do about ocd :p psychology class today . 
just to avoid action that was a compulsive way possible to get rid of it , so you would not check you lose something and just left it at that . 
l gradually decrease in overtime , hoping to disappear because your ocd , but increase your anxiety level of longer duration 
for just that sounds . instead , you have a really bad ocd are you anxious over . 
one night , got up to 20 checks , particularly with all the lock to lock in my house , and i was very obsessed 
sometimes , when they are convinced there is no lock to lock . i know them . 
i think it will become a real problem when it started really interrupted your daily routine . 
definitely not crazy not to worry , and i am sure your gp understand the issue . 
i went to therapy for other reasons , and also encourages me . obviously , i picked less than 20 , cutting down on the number of checks , and i stick to the numbers . 
i thought i was teaching ideas . and if i have five checks or 20 checks are still ok . 
i have a lot more of the best so far , and i think anyone who wants to improve . i definitely hope for improvement . 
i would not worry too much . usually , i was pretty calm about things , and i would like to take as coming . 
but the find really has become anxious over the past month , two months , i am not talking about the mere feeling of nervous from the blue . 
i am beginning to feel i did not even cross my mind as something caused alarm bells to ring in my head as i am not too much worried about the variety of irrational panic . 
i am not sure changing lifestyles go for free care students graduate unemployment because of this , or is this a sign that other issues ? i began this bug affected by this . but i was confident and happy . 
speaking to a few parents , it is all the same people think i go to random phase i held off until it was clear a serious problem but should act . 
so , wondering what is the best thing to do . 
you speak it to the doctor and you saw against anxiety pill could be taken off the edge . from what ? 
i see that i can speak to counsel ? 
or take what people around me by a close adviser and , until it became an anxiety problem should just keep an eye on the anxiety ? 
well , would not start to try to keep an eye on your anxiety eyes makes me more and more likely to panic because of the demise of circle should be there . 
when the trial started to feel a bit of anything you as-soon-as panic , you focus on something guaranteed to make you smile or feel more happy i should . 
if not , you can do that , or get a friend made you laugh when you start , you feel the panic . lol . for me , it works randomly and suffering panic attacks . 
to start , just a start , a tiny really worried , though , than you have not severely from sound thing . 
i found that just talking about the things that make you anxious to help someone else . 
i find it makes me feel better about things , so i know . no big deal . i was not needed and what i am anxious to what i mentioned i was worried what my mum and see people react to that i should react to the situation with calm . no moaning , but perhaps a way . 
if you go to the doctor , but worsen it . 
i have a friend , is suffering severe anxiety may prevent left the house and did what was so worried about what could go wrong . 
doctors give the medication for her , and she made good on the best and much more .
