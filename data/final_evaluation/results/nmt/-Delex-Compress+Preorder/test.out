i agree with the thread , i agree with the thread that started our home and defend our enemies , i would have to be able to fight our homes , and i would have to be able to fight to the defense of our nation , and i would have to be able to fight to defend our national rhetoric .
i would be very much wish to be born at the long visit to mao zedong , i 'd lose my head , i would have lost my blood and lack of all the chinese enemy , i lost all the chinese enemy , i lost all the enemy .
how do we rely on japan ?
i said my fellow citizens .
hello , everyone , everyone knows that we are all all of the times in the sea , but we all know that in the surface of another incident in the surface of the sea city .
japan insists that the whole world is strong and a open invasion of our country , and a open invasion of our country .
the snp has always known china , we are always known by the history of the history of history , because the history of history is all .
what is our things of our own things , why are our fellow citizens and why do n't we want to create the facts to create the facts on the fact that we can allow the facts to create facts on the fact ?
in my fellow citizens , i said the japanese is going to bring out the upper disaster .
imperialist china has reached a long over the long decade .
the japanese ambassador to a human body and the japanese live of the chinese live of the chinese living and other countries who live in the northern city and the other countries who live to the end of the death of the people who live to the end of the death of the death of the killing the death of the killing the death of the killing the death of the death of the killing the death of the death of the death .
i said there are too many of the creatures that have been applied to my fellow citizens on their fellow citizens in china , which is difficult on their fellow citizens in china .
just like those items who lost their lives who lost their lives will be difficult over the pacific island and found the rest of peace .
it 's still so to remember that the accident is still because we have been turned down at any history of history and read our blood , and we read our blood and read our blood , and we read our blood and read our blood .
it is now because japan actually wanted a mistake in the history of its history of the history of the history of china and the chinese people in asia .
if we look back to this 100 year , we have to go back to the history of this 100 years , let us have to face the history and choose history .
because we are not afraid , we are not afraid of the fact that our civil land is small , but they are small , but it is a small thing , but it is a small portion of the country , but it is that we are a small land of the country , but it 's not to let our civil land .
i said the principle of the chinese nations in the chinese nation , and we face many things in the outside of the outside of the outside , and we face many of things in the outside .
we should go in the issue of taiwan , or the south china china 's foreign forces , the issue of china , or the south china china 's foreign forces ?
what do i say , do you look on a fellow citizen , you look at the world , but look at the world topic , and to avoid our national territory , and to avoid our national territory ?
we never fear , but we do n't want to make their enemy , but we do n't want war , but we do n't want war .
we have to have the arms and maintain all military forces and maintain all military forces in the air .
however , in several years , the chinese nations has never had the consequences of the chinese nations , but the chinese nation has never had a monopoly .
we are following the foreign security premise that we do n't want to do with the other people who do n't want to do with other people .
like the country , it 's like the country , and to avoid to avoid a other people to avoid the other people that we do n't have to pretend with the other people .
it is certainly not fear and it does n't have to be forgiven .
in the united war ii , the united war ii launched to japan 's war in the united war ii .
i say the attention of the people of the chinese nation is a moderate history of the chinese nation of the chinese nation .
the grass @-@ roots irony that is expected to be expected to develop peace .
in my mind in my mind , many of my mind in my mind in my mind , in my mind , in my mind , in my mind in my mind .
i think what i think with the history of the history of the history and the former u.s. president , i 've been going to have to see that a " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " and " former u.s. president " and the former u.s. president and former u.s. president was left out of the great text of a great text that thinks that the great club of the union was left out of the union .
in the world , it would certainly be peaceful in the world , but i said the war is certainly dangerous , but i said that it would have to be developed , but i said it would have to be developed , but i say that it would have to be developed , but it would have never been bothered to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be

why do n't we fight a little japan ?
what is the chinese people to clarify ?
they even interviewed our head .
did it still do this ?
we should n't tell the whole world , that others should do with china .
time we showed our strong strength , too long .
all our citizens are the current life of our citizens is too appalling .
we have already had a riot now now , china needs to start to start the war of the united states version of the united states .
let them know the us to know that the us could be able to increase the chinese influence if we won china 's influence , if we were going to increase the chinese influence , let china had a new blood and and make it get out of it . let china have got a new blood and make it out .
go china .
i would suggest that china is going to strengthen the patriot islands , and protect our country in a small scale of a small scale , if japan expressed a small scale of us , we can n't be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to invade our allies .
we need to show a life in life , but you are really pissed to show you .
i just record .
the whole society is like this .
damn , no coherent .
it is totally acceptable .
the " cheap " " " cheap " " " " cheap " is just an awful sense of them , they are somewhat sense .
it looks like they live .
the group of 9 's group .
hard to life .
yep .
that is normal , and there is always a sin , and it is always a sin .
they want money but they do n't want to face .
look at the super tea st. , you know that you know people who refuse to be forced to not force to force or not even without an force with him .
hahahaha
if there is something long for something else .
it 's easy like the show to show that you have to know how you have to know how it happens .
all logic .
in rural life , there is a top of all of a life of life in the 60 life , so this is so in the top of the people who are in the top direction , and this indicates the word in a " top " word ".
haha ...
hahahaha
reality .
break that strange .
blacks are cheap .
blacks are cheap .
discrimination is sexism . all men in it is all the man in it , and homosexuality .
they are a interview , but that 's not easy . that 's not easy .
everybody does this , if you do n't do this if you do n't do this ?
the woman when women have been born in the other front of the other people , but when women were left .
nowadays , it 's just a normal person that was put up in the typical time , it 's just a normal person that they are put up with some high officials , because they are now a joke , they are just stuck with some high officials .
stop talking about other people . you just nose !
what do we get done to do with the future in future , we are not enough to do with such hard things ?
more than a look at a time that is not possible .
it 's not so bad because they just played them out of the mind , they are not so bad .
a old @-@ old guy who 's also thought that the guy who was in his funeral , who also thinks that the guy has nothing to do with a piece of the whole country . he makes a letter of the whole country .
both are taking things .
how can china have a successful woman ?
the story is very shocking to the story , the story has been a very shocking in the world , as they refused to be forced to catch up with the emperor , because he refused to catch up to the emperor to make the end of the emperor .
there is a much break up by a while that people who do n't accept that they do n't learn to be born , but they have to join whether they have to join or the consequences .
at all , they can n't decide many things to do with many atrocities and many people .
the very normal party is that we can n't be that very normal party , we can n't be able to imagine a very normal party .
the people have had a lot of revenue , and if she was well attracted to their sources , if she was well , it is a lot of the money if she was well well , if she is well well .
a terrible female old old is a kind of female , that the first kind of the first kind of people are always held a very high form and rejected all .
the second kind of people are a second kind of kind of people to play and their own money .
in this way some way of some way of some way of some way of some way of some way of some way .
they can get a chance or a chance of the people who perform the show , or the pain of a multivitamin , or they are the best to be lying , or the pain of the pain of coffee , or it is the most of the pain .
they are a very lower teacher .
those guys just pulled and actually live much more damn life than this .
the " cheap " " " cheap " " " " cheap " is just an awful sense of them , they are somewhat sense .
agreed .
anybody who refused to be not easy .
they deserve it . they asked that .
nothing to be easy for me .
and the man is worse than ice and forth .


it takes it not long .
in 2004 of 2004 in 2004 in 2004 , in 2004 , in 2004 , in 2004 of 2004 , in 2004 , the alh 's new new fighter province .
it has already changed the development of the development of the development of the development of the development and caused it .
the telegraph has been told today today , today , the city of the city of the ocean county of the sun .
it 's reported that the number of trafficking of the drug trafficking has been discovered in one film in one section of the olympics .
dissent and images are consistent .
on this year this year is this this year to the 12 s of the subway road all in 2004 .
according to the u.s. department of the interior department for 4 billion dollars for 4 billion dollars for 4 billion dollars for 4 billion dollars .
of course , it does n't have no money to the construction of the road of the city region .
because of local politicians and farmers are spent by the local politicians , because the local politicians and farmers were carried out .
when you need people when you need people ?
this is a major moment !
the alh has reached the development of the development of the motherland , we applaud the development of the orbital station in all around the 1980 @-@ tech area .
other people choose to be in work and where they live , and where they live to live , and where they live to live in the back of the river , where they live to back .
and they create the seizure in new places .
i 'm surprised about this only .
even i think that the 3 years old or 4 years .
do you think that the legislation has already created the cost of the price of the road that the eu was already created to the cost of the road in one of these creatures .
another ha .
after a few years , the need to be needed to be needed to be a new impact of a few years after a few years for a few years for a few years .
well , we can see the 4 billion billion dollars in the end of the fact that the fact that the op will take a 4 billion dollar .
i said that the alh is a such great idea .
thanks for nothing .
i think we could be able to spend over 300 billion dollars .
i think you should blame that that people should not be created for you .
what if they are enough to create a new wave of heroin in new places ?
a ring of executions in the old places ?
now you understand what people such as hitler feels in manhattan .
i usually take my position to the sake of the road .
it is definitely a coward , but it 's definitely a coward in other other states .
the los city is also not having traffic .
20 minutes in 30 minutes .
and you give them a largely complex area .
surgery .
just think that it can be spent in the facility or a desperate need to be used to be able to be used to be able to be spent in this money .
in the last year , the rest of the state is trying to pay the debt at the last year , the rest of the state will help to pay the debt in the last year .
we are very nice of trouble .
not much sense though .
the same problem with it .
if you get up , you 're accused of need to cause .
if you build place in the place in the place where you have already built your way , you can n't grasp your way .
mina
that 's a fair point .
samsami made a good point .
however , this situation is complicated , but the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state of the state .
i pray that this is not the situation of the situation that is not the situation .
and as a senator , the senator , the senator is a senator , it 's the more money of this valid institution .
what is the point of the prices ?
it 's the benefit of a private business plan , and it does n't happen to serve the public interests .
utterly wrong .
there was no less than not less than a non @-@ mart to develop money to develop the economy to develop the economy .
come up !
i do n't understand the point of his point .
the last time when you are not for some sort of business or you are stuck for the business or your business ?
i seem to seem to be a whole point of the road that the road to get a private business and get their business from the business .
the business is needed to support the business , but of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course , of course .
there is no wonder we are going to have to suffer the problem with the price of the road , because we are not raped or state .
if we recognize the primary in the primary , we should do two things .
the business is paying what the business business passed for us , and we justify the business of the business of the business , but the business will be able to block the business in the level of the business .
why is it so hard to understand it ?
the solution is to be solved , and the balance of the system of the nature of the value of the value of the value of the value of the value of land production .
all else .
mina
jane said it is about the benefit of a private business plan , and it does n't happen to serve the public interests .
i do n't see the point of this state point , and putting public interests and put public interests and put public interests .
i think they are entitled to the same that they are insulting .
it is obviously the local problem with the local problem of this curve .
however , if we are long long as long as we are long enough , we 'll find us all work .
i do n't see the claim that the claim is to solve the balance of the fact that ever changed .
you have even seen a picture for a bit of the sword , because the shooting is a job , which is a job center .
i agree .
in fact , that is all in the fact that it is being built in fact .
i 'm all saying that the exact same logic should be denied .
they should have the balls in both end to the end of our investments .
we need more places to get us more close to what you say .
here 's the reality here .
i drove the past at the morning at the morning and last night .
i reckon i 'm going to back back and forth where i work .
i 've never seen anything expensive like the drug trafficking .
it is in the extent of the explosion , the car is a car where the car is a car .
in a whole bunch of years , and the new school has already been accused of the city , and a new school , and the new school , and a new school in the last few years ago .
that 's the kind of people who actually use the road , and the other of us who actually use the road of the road .
we can be a computer development and we can work in more effective .
you can think that is using land without rational .
i have no desire to live in any city .
i refuse to work in the box area .
i refused to use weapons of mass seeds who have been a long working working hours .
and i 'd like to like a large lot .
i do n't understand how to keep a load of a lot of a lot for a lot of a lot .
a gallon of $ 10 billion dollars can go .
and i still pay for living in the country .
many people are strongly honest , and a small business , and a small business , and the small business of small businesses and the small business business .
i 'm simple in the city of the life of life in the city of life .
if they wish to live every right to live in the country to live in the country .
but you are not right to the rest of the state of the state of the state , but the rest of the cost of $ 600 billion dollars .
what else can be spent in the debate in the debate that can spend $ 300 billion .
if money fails to be applied to other internet projects , even if the money will be applied to the other internet projects or even .
according to what i comment on the site of the road of the road that the bus was near the road , and the system of the subway of the subway of the road of the road , it is supposed to be directly to be linked to the contract to be near the property or lack of this ruling .
and i am 50 years old , i 'm a couple of years .
my son was broke to my son since august 8 .
i want to start to block other people and my son said if he had nothing to do with him .
he is very helpful and he was very likable , but he is not the right because we are together .
the right now went too much in his life , and he thinks he did n't love him and he did n't love him in several times .
he would want to do n't too need to do with his son .
but he has no one to do with his family and family and families have the issue .
i do n't want to be optimistic , and if he was more long around he was around .
i do n't want him there for a good father or trying to try at least his son .
i believe every child needs both parents , or not together or not together .
but he can n't have to think if he can n't have to have .
what do i do to move on my life ?
your ex is very bad to use your son to use your son .
you do n't have to give that because if you choose it , then you would have a choice .
you are right to live your life and happy you are happy because he sold you .
if he really loves his son , he saw him , but it 's just a typical ship , even if he used to control .
the other people said it would be like you , if you leave me to kill me ?
carry on .
meet all kind of kind .
do what you want .
if he was going to walk out of your life , you probably would probably come back to your life .
i agree , you are not a business or not the other other thing .
i do n't tell him .
but he did not cause because he is not concerned about your personal life .
can you document his threat ?
you really need .
forget to the call he called and make sure he left .
make you appeal with you or you .
keep that record .
get a lawyer and honor .
you can n't try legal aid if you afford one .
tell the need to go back to your ex @-@ eye , please .
the bus will want exactly to change the road , and the people who cease your food .
did they do n't realize you do n't get a change on the bank ?
does someone have to take a piece somewhere somewhere ?
people get a simple .
i like i 'm near the most of the day as i can n't like i do n't like to count .
if you take 20 cents on the bus , they just tell you to get it up to you .
there would be no legal amount of the amount of honesty such as you can pay something like 30 yards .
hello , i started the university in september , but i 'm not obvious , but i 'm not in the most people .
but i know i would take some time to take some time to take some time , and the rest of all the rest of the rest of me .
the first time i 'm in the first time and i went to the last night when i 've ever done here .
i was going to go out of my student unions in the front of students .
but here 's the point here .
i do n't enjoy the university after the 5 months , i do n't enjoy a university , and i do n't walk to the actual project , and i do n't walk up .
it makes me much better than it seems much than it seems .
i 've been out of the first term term on the first terms of student students , and so i 'm so worried so so it is so worried to my work to work .
if i 've never served at uni , and i see the people to see for 5 weeks for 5 weeks , i 've never moved to them for 5 weeks for 5 weeks .
only half heart .
i 'd have to have to have to work at my chest , and i have to hit a major distance , and i would have to have to hit a major distance .
i had no longer had a doctor who can be able to be able to be able to only be able to be able to do so many at the time , and i doubt if i had already any help .
i would have been able to break up , but i do n't feel angry , but i do n't feel to give my choice , but i do n't feel to choose to give them to the end of the end of the death .
i prefer to death and i do n't live with my life , and i do n't live with life i want to live .
i have been 21 years old , and i do n't have a much time , and i do n't have much little time to fail with me .
i fail to college , and i do n't want to get another course , i do n't want to go through the system and i do n't want to go through the system .
can someone advise some of me ?
can you go and see your doctor and see how you can get a bit of touch to try to be a bit of touch ?
send a email like this post and consider the consequences of the outcome , you do n't worry about it because i do n't worry about all of the things , because i do n't worry about some of the things that i do n't worry about what i work .
break out what you work you can perform .
do you separate one one one of the one of the work of work in the first time .
do n't elaborate with your ears , and well do it because you try to be a new drop in the very beginning .
i should go to you to see your doctor too .
if you are always a tiny person , you are going to speak for someone to speak for the nhs so it 's really tough , so it 's really tough .
try to get backwards and if you disagree with it if you disagree with your university .
keep strong and keep the loss of life .
my mum got a horrible time , she has a horrible time with a horrible time , and she has been sent to the hands of her .
she was a lawyer , and she was a huge problem with a huge problem .
she is a horrible for me .
i can n't cope at home when i 'm in home , and i can n't cope with her fingers .
i 'm a 18 year old , with a full time in a high school , which is a full time in a high school in a high school .
i can n't work home in home .
then i 'm scared my teacher then .
she was confused in one minute , like i have to live and then turn in the next minute , and then the next minute turned her .
i 'm not going to pass my christmas , and i already accept that this year and my life would make me failed .
how can i come back to this back , but i can n't even accept the offer , but i can n't even accept the offer .
i wish i can spot her from my life , so much more than her .
but i think i 'm just selfish .
but i 'm sure i 'm going to live like this ?
it should be so much better .
but i feel like i do n't control this reaction .
and i do n't know what i do .
thanks to reading you .
nice .
you can n't get her out of that .
she even had the history of her ill , or she has even had the history of her ?
sure , you do n't know you do n't get a good fish , so if you can accept place .
life is a life of life all time .
if someone of your family is not someone 's family .
i have a long for 8 years to my dad , i have to abuse my dad before i came home and it is only a reason that it was only a reason .
if you really want to work out of hard .
really sounds like if she can n't give you supporting you need to support your support .
can you call the va or something like it ?
you can go to a doctor , and for a good couple of hours in the shower .
can you go to the house of your friends for a form of service ?
would you want to be a bit of pain , and blame for all your problems in all your problems ?
i know what you feel .
my mum is too integral to hell .
i should get high .
oh , rush , and stopped it . it is a joke .
i think i was in a much more racist and two years ago , i do n't think it was a much easier easier to try to be a much easier to try to try to me .
but it 's a nice lead to the people to believe that the hell could be able to believe the hell , or do whatever they want .
they showed absolutely no respect .
but i 've said someone to say someone from the university , and i 've made someone to help to help some work and give someone to help anyone to help some work .
it caused a lot of honesty in my life , and it really started to affect my diet in the university and it really started .
anyone got any attempt to handle this sort of things or how to go down some respect ?
you just said no.
if it does n't sort to you , if it does n't sort of honest .
you can start sorry but i am not busy .
of course , you are not going to go over over the top of you do n't go to a complete opposite .
if you guys think it is no one you 're saying .
they started more respect to them when they start to realize they are not over over them .
well , this is a really bad attitude that is such a bad attitude , but if you 're nice for you just let them do anything to do anything to do anything with you .
i do n't know anyone reading this , but i just feel to tell someone to tell someone to tell someone to tell someone .
i 've left home in september and i started a home , and i 'll have to have to have to do this , but i 'm in the two weeks , but i am in the two weeks , and i am in the two weeks i am in the two weeks and i am in the two weeks i am in the two weeks .

it may be a brain disorder .

it does n't always apply to the note , but if there is a lot of cases to be worth a lot of cases , so it would be worth nothing to be worth a lot of cases .
i walked on my nose , but i 'm born with a straight year ago , but i 'm born in the two years ago .
however , my brother is that my brother is not so offensive , but i do n't notice it is so offensive , but i 'm not going to notice , but i have a problem with the practice , and i do n't pick a society , but i have a problem with society .
anyway , but i do n't have a proper skill , and even having some sympathy to do with the actual condition .

i 've started at a 7 years old , and i 've never stopped the individual , and when i never stopped that day .
because i do n't stop it because i have a load of my birthday , because i did n't stop a cut , because i did n't stop a cut from my ex
i have several legs in my arm .
they were drunk and i 've cut them out of the school , then i 'll cut the school .
i would take to take around and the other drugs and the other drugs and other drugs .
when i wrote this when i wrote this is my arms to cut my arms arm or drive .
i 'm confident i 'll cut me again , again .
i think it was one day .
i 'm 12 years and my life has already sick .
this is what my dad was going to leave and do n't want to know that when i was 7 .
he just cares about his new girl , his wife , his new life and his new life .
my best buddy was my best beating me .
i relationship with a 16 @-@ year boy , and i 'd have to speak for the boy and different .
my mum also will suffer and have the stone .
i do n't want to stop .
i do n't care what i do to do . i want to do things . i want to do things .
however , i 'd love my best love , and i mean the world means if i do anything if i do anything to do anything .
i do n't tell him but he found .
i do n't want him to hurt him . i do n't want him .
what do i do ?
thanks for reading .
are you in any drug or get any grief ?
you 're talking about your schools , and your gp , and tell what goes on .
you might be able to tell the school members of the school .
if you tell people you can help you .
if you keep it in the inside , it is likely to be the only bit of it .
i trust i was a good thing to get this earlier to get more than getting even worse .
do n't do this please .
i 'm 17 , and i was starting to be willing to be willing to apply to the main cuts , but i stopped a self @-@ cut .
it is hard to do it but you can .
i feel quite much more happy to see that i feel much more happy , but i 'd want to do such things , but i want to do such things .
also , and it is strong , you can do it , you can do it in the writing and keep up .
you can be able to overcome harm but can overcome harm .
remember how you are not afraid of education .
you can overcome it .
i do n't think i was going to check to me when i 've always been able to check me at the past time i 've always been able to check my dad , so i do n't have to get a massive seat .
i can n't have to have to have to check my year , and after 30 @/@ 30 @/@ 30 @/@ 30 @/@ 30 @/@ 30 @/@ 30 @/@ 30 .
why is this ?
i 'm crazy or something ?
it is the most often more often to carry out , but it 's just a day , and it 's still even one day for a day . this is just a type of disease ?
what is i doing this ?
if i do n't check me , i get getting a long to go away after 15 minutes or 30 minutes , but i can n't be able to wait at that long .
i feel if i lost my grandfather or my phone or my phone .
i just wish i could be able to leave something or lost something with two minutes .
i do n't really know what i do , and i 'm afraid of going to the general photos .
they are probably never heard to this like this , and i just do n't know what i do .
any of you have a riot like you ?
people think i 'm crazy , but you get this very strange .
what can you write me ?
i used to do this in my way , i 've had to do this in my way in my way in my way i know in my way i know .
so you 're just trying to say that you are just trying to have a more appalling , and i do n't have to tell you that this is that you do n't keep your doctor , and i do n't keep it easier to say that this is a more easy than what you do .
do n't worry that because the doctor saw much worse cases .
i do n't do to do with gitmo in the class class today .
the way you are just convinced that you can get rid of it if you do n't check it and just leave it and just leave it .
it has been designed to be equipped with your inventory , but so you are a small level of your inventory , which will eventually fly .
you just just sound at that sounds like you have a really bad .
i 'm very scared to check the last night to check out of my house in my house in my house .
i 'm shocked , but i know they won't get rid of them .
i think it will become really a problem with the real problem to start your day .
you definitely do n't worry , you do n't worry about your gp and i 'm sure your gp .
i 've gone to the other reason , and i 'll add to the numbers of the number of the number of numbers , and i 'll drink the numbers of the numbers .
i think i 'm a idea , and i 'm still ok with me if i checked up or 20 @/@ 20 .
i 'm far a lot more and i think that anyone wants to improve improve .
i 'm pretty scared to me , and i like to take things to take things to come from how much things come to come .
however , i find me to have to be a really calm out of things before the past three months and i do n't talk about a hot feeling .
i 've been beginning to feel that i do n't even enter my mind that i do n't even enter my mind in my head that i do n't even enter my mind in my head .
i 'm not sure this is the change that it is going to be going to go to the free payer , because this is going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be happy and i am happy to be happy and i am happy to be happy .
i speak it for a few parents of my parents , but all of the same thought i should have gone to me , but i 've been going to have to be able to have a break up until serious problems .
so what is the best thing to do ?
you speak on the doctor , and see that the anti @-@ roots bus could take the spoils from what it can take .
i see i can speak for people ?
or should i take things to take a close around and until they become the problem when they become the problem ?
well , i 'm not going to have to try to get a couple of your chest and more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely .
you 're going to try something to make a bit of a bit of anything that makes you to feel a bit of anything , or feel happy that you should be happy .
if you can n't do that or get your friends to make you feel to feel when you start to feel to feel when you start to feel to feel when you start .
when you are n't as severe as you are not as fast as you are n't as fast as you are n't as fast as you are .
i find it just talking about what makes you a insult to someone else .
i find a better deal that i know that i know that i know what i know , i know that i know it is a good deal with my mum and i do n't need to appease the situation , but i know what i should be worried about my mum .
but if it is worse to the doctor .
i have friends to have friends to prevent the house and do what they can leave the house and do what they can go wrong .
the doctor gave her to her and make her good better .
