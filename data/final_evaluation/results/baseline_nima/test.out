supporting me started with thread , resolutely replies composed a poem 
the pledge ! fight for defending the diaoyu islands , the islands and relations with death . 
bump a fishing boat for japan , a ghost fleet stirred little evil trouble and show them the appearance of unrest again with a wolfish heart arrogance was a thief and form . 
back up your time , that does not appear to us that humiliation when it signed a treaty and never back up a strong china is sharply up , sword and knife buried shine ! let of approaching enemies . 
the 11 september 2010 . 
analysts agree that started a thread on bump up resolutely by people like hua mulan , a home , and to protect our homeland and defend our prestige is spreading its pledge to fight to defend the dignity of the chinese nation . most of the deaths came in a real war . 
bearing wishes in the event of a passionate upsurge that long march of mao zedong , to lose your head and shed the blood of extinguishing all that is wrong for china to enemies of our prestige is spreading , complete with dragon very much . 
we tolerate japan itself ? 
according to his fellow citizens . 
hello , everyone is planning another sea of japan incident at lugou bridge incident and another in the sea like premeditate now and again . we all know that september 18th 
japan defied the whole world by surprise and strong condemnation of the sacred territory of our country , whose opening of invading the diaoyu islands . 
the diaoyu islands belong to china , as always , as we all know , because of historical reasons . all our belongings have become controversial . 
according to our needs , and so many of our fellow citizens , our negotiations with japan would go much further even wants to create a fact of occupation . how can we allow this ? absolutely not ! 
said of the japanese militarism has brought grave disasters in asia and their fellow citizens . 
china suffered especially ravage japan for several decades long 
the japanese unit 731 experiment by the chinese people to live a life , korean people living in other countries . those methods as too brutal by human body extremely cruel , in the northeast of nanjing massacre , adding a layer of blood will never fade away , and the capital city of the ancient barely big bloody battle in changsha and hengyang of dead bone over 1,000 kilometers and kill everything . 
saying too many instances of a heinous crime committed by japanese in china with a record difficult with strips of bamboo , exhausted , not all of whom cited by their fellow citizens . 
the soul of the deceased tens of millions of those who lost their lives wandering over the pacific ocean and find it just as difficult to rest in peace . 
remember that all the people who experienced that era still so vividly in my blood boiling with indignation while reading these pages of history to turn any cry more , and our young generation . even a tear streams down her cheek , also in 
because i want japan to reverse verdicts on its aggression history now actually wake up in china and fellow asian citizens . 
facing a pain , but we are going to look back 100 years . this is a shame to let history do we choose to create but unresolved issues and history . 
because they are responsible . we are not afraid of a matter of dignity , a small territory and guarantee the unity of the country and the national interest and honour , regardless of how the changing wind and clouds , not let our native land , even by separate scar may be wounded . 
according to a difficult time beset inside , but the press outside the advent of century 21 for the chinese nation and that we will face many challenges to their fellow citizens . 
what a way to go . we are surrounded by the taiwan issue , the environment or the issue of tibet to the south china sea issue , the foreign force should aggressively to china . 
say what ? fellow citizens , please look at the map of the world and the encirclement of the crescent - shaped breath to suppress our coveted strangle development of national territory . 
no fear . never . we do not want to make enemies . no fear . we do not want war . 
we arranged to have arms and strengthen the military forces on the land , sea and air with all urgency . 
they had no ambition to expand its territory before ever outward into the flourishing chinese national several times for thousands of years . 
because it was not imposed on what does not want other foreign security strategy , we follow the philosophy that the application of benevolence and virtue . 
liberalness of tolerance and of the individual and the country as a us insistence that no hurt we have to avoid hurting others . 
fear is not without a certain tolerance and not have a sincerity and cowardice 
exempt from china and japan to repair war since world war ii and served as a benevolent peace . 
according to a condensed history of the chinese nation , and strive to improve continuously people's heroes monument to our fellow citizens . 
posturing solemnly magnificent represent sacred expect peace . 
many of the scenes are springing agitate the heroic tragic about spears , whose shiny armor and a horse , a stirring in my mind the strings of their occasional memory thoughts . 
the thoughts went through the yellow pages in a history that people like to see kangxi and contemplate how to achieve unification with the territory of being alone in the hall , the audience now , hundreds of years before the famous ruler generation and those of the emperor and the abraham lincoln but also a wander dark halls with great integrity . think of the union when the former u.s. president . 
forget a dangerous war is certainly peaceful . in the world according to the exercise of forbearance has not blinded by never we want development and peace , our fellow citizens , aggravated the boxer protocol treaty of national betrayal and humiliation that china was a poor and backward at modern bully led to fall behind . 
if peace comes from strength , not ? 
we must focus on national defense education , building of the great wall in the heart of the 1.3 billion people to establish a full range of national defense system that can attack and defense . 
to defend and attack in the best we are strengthening a very and ultra long range attacks might engage in combat force and improved capabilities in aerospace as all great distance , a deep , great , you should let the defense industry to increase investment and accelerate the construction of up to modernize military equipment and internationalize do establish a division with the high - tech elite , of high quality , a premise that unavoidable influence on national economic development . 
when the horn sounded the battle about to people already in full equipment , ready to go . 
we accomplish nothing by people not for power , but with all the support . 
according to the time we said no other of their fellow citizens . because we have achieved . 
first , establish a fund guarantee of improving the work environment and mechanism to work professionally recruited hundreds of thousands to emigrate to the united states and around the world on information technology and linger back to china . 
second , to create battle groups of a few aircraft carriers , a nuclear power . 
3 5,000 aircraft manufacturing to combat various kinds of advanced 
to accelerate research into high - speed intercontinental ballistic missiles with a range of 10,000 nautical miles more to break for a missile defense system that could be deployed , and 4 . 
5 resumed nuclear experiment to establish a military force in space . 
( 6 ) to retain thousands of nuclear bomb equivalent to 10 million tons of tnt to install nuclear warheads in the middle range of the missile , a short - range missile and all , when needed . 
to retain strategic nuclear submarines , 30 , whose three nuclear strike capability to inflict a devastating enemy 7 . 
you abandoned the commitment not to use nuclear weapons first in 8 
to retain the right to strike is a threat to national security , pre at 9 . 
he said if only we strive to improve confidence and strong possibility that their fellow citizens . the unification of china , qin shi huang recovery of taiwan , zheng chenggong carry insight and saw far stronger will of his predecessors , we have a responsibility . 
moan call now to shake off a piece of land and a tremble in the embrace of the motherland is far from saying that carry let what people wish that in previous general of not fulfilling forward by moving forward with a courageous fellow citizens . 
simmer heaviness and anger in their hearts when they read about the history of the nation into our country is willing to serve as a volunteer for the prosperity of the motherland and a splendid once again and i regret that not even death to birth and one common cloth gown . it shows a sincere patriotic heart of adequate 
here , in the form of a poem composed classical ci to aspire to be the voice of the heart . 
let your lips painted a deep red . 
to protect the diaoyu islands ! 
the islands of the ryukyu islands , we lost in a bitter . 
allow us to the diaoyu islands , and other countries , how could fall .

the other book , titled an article to the taiwan compatriots have a dream that needed to build a museum or memorial . but a national hero for the chinese to tolerate it . we will not beg for the olympics in the country ever expected . if we forget our history more hardship , hardship is a cultural history of one country and one nation only in sports could the state declined to overdevelop ? officially , and poor or wealthy people , a strong country and shut a disgusting , filthy mouth , ren zhiqiang hateful in housing prices and a pity . they can even say google has no right to remark the responsibilities . we will not tolerate the us for what japan deserves to be presented to the bombers , whose strong anti - ban ki bouquets in hiroshima , strong up brother and sister ? we need a star or a low level of entertainment technology innovation , talent , a shame . not that garbage wrote in contemporary li yinhe , let children off , please . 
why we fight , not a little japanese . 
china still tolerate ? 
our heads even ride them . 
does this still chinese people with guts . 
telling the whole world that we will not be bullied by others at will and should be able to china . 
when we show strength to calm china as too long .

with no cohesion . we now need to start the war . china already is a slap in the country that followed the rear of the united states , faced with harsh 
let them know you are not a panacea for us . if we lose , clean of incompetent bureaucrats and make a trash can , let me get out of your blood . the chinese have a new and updated , get up ! china win if we increase the influence and cohesion can improve chinese citizens . 
china went up . 
suggested china strengthen guard diaoyu islands guard the day to protect fishermen and fight for the sovereignty of our country . we are a small - scale wars to defend japan if they dare to invade its territory through military force regardless of the costs they could not lose , china

the entertainment circle dirty beast , that all men are scum , a bird in it .

everybody does this make you money ? if not , can do .

stop talking to me just the other behavior . 
what we should do in the future . that alone is not enough to be able to successfully face ? we have such a hard choice , too . 
under the guise of looking for a more glorious suffering cannot be disputed . 
because they played in their circle out just by seeing off out of mind . it is not so bad .

two kinds of female stars as a smart , very high integrity and always kind of held the first such invitation and that all were rejected by stern

it did not take long . 
the highway route of 288 runs around richmond quadrant of new urban region southwest circumference opened in late 2004 . 
because of traffic congestion around the exit of localized already had to change its developing pattern , for worse . 
today , the richmond times - told tale about the impact of huguenot trail in powhatan county . 
jones reported that traffic will more than double in one part of the huguenot section , and the trail has since opened 288 
a surge of speed and accidents as well . 
the accident , near the intersection of 17 winterfield road where accidents , up from 12 in 2004 . so far this year , while all of the reports . 
a virginia department of transportation engineers and residents of dale totten noted that the four lane road , if i had more money to a cost of about 1.3 billion dollars . 
vdot does not , of course , the money for the construction of roads in the richmond region . 
because they had spent 288 for politicians and boosters of the local money for all his frigging vdot 
on homer simpson once you need ? 
this is a major moment , a doh ! 
288 that generated route development in a scarcely populated residential area on the exit of all around to overtax the local country roads , as we predicted . 
others choose where they work and where they live , but are relieved to have a limited access highway traffic . drivers between chesterfield county in goochland county , could be back and forth . 
and they create traffic congestion in new places . 
the only surprise in this rapidly . 
even thought the lag may be three years or four years . 
as you construct a road at a cost of 1.3 billion dollars . this created just one exit route was already thinking of 288 liable for creating the exit of all ! 
a predicted another opinion . 
soaring needed road improvements in new subdivision after a scattered development and approval of a major road , at the intersection of 288 commercial mega projects for a few more years . 
zoom , a liability fund , not to the past . the original 400 million dollars to take the highway originally built well before the end of the decade , we have seen could very well . 
according to a route 288 brainiac who think such a great idea . 
thank you for nothing . 
think we spend elsewhere , for 400 million dollars through better able 
do you think i should not blame that you created , 288 
the alternative ? if enough of them that created traffic congestion in new places , new 
traffic congestion in the old place ? airlines . 
you understand what such tmt in fairfax is feeling now . 
usually take a position in favor of the road . 
but excess is definitely a glaring at 288 with the needs of the state and other things . 
richmond has a virtually without much traffic . 
during rush hours , lasted 30 minutes . 
and you give them a beltway through very large rural areas . 
the road to nowhere . 
just because you spend this money or another facility where potamic cross the road improvements they need desperately in nova can ! 
how to help the state pay for the rest of the 288 in the budget deal in the last year that debt . to add insult to injury , wiping out virginia , centrist 
very nice obligation to all of us . 
but not much sense . 
it was the same old problem . 
accused by sprawling if you need to get ahead . 
if built in places where there is already an acute need not you pave our way out of congestion can claim . 
anonymous 
that is the point of being fair . 
5:26 makes a good point . 
but hammer , this situation is a valid thing for a person , a state audit report found that based on lobbyists in the best basis rather than by a comprehensive transportation plan for the state to fund transportation projects and ctb vdot home . 
submit that this is a situation that should be tolerated , not a disgrace . 
chichester and poured a senator and his toady , more money for institutions . this is a flaw that caused this worse . 
what transportation expenses ? 
it will benefit a private business plans and does not serve the interest of the public in virginia . 
most all dead wrong . 
no less walter stoch stated intention of paying money to 288 for economic development . 
come on , folks ! 
saying there is no understanding of tmt points . 
when stuck in traffic on the way to some sort of business from the last time you or not . 
to facilitate the public interest to get private businesses and get out of the road seems as a whole . 
despite the overwhelming need for a business trip of my grandmother as a soccer game , of course , for a sunday drive . 
no wonder we suffer from problems of congestion because what the road , not at the expense of what a business or increase domestic matches in the state . 
if we recognize that the primary benefit of roads , businesses should do two things . 
pay up business , of course , what passes for a transportation bill . we have more things to do , and the incentive to locate at least as much stress on the system , even if it means travel more overall . 
it was so hard to understand why 
solution of human settlement patterns of functioning and balance in our transportation system that has the capacity to generate demand for travel and use of land . 
spinning all else . 
emr 
tmt said it would benefit the private business plans and does not serve the interest of the public in virginia . 
he did not see his statement for what at this point is demonize private business plans and put their interests above all else to appear in public . 
think they are so intertwined with virtually the same tight 
obviously , local problems because the dough . these cookies are a lumpy 
but we find ourselves all in the work of the devil , and eventually , in aggregate , if democrats business a very long enough . 
do not see the point of solving the imbalance with the claim that the dynamic nature was never changed . 
you even see rail to dulles are positive for a job center and promote demand for rail bidirectional 
agreed . 
all the more reason to build it on their own . it was , in fact , that may be enough . 
on exactly the same logic should apply to all road said . 
they have a destination at both ends , so we should use more maximum investments . 
we need more places to get to balance the need for more closer said . 
here is a reality check . 
watkins drove past the landing each day and evening to the morning . 
where they work , commute back and forth through the huguenot trail . 
a flood of traffic as much as anything remotely like not ever seen in 
it was 55 mile-per-hour zone where a car every morning between 75 and 100 years ? 
already , because of demand in developing side chesterfield too heavy to a new school and development of the whole bunch that exists in the zone . a few years back that funneled through robious plans to widen a road in huguenot trail . 
288 of the wonderful people that we actually used a bottleneck rather than a lack of roads , powhatan and western chesterfield 
for commercial development . we can work in and live in , more could close . 
you would think in a rational use of land and not just that possibility . 
not any desire to live in the city . 
refused to work in the downtown area . 
refuse to use mass transit that safety is not a female with a long commute to work on other irregular hours . 
and it happens to like the development of a larger lot . 
i do not understand how to keep horses from 1/4 acre to exactly what was supposed to be a lot . 
go on a gallon of gas may 10 . 
and the pay is still living in the country . 
many people prefer horses and hunting gardens . certain types of legitimate small businesses that do not want to make a living in the urban core . 
baffled infatuation with this truly live in the city . 
according to the right to live in the country , every 6:37 anonymously if they wish . 
but you do not have the right to underwrite the rest of the state , a $ 400 million construction cost of the highway to shop and get to work more easily . 
over 400 million dollars in spending , what else can a consistency in debates , 288 
if the money is applied to press other road projects or projects of roads , not even god forbid ! much can alleviate traffic congestion 
according to the comments by directly investing in place on the road near the property owners , a lobbying and incompetence by the fund , regardless of what links transport master plan or lack of requests for how this system ray hyde

hello , started the university in september . but the gel did not immediately obvious in a city like this . 
however , certain adjustments will take some time for introvert a very anxious , especially when all the rest always shy 
go to my housemate , and all the people at night for the first time here and hard as much as you do . never had a 
go to a student union by sober at the bar . 
but the more pointed to the fact that here . 
enjoy no university after being here for about five months , disillusioned with the course not enjoyed in projects like setting much of the course was not delivered . 
make the university better than it seems to be much more . 
the first - term start delayed by bad finance student adds a level of stress and worry . so why could not progress . a pile of work , all due to a conclusion . 
assigning a counsellor in the universities are seen for about two weeks , five blocks , six week session work out is not really as open as ever , if not in the opinion of honesty . 
only half as much heart . 
loads of work now as his neck hit the deadline . as a result , will have a major depression and anxiety often feel miserable all the time . 
with a counsellor in longer because they only have so many sessions at a time when you can help much in doubt and this time will help . if it is not already . 
lack of motivation was not a comfortable feeling , a feeling of wanting to give a lecture , but brought about not giving because they can end up with dead end jobs and someone to aspire to . 
prefer death , uneducated and living a life that does not want to worsen matters by dropping out of university life . 
21 for 22 years at the turn of this year does not have much time left for a failure to have to do something about it . 
colleges fail once and did another course to get the university might not want to go through the system , and a consistent failure . over and over . 
can someone some advice , please ? 
do you go and let people see that doctors can and do ? a way to extend their deadline to try to ease the pressure a bit and get a can see . 
do the tutoring of sent mail like this post and you consider mitigating circumstances and not to worry because you all , including some that are much more uncomfortable to admit that they saw me before know because they used to work with the university administration department . 
and do you work for a manager can chunky 
concentrate ! one bit of work assignment . most urgently , first at a board . 
shut-off no ! my housemate and do them as well as try new things in from the very beginning , keep at it now . 
you should go to see my doctor , too . 
if someone is speaking for you . people are always anxious that my friends could get therapy by the nhs because it really normal for anxiety . 
and try to get an extended deadline for your university would allow it to be honest . 
to keep strong and keep getting harder to carry on . 
mum is having a horrible time with her divorced father and step free to find a new round would send bend 
epilepsy and manic depression . she has a huge problem with anger . 
in a horrible for her constantly . 
not cope with her outburst and a nasty , hateful remarks . there are things they can at home . 
with bursary 95 % full - time student at a private school , with a higher pressure in the form of a sixth at the age of 18 years at a breaking point . 
not able to work at home , as she shouted .

she is a lovely , in one minute , people like a mummy back has turned into the most spiteful human living in and then in the next minute 
not passing an exam of the a2 and accept defeat . and this year , failed to make it in her life already . 
coming back from this could offer that the university knew that what amazes me most is not accepted but may not even make the grade never 
i wish she could have wiped out life . good thing , too , so much , so much the better . without her . 
but then i thought about just being selfish . 
but that is not sure to live like this ? 
so much better , so much more to it . 
but it does not feel like this downhill spiral out of control . 
and not know what to do . 
thank you for reading . 
nice vented . 
not that you get her section for that possibility . 
even with her history of mental illness or had been diagnosed ? 
not knowing that you are not going to get good grades so sure if they can accept the place . 
what life throws at you all the time . 
if someone who is not a member of the family , you have outsiders 
to deal with verbally abusive dad , before i came to the university as long as eight years . it has to be here because that is the only reason , however , is the only honest way out of it . 
if you really want out of hard work . 
you need support from somewhere else . if not , she can really give a consistent sound . 
you can call childline , or something like that ? 
on saturday , when you go to the library and study may be in for a good eight hours . 
you can go to your friends to the house to form a study group ?

know what you feel . 
spit mum from hell , too . 
should take up smoking is much higher . 
stop negging grew tsr . oh , and it is a joke . 
think of a much more weakness in the past one year , two years , and become dull , its personality down to try to make friends with some people in the way it is in the universities . 
but led by nice people . most believe that over and say whatever the hell it wants or can do . 
they show absolutely no respect . 
for example , someone from the university and say hello , but the decision was ignored in 30 minutes later . they want work , and give some help . 
because it was angry at his lot in life and in distress and affect his concentration at the university really started . 
anyone who handle these sort of things , or how it goes some respect again to gain experience and get any ? 
you just say no. 
if uncomfortable , particularly if you do it in gradually . 
sorry , you start a busy , but perhaps not . 
you are not going to go over the top with it , of course , is to not go completely in the opposite direction . 
if you have a mind to think of saying no. 
they start to respect you more when you start realizing not bending over backwards for 
with such a bad attitude . this is real . well , of course , is nice but not as nice as they did anything , just let you can respect that but it is not nice to fool people . 
not knowing whether anyone reads this , i just feel desperate and felt the need to tell someone . 
home leave in september and start university being anxious about doing this too incredible to think , but was delayed till i got here . now there are here and there over the last two weeks i felt overwhelmed , it all felt very terribly and there is no intelligence and socially awkward . 
struggling with emotional life majority despite losing his dad at around age 9 years and blamed the feeling always since moving two secondary schools to have a period of counselling on living until december 2009 , around march this year , roughly 15 months . 
feeling like an overwhelming problem . my life is not more credible and made a low self esteem has always been a degree of doubt than ever at the moment is not capable of concentrated work often find became very quiet at social occasions in doubt about anything and everything . 
not that she was diagnosed with depression about two counsel and suffering . but not to worry , because a huge depression , so my dad died . cause of the suicide . 
trying to solve their problems before they find useful exercise and meditation , particularly things like books and tapes , self help and try to feel , but also what does live , however , this is a general waste a chance there , and one young man a chance to beat away at what i feel about this . 
what they do know is simply not follow-through and never think of what to do was never a lazy , friends said , and do not often disagree on a lot of the time you can feel , like a person trying to do everything they can to help anyone who failed time and again . 
sorry for anyone to mess with a jumble that reads this and feels like a moaning that seeks self , but felt a bit desperate truth . 
much more intense . it is a common thing that people feel exists . when there is a new situation , and felt the pressure of socializing with strangers and fit a role like that in a university study has become 
health professionals about that and not speaking from personal experience , and the only reason we can suggest that you see a qualified health professional with a feeling of depression and worried that strong . 
most people feel there is no intelligence and awkward . when i get to the university . the first reason is not alone in being you , but you definitely should get the services , a counseling appointment at his university would really matter . nor did anyone tell you to depression or depression . no , really . you had some problems in about a minute and can use some support than what you experience is not as much a label is important to meditate and exercise really helpful . why are you trying to do , but you have to engage to help and life in general will have to beat to get somewhere , but not because they felt the motivation not to do anything in minutes . a lot of people felt like this , and when you begin to feel better and hope to pass . not the kind that you kind of feel worse . not only do you have to do to get some help . 
good luck . 
what is more , a lot of people feel the same way , but you feel their medication use by friends , not a solution , but it is probably definitely better than being alone and more on you when you get depressed around friends . fancy that . either way , you feel free to chat in a private message . 
idol . if you focus on it you aspire to be someone like someone who comes to a bad end , whose background is happy to have a successful marriage and family . what you do not want it , but someone whom they admire and respect . 
focus on what you achieve in life studies or because indeed what you made no statement as experienced as you want ? do you want to go mum because they need ? you want a degree for career . 
working off the bottom of the order got the best grade you can sum , why they were there either way . and because they have something to say , could such a failure . hey , not a hard work , and it will pass , and when they get their degree .

why not have one or two that have signs of something on the autism spectrum , but it may well

symptoms of autism can walk on their toes . 
a possible brain tumor headache symptoms . 
a lot of times feeling tired could be symptomatic of leukaemia 
the symptoms are not applied , but it is always worth noting , if a case is symptomatic of a lot of time , so in this instance is a clear diagnosis of the reason nothing if not never noted .

being autistic brother , but neither notice but broad spectrum so as to have a mild asperger's because we have problems with communication and picked up no social reaction and body language . 
but then not have diagnosed properly and not what they mean . you have a certain conditions , even some of the symptoms . 
being told not to walk on their toes for years . walks on his toes again , not much . 
having dyspraxia 
dyspraxic a tendon or you have a short - term can be so .

hello , girls , aged 12 and 13 years of age . now , after two days of being addicted to self harm . 
started to slit each individual fingers with scissors at the age of seven years and have never stopped me from that day . 
it was worse because they had a scar on his leg as they slit the staples of my ex as a boyfriend because they were not cut . if the bleeding stops . 
several have slit in her arms . 
for staples , and the healing , they cut robbery and razor and then other schools .

addicted to cut again when healed one . 
come to think of it every day . 
a 12 year old and sick of life already . 
my dad left when i was seven years and did not want to know the source of this anymore . 
my new little girl , his wife and their new lives where he wants , he just does not care . 
my best mate died at the age of 10 years . 
relations between the 16 boys and forbade the speaking for events and different ages . 
suffering from bipolar also mum and having depression . 
did not want to stop . 
do not care what you want to do again and again to torture and hate . 
but love , my best mate at the capitol for the world if he did mean to do anything about it . 
but it would not tell him . 
not wanting to hurt . he did not want to hurt him . 
what to do 
thank you for reading . 
do you get any therapy or on any drug . 
people you talk to your school nurse or my gp and should have been told what was going on . 
as a trust , as you can tell from a school can be taught . 
if you tell people you can help . 
if you keep a bottling it . inside , it is only likely to get worse . 
trust is better on most of these things as early as possible , rather than let it get even worse . 
do not let you do this . 
at age 17 and started self harm and a cut on his arm , mainly in the last year , but stopped in the past few months . 
hard , but you can do it . 
so much feeling , so much the better . but to see that scar to remind feeling at that time was so strong , and why they would want to do such a thing , and pain . 
also strong , and you can do it , find salvation through writing poetry and keeping 86 
self harm . but you can overcome addiction . 
remember that self harm does not define you . 
you can overcome it . 
to find their belongings , always check to make sure they do not lose anything or leave no time to go to the university in the past year , especially in the form of ocd got to think so . 
to check every two to go . one often cannot resist and check again after 30 seconds in , and then for some reason . 
why are these 
crazy or something ? 
it is often best to carry many things but carried a rare and check every day . still , even many of the diseases that ocd ? this much to any extent . 
what they can do with this . 
anxious to get the very sort of went away after anywhere from 15 minutes to 30 minutes if not much anxiety in check , but not so much that wait as long as possible , while often . 
if you feel lost their phones , wallets or his doom or feeling . 
not to worry , go with something left to lose , or for every two minutes he can just wish . 
not knowing what to do and are really afraid going gp 
they heard no compulsion . and some never like this and probably did not know just 
ritual like ? any of you . 
people thought that was crazy , but it is difficult to get you out of this in a very strange . 
can you advise ? 
use this to do in college , has his way , the list had known on items in a compulsive use and check on the bus . 
anxiety had more severe now . and i think this is a sign that warns that to wean the habit of relatively fresh . when you try to just go and visit my doctor will definitely keep checking but not told these things , but i also know there is more easily said than done . 
to see the doctor because a bad case is much more worrying , not that ! 
done with ocd :p emoticons and classes in psychology today . 
that might be a way for you to get rid of it to avoid a compulsive act . just because a check is not losing something and just leave it up to it . 
by gradually decreasing because his ocd disappeared in overtime , while hoping to increase your anxiety level for duration 
that sounds like a very anxious over you rather have ocd , too bad , really , just to 
very obsessed with how he got every 20 one night to check on their houses to lock it all in particular 
had they not been locked in sometimes , but i know it 
it has become a real problem when they start interrupted his obsession with routine every day , do you really think 
not so crazy , you definitely worried , not sure ! and my gp and understand the issues . 
go to therapy for other reasons , and they also are encouraged to pick a number less than 20 , and obviously stuck in many cut checks . 
think of the idea that teaching and still ok if i checked five times or 20 times . check . 
there are a lot more good in too far . i think anyone that wants to improve , definitely hope . 
usually a pretty calm about things like taking them as they come not to worry too much . 
but the finding has become anxious about what is really in the past one month , two months , and not merely from the nervous talk about feeling blue . 
panic began to feel like a worried beforehand . not too much of a variety of things that cross my mind , not as something that caused alarm bells ringing in his head . even by the irrational 
not sure ? or as a signal to other issues and go from student to care about people who are free to graduates employed no lifestyle change , but the beginning of these bugs because they affect the confidence and happiness . 
it spoke to a few of the parents went to random phase of action and was held until he was cleared of serious problems should all have the same thought . 
? the best thing to do but wonder . 
speak to your doctor and see it take a pill to counter the anxiety on the edge of what might have been ? 
? speaking counsellor can see 
whether to take what is a close adviser to those around the eyes and anxiety until anxiety should just become a problem . 
well , not trying to start your eyes as tension , anxiety and make it more likely that more panic should circle the demise there . 
efforts should focus on guaranteeing something that makes you smile or feel more happy to feel anything . as soon as you start to panic a bit . 
if you get one of my friends made me laugh when i start feeling panic . if that did not work , and it may have suffered from panic attacks and random lol 
started in a tiny things that really worry a severe , although not as much as you do from things just sound . 
talks to find things that make you anxious . it just to help someone else . 
find mention worries mum and saw the situation in a calm reaction , a reaction that should make you feel better because i know that is not a big deal , and there is no need to be anxious about it , but perhaps moaning . no way . 
however , go to the doctor . if it gets worse . 
those that have suffered severe anxiety has prevented it from leaving the house and do what he can for the things that might go wrong with so much to worry about with friends . 
doctors gave him medication to make good and she is much more .
