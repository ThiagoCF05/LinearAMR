there are many who have a sense of urgency , quietly watching how things develop , you are dragons coiling , you are tigers crouching , i admire noble @-@ minded patriots .
has history given us too many lessons ? , 530 , 412 , 64
taking a look
the ones who are suffering are the ordinary people : even if the body of a salted fish is turned over , it is still a salted fish ...
freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,
what is more they are considered traitors of __name1__ , which is a fact of cultural tyranny in the cloak of nationalism and patriotism .
in fact , the __name1__ no longer needs to use force to deal with __name2__ , they have achieved the result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting ".
is the article too intense , is the __name1__ so good ?
if things are not seen by eyes and heard by ears yourself , do not assume their existence , __quant1__ people create a tiger .
just passing by and taking a look . won't express my opinion
came to study and learn
very attractive
it should vigorously advocated
some people - do n't forget you are __name1__ ; if the country needs me , i 'll be compelled by my sense of righteousness !
i really especially hate those who are eating __name1__ things and drinking chinese things , but who say __name2__ is so whatever , those dogs , if __name3__ is so good go find your american illegitimate fathers
i feel our people should learn more from the __name1__ , the banner of __name2__ needs to be held , but __name3__ thought can n't be forgotten !
only __name1__ thought , can save the nation !
there too many traitors of __name1__ !
patriotism is the bottom line . everyone must prove worthy of the nation
i think it is not those elites , but that some corrupt officials were bribed
remove this group of jerks !
i 'm just taking a look
there are so many traitors in the history of __name1__ - we need to be vigilant .
with the chaos in __name2__ and __name3__ , we also had no choice but to prevent the running dog traitors from colluding with __name1__ imperialism .
everything has its set number , it 's not time for a change in the weather in __name1__ , traitors can only bark madly like dogs and nothing else , can only make them disappointed .
it won't be long until people are coming from all directions to the __name1__ court . leading the world . this is the intent of heaven .
following with interest .
this just is a specialty of modern __name1__ there 's nothing we can do
there are too many traitors among our compatriots ,
freedom of speech is relative . we need take national conditions into account .
freedom of speech\thought , if people express a view somewhat different than the traditional view , and put forward slightly different criticism , then they are called slaves of foreigners , or are accused of reverence for and fascination by foreign things ,
to the person who said this i 'd like to ask which one of those mentioned above is your dad

in critical moments , we are all descendants of __name1__ emperor and __name2__ emperor .
look at the __name1__ @-@ __name2__ cooperation of those years and you will know ...
in the peaceful years , creating a ruckus does n't influence everybody cooperating when it 's time for war ...
it can compete with articles from the __name1__ , magnifying a problem to become a question of principle or of ideological line , buttoning the hat .
the __value1__ column will make those with vested interests in the __name1__ terrified , it 's a good thing
if you want to destroy a people , first of all is his national culture , whose tool is language and writing . currently the one which everyone who is going to the next grade or entering a higher school must all be tested on is __name1__ @-

you are a dragon coiling , you are a tiger crouching , it makes sense , wait for the opportunity
in fact , __name1__ no longer needs to use force to deal with __name2__ , they have reached a result of " defeating enemy soldiers without fighting " ...
yes . there are many slaves of foreigners . it 's time we should renovate !
the ruling authorities actually should pay attention to these kinds of capitulators and traitors of __name1__ ! comrade __name2__ once said that the __name3__ will not be overthrown - if it falls , it will be brought down from within the party itself . former __name5__ ambassador to __name6__ __name4__ once said in a speech in the us : we will raise __quant1__ spokespeople in china , let the chinese themselves topple china - and the __name7__ then used __quant3__ __quant2__ yuan subsidy to help these domestic so @-@ called elite , vowing that they want to let them raise the wind to make waves domestically , citizens definitely need to be alert for this and cannot let outsiders use us .
i have reasons to say this : these last several days __quant1__ have seen the suggestions given by the experts - with a glimpse __quant1__ see they are disciples of __name1__ !
__name1__ society allows these people to see the dawn of fairness and justice of democracy .
the domestic political development is truly too slow , being criticized by people whose ideology is a bit advanced is inevitable . can we blame others for this ?
saying that someone is bribed is improper ?
people are all selfish , reality also is often gray .
some propaganda activities of zf have soon become viewed as jokes by the people .
in this environment , what 's wrong if they criticize the previous stupefying propaganda a bit ?
we can n't look over the old accounts of the previous so @-@ called anti @-@ __name1__ war .
take a look at __name1__ , that 's our country many years ago . take a look at their ridiculous propaganda .
the __name1__ ' dream of occupying the whole world has never stopped , it is constantly being planned .
these days , there 's a kind of feeling that 's more and more intense : it 's that __name1__ , through long @-@ term bribing of the __name2__ intellectual elite has already succeeded in setting up a " __value1__ column ".
these people may consider themselves to be culture celebrities or may be of high authority and important position , and are distributed in various circles in society , taking great pains to promote __name1__ values* and brainwash the __name2__ people on behalf of the americans .
why is this kind of feeling getting more and more intense ?
because these days , i 've been reading part of the " specialist professor " blog , it would have been okay if i did n't read it , but after i read it , it made me really surprised .
for example , assistant professor zhang ming of __name1__ , the political intentions of many of his blogs are extremely obvious .
such as , in __quant1__ blog he attributed the reason for the prevalence of hostility in __name1__ to elementary school textbooks having " wang erxiao ", and he disparaged good articles that promote patriotism as not even worth a penny .
another example is so @-@ called " sexologist " and " social activist " __name1__ - one , her stuff is not similar to things like the treatise " haite sexology report "; two , she has no deep thought ; and three , she has no significant contributions .
she main relies on doing something novel and different and on shocking viewpoints to attract people 's eyes , but without real ability or learning , she 's purely a jumping clown ,
this kind of person puts on the big " specialist " hat just to intimidate people ; the key is that she is concerned about politics yet does n't understand politics , is willing to be a slave of foreigners yet is arrogant and overbearing , is ignorant yet feels fine .
like in the essay " a bit less hostility , a bit more harmony ", she completely denigrates class struggle and the anti @-@ pornography @-@ and @-@ illegal @-@ publications drive as social hostility ;
in the essay " china has already become the country which worships money most on the earth ", she attributes __name1__ society 's worship of money to atheism ;
the essay " are you studying paul or studying bill ? ", she blathers that " people who study paul will become terrorists ";
in the essay " recommendation for establishment of a constitutional court to solve the problem of pornographic products ", she takes citizens publishing pornographic novels to be freedom of speech , and says the __name1__ anti @-@ pornography drive is unconstitutional behavior , etc.
especially today 's masterpiece , " why is it worth paying such close attention to the jianghe obscene goods case ? ", where she is once again crying foul over several people suspected of involvement in erotic business activities who are being dealt with by __name1__ , as well as detailing a list of erotic products , with a deeper intent of doing publicity for other people ."
but these kind of jerky articles actually being put on top by __name1__ blog is really preposterous !
and there is also sichuanese poet __name1__ , who , while america clear to the eye and with swelling gall engages in containment of china and the people of the whole nation are feeling indignant , actually comes out with the fallacy " china and america are friendly ", and tries to pour spirit @-@ confusing soup on the __name2__ people willfully and without fear ;
__name1__ , who got famous by remarking upon the " __quant1__ countries ", whose talent and learning i have always respected , but i did n't expect that he was actually supporting the big traitor of __name3__ , __name2__ , saying some things like " i believe whoever disrespects mao yushi is not human ", once again making me very much drop my glasses !
also , as for the rumor on the internet a short time ago " complete notes on __quant1__ chinese celebrities who accepted political contributions from the __name2__ ", i feel that the segment of the intellectual elite in __name1__ who are " becoming treasonous " are increasingly ardent and have already become willful and without fear , to a level of publicly harming the country .
but i do not understand , when these people frequently make treasonous remarks , why no one curbs them and they , moreover , can continue to occupy high positions , calling the wind and rousing the rain among the intelligentsia and in public opinion ?
contacting " southern newspapers ", which were temporarily fierce a short while ago , i feel that part of the intellectual elite have possibly sunk together with media personalities !
i remember , __quant1__ @-@ some years ago the __name1__ had just fought a war with __name2__ , and still threatened china with the use of nuclear weapons ;
__quant1__ @-@ some years ago , the __name1__ entered __name2__ with the intention of containing __name3__ ;
although __quant5__ years ago it had established relations with __name2__ , __quant1__ years ago it again started imposing sanctions on china , __quant2__ years ago it bombed a chinese embassy , __quant3__ years ago the __name1__ collision incident occurred , and __quant4__ years ago it restarted its containment of china with great fanfare .
i do n't understand , why are we __name1__ so forgetful ?
why are there still so many people ignoring their conscience and speaking on the behalf of the __name1__ ?
without taking a big loss , people do n't improve their abilities to remember - this is possibly the greatest weakness of us __name1__ .
therefore , it also stands to reason that the forces of the traitors of __name1__ are rampaging and the __value1__ column is running rampant
it 's entirely possible - do n't we ourselves raise " traitors to __name1__ " among primary school students ?

rudolph agnew , __quant1__ years old and former chairman of __name1__ , was named a nonexecutive director of this __name2__ industrial conglomerate .
a form of asbestos once used to make __name1__ cigarette filters has caused a high percentage of __name2__ deaths among a group of workers exposed to it more than __quant1__ years ago , researchers reported .
the asbestos fiber , crocidolite , is unusually resilient __quant1__ it enters the lungs , with even brief exposures to it causing symptoms that show up __quant1__ later , researchers said .
__name1__ , the unit of __name3__ - based __name2__ that makes __name4__ cigarettes , stopped using crocidolite in its micronite cigarette filters in __year1__ .
although preliminary findings were reported more than __quant1__ year ago , the latest results appear in today 's __name1__ , a forum likely to bring new attention to the problem .
a __name1__ spokewoman said , `` this is an old story .
we 're talking about __quant1__ ago before anyone heard of asbestos having any questionable properties .
there is no asbestos in our products now . ''
neither __name1__ nor the researchers who studied the workers were aware of any research on smokers of the __name2__ cigarettes .
`` we have no useful information on whether users are at risk , '' said james a. talcott of __name2__ 's __name1__ - __name1__ .
dr. talcott led a team of researchers from the __name1__ and the medical schools of __name2__ and __name3__ .
the __name1__ spokeswoman said asbestos was used in `` very modest amounts '' in making paper for the filters in the early __decade1__ s and replaced with a different type of filter in __year1__ .
from __year1__ to __year2__ , __quant1__ kent cigarettes with the filters were sold , the company said .
among __quant2__ men who worked closely with the substance , __quant1__ have died -- more than three times the expected number .
__quant1__ of the __quant2__ surviving workers have asbestos - related diseases , including __quant3__ with recently diagnosed __name1__ .
the total of __quant1__ deaths from __name1__ , __name2__ and __name3__ was far higher than expected , the researchers said .
`` the morbidity rate is a striking finding among those of us who study asbestos - related diseases , '' said dr. talcott .
the percentage of __name1__ deaths among the workers at the west groton , __name2__ , paper factory appears to be the highest for any asbestos workers studied in __name3__ industrialized countries , he said .
the plant , which is owned by hollingsworth & vose co. , was under contract with __name1__ to make the cigarette filters .
the finding probably will support those who argue that the __name1__ should regulate the class of asbestos including crocidolite more stringently than the common kind of asbestos , chrysotile , found in most schools and other buildings , dr. talcott said .
the __name2__ is one of the few industrialized nations that does n't have a higher standard of regulation for the smooth , needle - like fibers such as crocidolite that are classified as amphobiles , according to brooke t. mossman , a professor of pathlogy at the __name1__ college of medicine .
more common chrysotile fibers are curly and are more easily rejected by the body , dr. mossman explained .
in __month1__ , the __name1__ imposed a gradual ban on virtually all uses of asbestos .
by __year1__ , almost all remaining uses of __name1__ - causing asbestos will be outlawed .
about 160 workers at a factory that made paper for the __name1__ filters were exposed to asbestos in the __decade1__ s .
areas of the factory were particularly dusty where the crocidolite was used .
workers dumped large burlap sacks of the imported material into a huge bin , poured in cotton and acetate fibers and mechanically mixed the dry fibers in a process used to make filters .
workers described `` clouds of blue dust '' that hung over parts of the factory , even though exhaust fans ventilated the area .
`` there 's no question that some of those workers and managers contracted asbestos - related diseases , '' said darrell phillips , vice president of human resources for hollingsworth & vose .
`` but you have to recognize that these events took place __quant1__ years ago .
it has no bearing on our work force today .
yields on money - market mutual funds continued to slide , amid signs that portfolio managers expect further declines in interest rates .
the average __quant2__ - day compound yield of the __quant1__ taxable funds tracked by __name1__ 's money fund report eased a fraction of a percentage point to __value2__ % from __value1__ % for the week ended tuesday .
compound yields assume reinvestment of dividends and that the current yield continues for __quant1__ year .
average maturity of the funds ' investments lengthened by __quant1__ day to __quant2__ days , the longest since early __month1__ , according to donoghue 's .
longer maturities are thought to indicate declining interest rates because they permit portfolio managers to retain relatively higher rates for a longer period .
shorter maturities are considered a sign of rising rates because portfolio managers can capture higher rates sooner .
the average maturity for funds open only to institutions , considered by some to be a stronger indicator because those managers watch the market closely , reached a high point for the year -- __quant1__ days .
nevertheless , said brenda malizia negus , editor of money fund report , yields `` may blip up again before they blip down '' because of recent rises in short - term interest rates .
the yield on __quant1__ - month __name1__ bills sold at monday 's auction , for example , rose to __value2__ % from __value1__ % .
despite recent declines in yields , investors continue to pour cash into money funds .
assets of the __quant1__ taxable funds grew by $ __quant2__ during the latest week , to $ __quant3__ .
typically , money - fund yields beat comparable short - term investments because portfolio managers can vary maturities and go after the highest rates .
the top money funds are currently yielding well over __value1__ % .
dreyfus world - wide dollar , the top - yielding fund , had a __quant2__ - day compound yield of __value1__ % during the latest week , down from __value2__ % __quant1__ week earlier .
it invests heavily in dollar - denominated securities overseas and is currently waiving management fees , which boosts its yield .
the average __quant2__ - day simple yield of the __quant1__ funds was __value1__ % , down from __value2__ % .
the __quant2__ - day simple yield fell to an average __value2__ % from __value1__ % ; the __quant2__ - day compound yield slid to an average __value4__ % from __value3__ % .
j.p. bolduc , vice chairman of __name1__ , which holds a __value1__ % interest in this energy - services company , was elected a director .
he succeeds terrence d. daniels , formerly a __name1__ vice chairman , who resigned .
__name1__ holds __quant1__ of grace energy 's __quant2__ board seats .
__name1__ said its __name2__ unit completed the sale of its bailey controls operations to __name3__ s.p . a. for $ __quant1__ .
__name1__ is an __name2__ state - owned holding company with interests in the mechanical engineering industry .
bailey controls , based in __name1__ , __name2__ , makes computerized industrial controls systems .
it employs __quant1__ people and has __quant3__ revenue of about $ __quant2__ .
the federal government suspended sales of __name1__ savings bonds because __name2__ has n't lifted the ceiling on government debt .
until __name2__ acts , the government has n't any authority to issue new debt obligations of any kind , the __name1__ said .
the government 's borrowing authority dropped at midnight tuesday to $ __quant2__ from $ __quant1__ .
legislation to lift the debt ceiling is ensnarled in the fight over cutting capital - gains taxes .
the __name1__ has voted to raise the ceiling to $ __quant1__ , but the __name2__ is n't expected to act until next week at the earliest .
the __name1__ said the __name2__ will default on __month1__ __day1__ if __name3__ does n't act by then .
clark j. vitulli was named senior vice president and general manager of this __name3__ sales and marketing arm of __name2__ auto maker __name1__ .
in the new position he will oversee __name1__ 's __name2__ sales , service , parts and marketing operations .
previously , mr. vitulli , __quant1__ years old , was general marketing manager of __name2__ 's __name1__ division .
he had been a sales and marketing executive with __name1__ for __quant1__ years .
when it 's time for their __quant1__ powwow , the nation 's manufacturing titans typically jet off to the sunny confines of resort towns like __name1__ and __name2__ .
not this year .
the __name1__ settled on the hoosier capital of __name2__ for its fall board meeting .
and the city decided to treat its guests more like royalty or rock stars than factory owners .
the idea , of course : to prove to __quant1__ corporate decision makers that the buckle on the __name1__ is n't so rusty after all , that it 's a good place for a company to expand .
on the receiving end of the message were officials from giants like __name1__ and __name2__ , along with lesser knowns like trojan steel and the valley queen cheese factory .
for starters , the executives joined mayor __name1__ for an evening of the __name2__ and a guest pianist - comedian __name3__ .
champagne and dessert followed .
the next morning , with a police escort , busloads of executives and their wives raced to the __name1__ , unimpeded by traffic or red lights .
the governor could n't make it , so the lieutenant governor welcomed the special guests .
a buffet breakfast was held in the museum , where food and drinks are banned to everyday visitors .
then , in the guests ' honor , the speedway hauled out __quant1__ drivers , crews and even the official __name1__ announcer for a __quant2__ - lap exhibition race .
after the race , __name1__ executives drooled like schoolboys over the cars and drivers .
no dummies , the drivers pointed out they still had space on their machines for another sponsor 's name or two .
back downtown , the execs squeezed in a few meetings at the hotel before boarding the buses again .
this time , it was for dinner and dancing -- a block away .
under the stars and moons of the renovated indiana roof ballroom , __quant1__ of the hottest chefs in town fed them __name1__ duckling mousseline , lobster consomme , veal mignon and chocolate terrine with a raspberry sauce .
knowing a tasty -- and free -- meal when they eat one , the executives gave the chefs a standing ovation .
more than a few ceos say the red - carpet treatment tempts them to return to a heartland city for future meetings .
but for now , they 're looking forward to their winter meeting -- __name1__ in __month1__ .
__name1__ registered a trade deficit of $ __quant1__ in __month1__ , reflecting the country 's economic sluggishness , according to government figures released wednesday .
preliminary tallies by the __name1__ showed another trade deficit in __month1__ , the __value1__ __quant1__ setback this year , casting a cloud on __name2__ 's export - oriented economy .
exports in __month1__ stood at $ __quant1__ , a mere __value1__ % increase from __quant2__ year earlier , while imports increased sharply to $ __quant3__ , up __value2__ % from last __month2__ .
__name1__ 's economic boom , which began in __year1__ , stopped this year because of prolonged labor disputes , trade conflicts and sluggish exports .
government officials said exports at the end of the year would remain under a government target of $ __quant1__ .
despite the gloomy forecast , __name1__ has recorded a trade surplus of $ __quant1__ so far this year .
from __month3__ to __month1__ , the nation 's accumulated exports increased __value1__ % from the same period last year to $ __quant1__ .
imports were at $ __quant1__ , up __value1__ % .
__name1__ , trying to keep pace with rival __name2__ magazine , announced new advertising rates for __year1__ and said it will introduce a new incentive plan for advertisers .
the new ad plan from __name1__ , a unit of the __name2__ , is the __value1__ incentive plan the magazine has offered advertisers in __quant1__ years .
plans that give advertisers discounts for maintaining or increasing ad spending have become permanent fixtures at the news __quant1__ and underscore the fierce competition between __name1__ , __name3__ 's __name2__ , and __name5__ 's __name4__ .
alan spoon , recently named __name1__ president , said newsweek 's ad rates would increase __value1__ % in __month1__ .
a full , __quant1__ - color page in __name1__ will cost $ __quant2__ .
when the __name3__ collapsed in __year1__ , partisans of __name1__ claimed he had " won " the __name2__ .
although a careful review of the facts will show it was not true , the claim was that the __name1__ became overextended attempting to keep up with ray @-@ gun 's defense spending .
__name1__ , who was the president at the time , claimed that he had won the __name2__ since the collapse of the __name3__ happened on his watch .
regardless of how one views those claims , for many people -- capitalists especially -- heralded the " victory " of capitalism .
globalism was hailed by its partisans as the natural consequence of their " victory , " and the sensible way to bring the alleged blessings of a problematic freedom to the people of the world .
always impatient of any restaint , capitalists used this so @-@ called victory as justification for the opposition to , or calls for the roll @-@ back of any regulatory restraint .
but not everyone has agreed with that view of the world and of economic systems .
now , with the various " occupy " movements , it is ( or ought to be ) obvious that a great many people are less than enchanted with capitalism and its expression in the idustrial democracies , as well as in the countries into which capitalists from the industrial democracies go to invest .
what are your thoughts on capitalism and its activities ?
@setanta , unfettered capitalism has yielded an oligarchy .
governmental regulation is good for capitalisms evolution .
health and safety and environmental horrors need to be regulated otherwise industries will not ever do whats right for humanity .
@setanta , i do n't have a problem with capitalism -- i have a problem with unregulated capitalism .
i agree with this completely .
capitalism thrives when everyone understands the rules , plays by the rules and enforces the rules .
if everyone has to spend all their time trying to circumvent the rules , understand the rules or fighting against those not following the rules , that is where trouble really begins .
that 's the problem with " deregulation ".
removing rules does n't help business be more competitive , it means that businesses must race to the bottom to counter new businesses that start there .
it 's like changing the rules to __name1__ half way through the game so that all the previous purchases are meaningless .
that 's not a benefit to capitalism despite what some would tell you .
out of all of the examples i saw , the only one i would agree with is the bomb toting __name1__ .
that is extremely rude , though i can see the humor in it .
in a college , that kind of costume should not have a place .
but these kids are listing geisha costumes , sombreros + donkeys , and a few other costumes that they deem ' racially insensitive '
racially insensitive ?
have they not been to __name1__ ?
that is a huge part of their dress when you get farther away from the cities .
how is that being insulting ?
it is not showing someone doing something derogatory , it is using the clothes of a society for a costume .
a geisha is insensitive too .
again , ( my opinion only ) this is taking it way over board .
sometimes it seems people look for reasons to be offended .
it is about perspective frankly .
there will always be someone who sees something and wants to think the worst of it .
dressing in a costume or not dressing in one will not change that .
and why is it that only those races @/@ cultures are the spotlight of being insensitive ?
is it not just as rude to wear torn over alls , stained shirt , black out your teeth and be a white hillbilly ?
what about the woman who wears shorts , high heels and too much make up to be a hooker ?
there has to be a stop to this forever drive to find something insensitive .
and if someone wants to look for reasons they are being held back for what ever reason they have in their heads , they will always find justification no matter what .
but why are we as a so called free society really jumping on board this super pc behavior ?
why is it now ok to find the smallest thing to be offended about and throw it out as the new discrimination ?
and why are these rules only applied to two or three races ?
__name1__ , white , black , green , blue , short , tall , fat..
what have you , are all being made fun of in some way when it comes to costumes and __name1__ but only those __quant1__ races get the red light ?
isnt that racist ?
these students are bleeding idealism and have n't been tempered enough with time and cultural patina to realize that one should be able to laugh at oneself and one 's cultural obsessions and that these costumes are n't the evil mechanisms of racism they are betraying them to be .
this is an absolutely ridiculous thread .
i mean if racist costumes were actually being banned , you all might have a point .
i am as uptight about the plight of white people in the __name1__ as anyone is .
but did anyone else read the article ?
no one is banning __name1__ costumes..
no one is even talking about banning __name1__ costumes .
in fact no one in this story wants to ban anything , except for the people here who apparently want to ban posters .
these students have a simple goal .
they say "... if we can change a few people or make a few people think , then that 's awesome ".
they are n't banning anything or stopping anybody from doing anything .
this story is about students expressing free speech .
they are making posters expressing their opinion .
of course if you want to wear a costume that others find offensive it is free speech .
but me complaining about your costume being offensive is also free speech .
neither should be banned .
and that is the way it works .
whether your costume involves black face and a noose , or whether it is a grilled sandwich where i think the cheese is a little too drippy is irrelevant .
free speech is free speech and expressing free speech is actually opposite of the " banning " that is being alleged .
you all have turned this story on it 's end .
so dear massachusetters , does she have any chance in dethroning the sitting __name2__ senator , __name1__ ?
why does __name1__ need to be dethroned ? i kinda like him ...
could __name1__ beat __name2__ ?
i 'm not sure what either of them look like , but the most brutal fight __quant1__ ever saw was a girl fight , lots of kicking , scratching , and some amazing punches ( the loser had to stay home from school for almost __quant1__ week until swelling went down around her eyes )
so i 'm gonna say yes
i 'm thinking in terms of the __name1__ getting __quant1__ more __name2__ seat .
in __name2__ , it would seem a lot easier task then in other __name1__ races .
i 'm thinking the best thing to do is keep the few moderate __name1__ we have right where they are .
he may vote along party lines for most things but he 's reasonable when it comes to representing a liberal @-@ leaning constituency .
do n't know , but it sounds like a real bellweather contest , does n't it ?
it would have made for some really great off year contest .
care to explain why you think he is an idiot ?
he did beat __name1__ rather convincingly .
he served as a state senator for several years .
he even voted for several __name1__ bills .
__name1__ was a bad candidate who ran a terrible campaign - i 'll hunt around for a great article __quant1__ read __quant1__ year ago outlining the tremendous mistakes she made .
as for __name1__ , he has a difficult time answering questions about policy in a cogent fashion .
i have seen him on several occasions give answers which show that he has no real understanding of the underlying issue at all , and several which are really just embarrassing .
i have n't really been active in ( or even really cared about ) politics until recently and i 'm really just looking for other peoples opinions on this .
well , just telling you who i 'll vote for probably won't inform you much though right ?
what issues are important to you ?
__name1__ because i think he has done a good job in most areas ; some areas he let me down , plus there is no way i would vote for a __name2__ today .
( i have a few times in the past , mostly local )
anyone who is not a __name1__ .
i think the majority of them are the reason this country has become constipated concerning everything that is important .
they are willing to throw __name1__ under the bus in order to make __name2__ look bad .
ok , " and why " does add a lot , you 're right .
i 'm voting for __name1__ because __quant1__ think he has done a good job in difficult circumstances , and can do much more with another term , and because __quant1__ really worry about what any of the possible __name2__ nominees would do as president if __quant1__ of them won .
i also would n't vote for just about any __name3__ ( especially __name2__ ) but i have heard some good things about __name1__ , he 's about the only __name3__ that i 'm actually interested in learning more about .
my own opinion of __name1__ is that i 'm happy that he 's in the race , and especially in debates .
i like how he 's anti @-@ war and anti @-@ bullshit in general .
i would absolutely not want him to be president , though .
__name1__ has a lot of posts on him , that might be a good place to start if you 're interested in learning more .
here 's his un @-@ endorsement of __name1__ ( he endorsed him , then had __value1__ thoughts ) :
i read a fascinating piece in the __name1__ today .
the author spoke about how __name1__ 's approval ratings are at a dismal low .
he apparently appears to be unable to pull __name1__ together to accomplish much , and in the author 's opinion , it would only get worse if he got elected to a __value1__ term .
he would like __name1__ to bow out for a __value1__ nd term , and have __name2__ run for president .
he believes that __name1__ has the best chance of bringing the country together .
i do n't know how she feels about running , but , imo , i think that it is a great idea .
she certainly has the smarts , the experience , and the approval of the majority of citizens .
i think that the people on the __name1__ side of the fence , are a poor bunch .
there is not a one in the bunch who would capture the imagination of the __name1__ people .
the voters who will decide this election , imo are the moderates and the independents . they certainly will not vote for any of the anti @-@ gay , pro @-@ life __name1__ bangers .
what do you think ?
should __name1__ step down for the good of the country ?
should __name1__ run ?
__name1__ 's time has come , and gone ...
she would make her self no friend of the __name1__ by dividing them and losing the black vote ...
no one is going to vote for her that did not vote for __name1__ , and a whole lot less obama voters will vote for her ...
do n't worry though..
she has enough sense to not try to run against a sitting president from her own party ...
best case scenario : __name1__ gets reelected and the country continues to slide backwards even if the __name2__ gain a greater foothold of the __name4__ __name3__ and increase their collective mass in the us __name5__ .
worst case scenario : __name1__ ( any __name2__ candidate other then __name3__ , __name4__ , or __name5__ ) will take the election .
then that means the __name1__ would likely further gain in __name2__ and even the __name3__ perhaps .
then the country slides right back into the deepest of recessions .
i suspect you are wrong on the voting inclinations of the moderates , and especially the ones you call tea baggers .
actually , i think you are wrong on the moderate @/@ independent voter turnout , too , but i could be wrong .
i 'm expecting a fairly good anti __name1__ turnout amongst that group .
i could accept __name1__ .
like phoenix , i 'm not greatly impressed by the __name1__ field .
not crazy about the presumed __name1__ candidate either .
on the other hand , __name1__ stepping aside seems even less likely than __name2__ giving up .
i guess that in summary , i 'm not optimistic about the future of the country for the next __quant1__ years .
kudos to __name1__ ! . they realize that it 's not about just voting the party line , it 's about voting for what 's right .
@jcboy , did they actually vote for gay marriage yet ?
i 'm getting a mixed message with the __name1__
@tsarstepan , they sure did !
hopefully , other states will realize gay marriage hurts nobody .
look at __name1__ . they have had it since __year1__ .
have you heard of their society falling apart ? of course not .
i think with __name1__ , then __name2__ , it will rapidly spread across the country .
you can n't stop this train !
@jcboy , i hope that the us __name1__ addresses this issue soon and just makes the whole state by state journey moot by making same sex marriage a national law .
@jcboy , you are correct .
whether one 's home state will recognize a same sex marriage from out of state is another matter .
when i studied the domestic relations law of __name1__ , i thought it was a damned indignity for a government to give permission to citizens to marry .
the citizens created the damned government , their child . david
did you guys hear about that plane crash that crashed into a helicopter ?
i have no idea how that happened .
what do you think ?
that is a congested airway , and when you fly under __quant1__ feet you have no aid from air traffic controllers .
accidents happen , but this particular area may need additional regulation ( such as a minimum altitude requirement for the tourist helicopters ) .
my husband , our kids , and myself were spending __quant1__ day out by the oceanside with another couple and their kids , our long @-@ time friends .
at some point we came across a huge fallen tree , and our friend l. climbed on it and started walking up .
our __quant1__ year @-@ old son followed him , but l. suddenly realized they won't be able to get down that easily .
he turned back and asked our son to get away and down to give him room to get down , too .
our son stopped but did n't get out of his way at once .
he was having fun , and we had to tell him 2 more times , and then he obeyed .
after that l. got back down , and he suddenly grabbed our son from behind and threw him on the ground with all his might , yelling at him .
we were stupefied .
a __quant2__ lbs __quant1__ year old man could have easily injured him .
fortunately he got up unscathed albeit very frightened .
we are in deep shock , we never hit our children .
does anybody know if there are legal ways to teach the man a lesson - but not monetary ?
is there any point in filing a police report ?
personally , if someone is my friend , i am going to deal with the situation on a person to person level .
why can n't you make it sure that you were really upset and that you do n't want them hitting your kids ever again .
legally , there are __quant1__ remedies .
there is monetary damages , and there is jail time .
i suppose you could add probation ( but that is just a replacement for jail time ) .
if you go the legal route , that pretty much ends the friendship no matter what happens .
if i was angry enough to start down this path i would n't worry about where it ended up .
i would probably express my feelings on the situation and make it clear that it was not to happen again .
your son was assaulted .
that is what the behaviour of your ex @-@ friend would be named legally .
he did n't hurt your child physically , so it was the lesser form of assault ( assault causing physical harm is seen as more serious .)
you certainly could file a police report ....
i do n't know the law where you are , here , it is quite likely that police would go around and question the man , making it clear that ( if your description is accurate ) he had committed an offence , but you could decide against filing charges .
again , depending on where you live , you could likely notyify child protection authorities .
here , being extra @-@ familial , and given that you have already decided not to expose your child to hm again , they would simply hand it to police .
if you release a legal genie from the bottle , though , you lose control of what the genie does .
for instance , you and your son would need to make a formal statement .
it might be that police act even if you do n't want them to .
it might go to court .
i 'd personally not choose to do it tthat way ... though you could certainly chat to local police without naming names and see if there is such a thing as a stern chat , or a formal caution to be had in your area .
i 'd hope that a stern talk from you and the loss of the friendship would be a big message to him .
however , my concern would be how he treats his own kids .
that was one hell of an over @-@ reaction .
if you have evidence that he assaults his own kids , i 'd be considering a chold protection notification .
is your kid ok ?
that would have been scary .
is he having nightmares or anything ?
i 'd also be having a chat with him about his behaviour .
it did n't warrant such a reaction , but he was thoughtless .
if it was really unusual behaviour from your friend , i am a bit worried about him , too , frankly .
i am a __quant1__ year old woman , and i have been in a __quant3__ year relationship with a __quant2__ year old married man .
he has __quant1__ kids __quant3__ , from his marriage and __quant3__ from a previous relationship .
he has been planning to get a divorce since the __value1__ day we met ,
things are so heated between us , i do n't know what to do .
he is planning on moving out of the house by the end of the year , he and his wife do not see eye to eye .
he was having sex chats with a lady he met on __name1__ from __name2__ ,
when i found out it affected me really badly .
i felt and still feel betrayed and i can n't trust him .
how do i let go ?
@jeje , you just walk away .
do you really think so little of yourself that you believe this is the best you can do ?
a married man who if he really was in love with you would just go ahead and file for divorce now , or at least move out of his house now .
a man who while having a relationship with you is involved in sex chats online with others .
personally , when you mess with a married man you deserve exactly what you get .
i have little or no pity for you .
but , you can do yourself a world of good by just walking away from him .
then why do n't you think about looking for someone who is not attached .
your odds of finding happiness are a bit better going that route in my opinion .

taiwanese vice president __name1__ warned on __day1__ that the transfer __name4__ __name3__ technology to the __name4__ could encourage the __name5__ government to invade __name2__ .
__name1__ noted that the __name2__ adopted a resolution to ban arms sales to mainland __name3__ after the __name4__ and said it is worrisome that the leaders of __name5__ and __name6__ are reportedly seeking to lift the ban following __quant1__ of commercial interest enticements by the __name7__ government .
__name1__ expressed concern that __name2__ advanced technology will be transferred to the mainland and added that such transfers would be helpful for the __name4__ government 's military buildup and will therefore encourage an invasion of __name3__ by the mainland .
__name1__ said that the government of mainland __name2__ has tried to isolate __name3__ diplomatically and has been increasing its military buildup against taiwan .
__name1__ said the __name2__ government has deployed around 500 missiles targeting __name3__ and the number of missiles deployed is expected to increase to 650 next year .
__name1__ described the __name2__ government as a real international terrorist because of the threat of missiles aimed at __name3__ and the prc 's preparations to invade taiwan .
__name1__ added that this is why __name3__ president __name2__ @-@ __name2__ called for a peace referendum for __year1__ alongside the __name3__ presidential election .
__name1__ said __name2__ nations should not join the __name3__ government in opposing __name4__ 's planned referendum .
__name1__ said that __name3__ is not a part __name2__ the __name2__ and has maintained substantive relations with almost all countries around the world even though most of them do not have diplomatic relations with taiwan .
__name1__ has never ceased making efforts to participate in international activities and has made great contributions to global development despite being refused membership by many international organizations .

__name2__ __name1__ may not approve taiwanese participation in the construction of submarines sold from the __name3__ .
a delegation of __name1__ legislators completed an __quant1__ @-@ day fact @-@ finding trip to the __name2__ .
the __name2__ __name1__ submitted a nt $ __quant1__ ( us $ 18.23 billion ) special budget to buy __quant2__ patriot pac @-@ iii missiles , __quant3__ conventional submarines and __quant4__ p @-@ 3 c anti @-@ submarine aircraft from the __name3__ earlier this month .
the budget is now pending approval by the __name1__ .
__name1__ @-@ __name1__ , the __name3__ ( dpp ) whip at the __name2__ legislature said on __year1__ that discussions are turning negative in regard to whether the __name4__ corp. ( csbc ) should take part in the construction of submarines which the __name5__ has promised to sell to taiwan .
__name1__ commander @-@ in @-@ chief miao yung @-@ ching called on the __name2__ to communicate on the review of the arms procurement budget of which the submarine deal is a part .
miao said it is not feasible for __name1__ to take part in the construction of the submarines and that the __name2__ will negotiate with the __name3__ on obtaining repair capacity and technology transfers .
miao said that no countries want to buy conventional submarines .
this would make it futile to give the __name1__ the capacity to build them .
the __name1__ has control of the key technology in building the submarines .
lee wen @-@ chung is another __name1__ legislator who has been involved .
lee said on __year1__ that the delegation asked the __name1__ to shorten the delivery period of the submarines from __quant1__ years to __quant2__ years .
this indicates that __name1__ has already given up the policy of building the submarines itself .
lee said that if the submarines are not built by __name1__ then the cost of the __quant1__ subs will be nt $ __quant2__ less than the original plan of nt $ __quant3__ .
lee 's figures were based on the price tags of submarines sold from __name1__ and __name2__ along with the cost of obtaining repair capacity .
lee was asked if the long delivery period of __quant1__ years might affect __name1__ 's military strength and tip the military cross @-@ __name2__ balance toward mainland __name3__ after __year1__ .

on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ __name1__ customs agents in the northwestern port city of __name3__ boarded the __name2__ freighter kuwolsan .
following a melee with the crew of the kuwolsan , customs agents discovered an assembly line for ballistic missiles .
__name1__ intelligence officials stated __name2__ government was the intended recipient of the cargo .
the kuwolsan departed __name2__ 's __name1__ harbor on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ .
records show that on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ the kuwolsan made detours to __quant1__ __name1__ ports to pick up __quant2__ tons of sugar for resale along the way to the kuwolsan 's destination .
the kuwolsan switched course in order to sell the sugar to an __name2__ company after a deal to sell the sugar to __name1__ failed .
an __name1__ investigator stated that the crew of the kuwolsan should not have picked up extra cargo at several ports when carrying __quant1__ tons of sensitive equipment and that such activity was crazy .
__name1__ customs officials were tipped off to possible contraband on the kuwolsan while the kuwolsan was en route to __name2__ .
the kuwolsan was rumored to be carrying arms or ammunition possibly intended for __name1__ .
__name1__ port officials were waiting when the kuwolsan arrived in __name2__ on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ .
irregularities in the kuwolsan 's papers were apparent within the __value1__ few hours of investigation .
__name1__ officials learned that the company in __name2__ listed as the intended recipient of the cargo was fictitious .
__name1__ officials questioned why anyone in malta would choose to buy water refining equipment from __name2__ when __name4__ is a short flight from __name3__ .
__name1__ customs agents questioned the captain of the kuwolsan tae min hun .
tae blocked every request and threatened international reprisals if __name1__ officials did not allow tae to leave __name2__ .
on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ customs officials demanded to search the kuwolsan 's cargo boxes and tae stated that the kuwolsan had received a telex from __name1__ officials .
tae received instructions from officials in __name1__ to allow no one to open the cargo boxes at all costs .
the official __name1__ after @-@ action report stated tae would not open any more boxes as per the telex .
the report stated the crew members shouted at and abused the customs officers .
according to witness accounts and video footage of the encounter , tae and the crew of the kuwolsan barricaded the doors of the kuwolsan with the crews ' bodies .
an __name1__ official who was present on the kuwolsan and who spoke on the condition of anonymity stated the situation became physical and there were fisticuffs .
the official stated the crew began closing the hatches to the cargo hold with the customs inspectors still inside .
on __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ armed troops and a group of government weapons experts aided customs officials and gained forcible entry onto the kuwolsan .
a few crates among the kuwolsan 's cargo contained equipment that could be used in a water treatment plant .
inspectors found pumps , nozzles and a few valves .
the cargo boxes were labeled as water refinement equipment .
documents from the investigation contain a partial list of the contents of most of the cargo crates which included --
components for missile subassembly .
machine tools for setting up a fabrication facility .
instrumentation for evaluating the performance of a full missile system .
equipment for calibrating missile components .
rocket nose cones , stacks of metal pipe and heavy @-@ duty presses used for milling high @-@ grade steel .
a plate @-@ bending machine capable of rolling thick metal sheets , toroidal air bottles used to guide warheads after separation from a missile , and theodolites that measure missile trajectories .
several boxes of engineering drawings , blueprints , notebooks , textbooks and reports .
personal items presumably intended for __name2__ workers , including cookbooks in __name1__ , __name1__ spices , pickles and acupuncture sets .
an __name1__ government official familiar with the kuwolsan discovery stated that in the past officials had seen missiles or engine parts , but here was an entire assembly line for missiles offered for sale .
the official stated that this was a complete technology transfer .
a technical committee of __name1__ missile experts stated that the equipment was unimpeachable and irrefutable evidence of a plan to transfer not just missiles but missile @-@ making capability .
the technical panel wrote in a report that the cargo points to only one end @-@ use , namely the assembling of missiles and manufacture of the parts and subassemblies of surface to surface missiles .
investigators searched the blueprints that were kept inside numbered plastic jackets and wrapped in brown paper .
some of the packets were labeled in __name3__ as __name1__ or __name2__ c. nearly all of the drawings showed rockets or sections of rockets with notes and mathematical formulas handwritten in korean .
native __name1__ speakers assisted in translation but the documents contained technical code invented by __name2__ scientists to replace scientific terms in __name3__ or __name4__ .
the investigation ultimately yielded information about __name1__ 's weapons program which __name2__ authorities shared with ally governments .
the scud b and __name1__ designs found on the kuwolsan were from older __name2__ missile programs which were derived from __name3__ missile designs of the __decade1__ s .
__quant1__ __name1__ government official who studied the blueprints stated the science was old and dated but still functional .
retired director of the __name3__ 's office on strategic , proliferation and military issues in the __name2__ __name1__ stated the __name4__ utilized the blueprints to make full mock @-@ ups of missiles complete with decals .
the blueprints included information pertaining to the inner workings of __name1__ 's missile industry which has been the focus of contention between the __name2__ and north korea since the __decade1__ s .
the cargo on the kuwolsan did not include everything needed for missile production which raises the possibility that there may have been earlier and possible later shipments .
missile expert and senior analyst at the __name1__ timothy v. mccarthy examined some of the blueprints and other evidence and stated this was a slice in time of a technology transfer from __name3__ to __name2__ .
mccarthy stated the intelligence find helps __name1__ officials learn how __name2__ missile scientists learn .
mccarthy stated the information gives __name2__ officials an idea of how capable __name1__ scientists are of progressing to more advanced missiles and gives __name2__ officials insight into the aspect of proliferation when one country 's officials attempt to transfer technology to another country 's officials .
mccarthy stated no one can stop __name1__ scientists once the scientists are capable of making missiles .
the kuwolsan and the crew were unaccounted for after __name1__ officials released the kuwolsan in __year1__ .
shipping experts at lloyd 's maritime division in __name1__ stated the kuwolsan 's name was changed in the summer of __year1__ to sun grisan 9 .
as of the week of __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ the sun grisan 9 was still in service and was last reported headed to the __name2__ capital of __name1__ .
the nature of the sun grisan 9 's cargo was unknown .
as of __day1__ __month1__ __year1__ the evidence from the kuwolsan is secured in a military warehouse in __name1__ .
as stated in court documents and interviews with officials in the __name1__ and __name2__ the kuwolsan incident has reinforced a view of __name3__ as the world 's most dangerous source of weapons proliferation .
in __year1__ __name2__ leader __name1__ expelled __name3__ inspectors , abandoned the __name4__ @-@ __name4__ and declared plans to build an atomic weapon .
